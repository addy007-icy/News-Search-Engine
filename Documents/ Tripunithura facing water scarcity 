: Tripunithura is facing a water crisis even before the onset of summer as the water level in the Choondi river is reportedly very low.While officials of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), Tripunithura sub-division, say the supply from the Choondi plant to Tripunithura at 10 million litres a day (mld) falls much short of demand, the current supply for the last one week is about 5-6 million litres a day (mld).For the last one week, many houses have gone without water.Pump dysfunctionalTalking to The Hindu , an official at the Choondi water treatment plant said only one of the two motor pumps located at Ramamangalam could be operated to draw raw water into the strainer.Water level being low, it does not support working of both the pumps to draw raw water.As a result, the production at the Choondi plant had come down to about 15-16 mld.According to the official, the existing temporary bund was insufficient to channelise enough water into the intake well, hence, another bund to raise the water level at the intake point was necessary.Irrigation officials had inspected the site at Ramamangalam and a survey will be conducted on Monday on the required bund.A decision would be taken soon to restore the working of the plant to produce about 24 mld of water every day.Check-damKWA officials said a check-dam would be a permanent solution to resolve the crisis as this would curtail the yearly cost incurred on building the temporary bund. Though a proposal for the same had been made, no concrete decisions had come up in this regard.The Irrigation Department is responsible for the proposals and construction of check-dams or bunds.The Choodi plant provides water mainly to Tripunithura and nearby panchayats of Chottanikkara and Udayamperoor.Households in Tripunithura get water only alternate days.The quantity received by Tripunithura from Karingachira sump is pumped twice daily from the Eroor water tank â€” one day to north of Tripunithura and next day to the south.
