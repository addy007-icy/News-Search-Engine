In order to boost the city’s public transport system, the government has decided to run 1,000 new air-conditioned low-floor buses on public-private partnership (PPP) model in Delhi.“The government has decided to run 1,000 AC low-floor buses on PPP model. DTC will operate these buses. 1,000 AC buses will start coming on roads from July this year,” Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai said.The government decided to opt for the PPP model as DTC could not buy buses despite floating tenders two-three times as bus manufacturers did not show interest due to some conditions in the tenders.“Corporate entities will give buses to DTC. The government will allow these buses to park in DTC’s bus depots. DTC’s conductors will be deployed in these buses,” Mr. Rai said.As per the plan, earning-sharing with private concessionaires will be done on kilometre basis.
