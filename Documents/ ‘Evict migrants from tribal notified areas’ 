Tribal Peoples’ Council has opposed issuing of pattas for migrants at Moolakurichi in Rasipuram Taluk, which has been notified as tribal area, and demanded their eviction from the place.In a letter to Collector V. Dakshinamoorthy, council’s chairman K.A. Gunasekaran said that according to the Government Order 15 - 40 (standing), Moolakurichi has been notified as tribal area and only members of tribal community could get permanent settlement in the area. But, it is learnt that some of the migrants are trying to get patta with the influence of some vested interests. He said that it is the habit of migrants to sell the land back to the tribal’s after getting patta to the unjustified rates. He wanted the administration to conduct proper inquiry and initiate action against the criminals for exploiting the tribals.The letter said that the tribal people of Kolli Hills and its surrounding areas are being under suffocation because the district administration failed to recommend to the Government for proclaiming it as Scheduled Areas under 5{+t}{+h}Schedule of the Constitution despite of its justification. “This shows that there is lack of interest in protecting the interest of the tribal’s”, the letter said. The letter said that though there is Tribal Sub Plan (TSP), nothing has been done because of least importance being paid by the administration towards tribals. ‘Thus, in all the way tribals are being placed in disadvantaged position cutting across all the rights and privileges enshrined in the constitution’, the letter said.It is learnt that some of the migrants aretrying to gettitle deeds
