HYDERABAD: For those who take the Gunfoundry route, it is a sight not to be missed. The walls of Aliya School are splashed with colours and messages. It is not silly graffiti but street art engaging commuters and spreading a message. From domestic violence, abuse and acid attacks to save the girl child and the importance of education for girls, the street art forces passersby to think and in a way is a platform to create awareness on social causes.Street art is not new in Hyderabad. The bio-diversity meet held a few years ago saw artistes reclaiming the walls and the result was a makeover on the stretches of Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills and Madhapur. One also sees messages on civic issues taking an art form on walls of the city.The Aliya school street art (the school also houses a boys’ college) was done by children of 16 government schools with the help of an NGO Social Artist and in association with the US Consulate. “Street art is a major step towards sensitising the youth,” points out Udhvita of Social Artist. She adds how one can take the help of colours and strokes to bring in a new approach. “Be it on environment or social issues, street art helps in making a better impact. The more we talk about these issues, the more it helps in raising a consciousness. The visuals have a positive influence,” she adds.
