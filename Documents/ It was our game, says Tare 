Mumbai captain Aditya Tare said the team’s batting slipped in the 19th over, where it could manage only eight of the required 20 runs. Tare said the dismissals of Suryakumar Yadav in the 15th over and the penultimate ball dismissal of Abhishek Nayar spoiled the chances of a win against Karnataka.“In the end it came down to four balls, four runs and then two balls, two runs. Unfortunately, we lost (Abhishek) Nayar when we were poised for a win. It is difficult for a No 11 (Tambe) to come in and play the last ball for two runs,”Tare said.“It was our game in the last over with a first-ball six. Unfortunately, Nayar got out. Had he played for two or three more overs, it would have been an easy win for us. A couple of wickets fell in the middle overs – myself and Surya – that also made things difficult.”Karnataka captain R Vinay Kumar credited bowling in the death overs in IPL for seeing his team through. “I was very confident going into the last over with 12 runs needed. Most times it is very difficult to defend, but I have done that in the past in IPL defending less than 10 runs,” Vinay said. “That was running through in my mind and even after being hit for a first-ball six, I was confident that it will be our game.”‘Very good season’Vinay said the team is looking to recover after missing the knockouts in Ranji Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy. “Our team has always been confident. From outside it looks like an ordinary season. But overall our season has been very good. It has not been how it was in the last two years but we lost our chance narrowly. After losing the first game here, it was a must-win situation and it is nice see to the win coming from a good team effort,” he said.
