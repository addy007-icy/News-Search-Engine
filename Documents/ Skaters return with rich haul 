Telangana skaters set a record of sorts by bagging the highest ever number of medals – 33 in all including 19 gold, 10 silver and four bronze - in the 12{+t}{+h}National Ice Skating Championship in Gulmarg (Jammu & Kashmir).This is remarkable considering that Hyderabad doesn’t have any ice skating rink for even regular training. What is even more remarkable is that they have braved the extreme cold conditions, temperatures often touching -12 degrees. Captain Anup Kumar Yama said it was a fantastic achievement by his team and hoped this performance would ensure that the skaters have better facilities in Hyderabad to prepare themselves for the major international events. “Personally, my aim is to win a gold for India in the 2017 Asian Winter Games and also the 2018 Winter Olympics,” he said.
