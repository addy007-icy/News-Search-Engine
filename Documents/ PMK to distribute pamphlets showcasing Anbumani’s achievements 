With the elections getting closer, the Pattali Makkal Katchi has launched a pan-Tamil Nadu effort to project their chief ministerial candidate in a good light.Addressing a press conference in Chennai on Monday, PMK’s senior leader G.K. Mani said the party would distribute pamphlets enumerating Dr. Anbumani’s achievements in his political career to the electorate of Tamil Nadu.“This is an effort to project our leader to the people as an alternative to the DMK and AIADMK leaders. We will give it to every household and tell them that he is the only leader who can usher in change in Tamil Nadu,” he said. The pamphlet reads like a resume in which the party has listed his education, his achievements in sports, the continents he has visited, world leaders he has met and even hobbies.Significant space has been allocated to showcase what he did during his tenure as the Health Minister in UPA I from 2004 to 2009. The pamphlet credits him for the ‘National Urban and Rural health Mission’, and ‘National 108 Emergency Ambulance Service,’ among others. “His vision is to turn Tamil Nadu into a State where there is ‘not a single drop of alcohol and not a single paisa of corruption’,” said Mr.Mani. Ruling out out any alliance with the major Dravidian parties in the State, Mr. Mani said the party will be open to forming alliance insofar as other parties which accept the leadership of Dr. Anbumani.
