The Telangana Tourism Department is seriously considering to set up a Shilparamam in Nalgonda district headquarters on the lines of the one existing in Hyderabad.Leaving no stone unturned to attract tourists from across the globe, the Telangana Tourism Department has been aggressively introducing innovative facilities at most of the prominent tourism spots across the State since its formation. Sources said that the officials from the district took up the demand for setting up a Shilparamamam with G. Kishan Rao, the State Government’s advisor. “Accepting the proposal, Mr. Kishan Rao said that they would soon write to District Collector, P. Satyanarayana Reddy for identification of suitable land for the purpose , the source said.The department is considering a spot on Devarakonda road in town as they got to know that there was suitable piece of land available around there. The rich arts and crafts of the district and Telangana will be on display and several museums like rural Museum and others would come up in Shilparamam.The department will soon bring to the notice of Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao about the proposal and seek required funds and grant for suitable land. Since the Tourism Department is also planning to develop the historic Chaya Someshwara Swamy Temple, Patchala Someshwara Swamy Temple, District Archaeological Museum and Udayasamudram Reservoir located in Panagal, Sri Jedala Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple, Chervugattu, all located around 10 km from Nalgonda, the setting up of Shilparamam would further help the department to attract more tourists to the district. Welcoming the decision, noted writer from Nalgonda, Venu Sanoju observed that there was a dearth of recreation spots in Nalgonda particularly for children.The decision of Government would certainly fill the gap, he opined.
