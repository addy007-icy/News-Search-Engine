Former Minister and Kapu leader Mudragada Padmanabham on Tuesday came down heavily on the State government’s decision to invoke Section 30 of the Police Act, banning meeting or rallies in East Godavari district from January 3 to February 1. In an open letter to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, which was released to the media on Tuesday, he said the orders had been invoked in view of the ‘Kapu Ikya Garjana’ to be organised at Tuni on January 31. He said he and his community were prepared to face the wrath of police and organise the meeting on the scheduled date.If you fail to declare separate reservation for the Kapu community, we will be forced to revolt.Mudragada Padmanabham
