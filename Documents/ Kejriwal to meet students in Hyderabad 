After Rahul Gandhi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal is set to visit the University of Hyderabad on Thursday to meet the students.The Delhi Chief Minister will meet the students of Ambedkar Students Association of the University after Dalit scholar, Rohith Vemula, who was expelled following a tussle with students affiliated with the student wing of the BJP, Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), committed suicide.Over 300 supporters of the AAP’s Delhi unit and its student wing, Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti, besides party leader Ashutosh and MLAs Sandeep Kumar and Rakhi Birla, gathered at the Jantar Mantar to demand the resignation and arrest of Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya .The AAP also demanded that Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani’s role in the matter be investigated.The party plans to launch a country-wide protest on Thursday.Mr. Kejriwal had said that PM Modi should sack Ms. Irani and Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya and apologise to the nation. Terming the suicide a “murder of democracy, social justice and equality”, Mr. Kejriwal said the incident has shaken the “collective conscience” of the nation.The CM said the “searing injustice” of depriving Rohith Vemula and four other research scholars of their monthly stipend, library facilities, and their eventual suspension from Hyderabad Central University pushed the 28-year-old to take the extreme step.
