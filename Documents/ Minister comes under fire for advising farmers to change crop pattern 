The Bharatiya Janata Party has criticised H.S. Mahadeva Prasad, Minister for Cooperation and Sugar, for advising farmers to switch over to others crops from sugarcane owing to the repair work going on at the Mysore Sugar Company Ltd.Twenty-members of the city unit of the party staged a protest near Silver Jubilee Park on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here on Friday and raised slogans against the Minister and the State government.Mr. Prasad, who is also the chairman of the Mysugar company, had recently advised the farmers to shift from sugarcane to other crops. If the farmers were to do so, the machines at the sugar mills would get rusted and the owners suffer financial losses. Instead, the Minister should initiate steps to get the repair work at Mysugar company completed expeditiously, BJP member Manjunatha said in a statement issued later. He urged Mr. Prasad to direct the sugar mills to pay the statutory fair and remunerative price (FRP) to sugarcane suppliers.
