The complainant, who is a student, has said in her statement that she was sitting in the compound on Sunday afternoon when she saw Siddiqui’s personal guards deterring another resident from parking his motorbike inside the building’s parking space.“There had already been a dispute between members of the society during a meeting on Saturday evening over utilisation of extra parking space,” said an officer with the Versova police. “The society members had issued a notice to Siddiqui for using a parking space reserved for two wheelers to park his vehicles, and the woman, in her complaint, has said Siddiqui had refused to accept the notice.”On Sunday, when the complainant saw Siddiqui’s guards stopping the resident from parking his vehicle in an authorised space, she took pictures of the incident on her cellphone. A short while later, Siddiqui allegedly accosted her and warned her against taking any pictures in the future. During this argument, the actor allegedly manhandled her, after which she called the Mumbai Police helpline.A team of policemen was sent, and the complainant was escorted to the police station, where she registered a complaint against Siddiqui, the police said.
