Members of the Udupi District Bank Employees’ Association (UDBEA) staged a dharna in front of the Catholic Centre branch of the Syndicate Bank here on Friday.Addressing protesters, president of the association Ram Mohan said that the association was protesting against the violation of the bilateral settlement by five associate banks of the State Bank of India and their attempt to force unilateral service conditions on employees. The associate banks of SBI are State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad and State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur.A common settlement was signed between Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and AIBEA which had clearly delineated the duties and salaries of employees for various jobs in banks in May 2015. The five associate banks were parties to this settlement. It was wrong to change service conditions unilaterally.The protest was also against the discriminatory policies followed by the management of the SBI towards its associate banks. The management was forcing its service conditions on the associate banks, Mr. Mohan said.Herald D’Souza, secretary of the Udupi District Bank Employees Association, and Varadaraj, Narayana Bhat, Dayananda and Vijay Kumar Shetty, labour leaders, were present.
