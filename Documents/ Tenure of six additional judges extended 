: The President has extended by six months the tenure of six additional judges of the Kerala High Court.The judges whose tenure are extended are Justice P. Ubaid, Justice K. Abraham Mathew, Justice Alexander Thomas, Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque, Justice A. K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Anil K Narendran.The additional judges appointed for two years would usually be elevated as permanent judges on expiry of their tenure.The tenure of the six judges has now been extended in view of the fact that the Supreme Court was yet to finalise a new memorandum of procedure (MoP) on the appointment of members to the higher judiciary.
