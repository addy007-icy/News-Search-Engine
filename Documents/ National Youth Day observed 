Going through the writings of personalities such as Swami Vivekananda and imbibing their ideas in life will result in positive changes in our behaviour, medical neurologist P.N. Ravindra has said.Speaking at the National Youth Day programme at the KLE Society’s Institute of Nursing Sciences here on Tuesday, he said, “People will always have this conflict between their hearts and minds, which leads to a confused state of mind. It requires inner strength to overcome such confusion and tread the right path. Swami Vivekananda’s teachings will help one come out of this confused state of mind and move forward with greater courage.” There was a long list of eminent persons like William James, Rock Feller, Jamshedji Tata, Kiran Bedi and others who had been inspired by Swami Vivekananda.Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Ashram president Swami Raghuveerananda, who inaugurated the function, called upon students to focus on academic, physical and spiritual development. Referring to the power of prayer, he said that praying would have multiple benefits.
