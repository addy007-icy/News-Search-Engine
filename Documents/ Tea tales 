Last year, I visited a Tea Factory called Hi- Field during my vacation to Coonoor. I feel it’s always nice to visit places and gain knowledge. I enjoyed my visit to the factory. Tea leaves are plucked by women and weighed before they are put out to dry. They pluck only the baby leaves and buds. The leaves are then spread on the top with a fan beneath as it helps in removing the dust and moisture. This process is called Weathering. After eight hours it’s sent down through a tunnel into a crusher. Here the leaves get cut partially. This is called Crush Tear Curl also known as CTC. Then it is sent for fermentation where the colour of the leaf changes from green to brown. The leaves are now devoid of moisture. From here it goes for roasting from where we get our final form of tea. Mrithika Sudhakar, V D, Srimathi Sundaravalli Memorial School, Chennai
