: The Delhi High Court has expressed displeasure over dumping of construction material in large open spaces in Dwarka, while observing that such rubble was one of the biggest contributors to air pollution. The lack of cleanliness in and around ‘dhalaos’ (garbage dumps) in the area also attracted some adverse remarks from the court.Hearing a public interest litigation filed by a law student, Ebbani Aggarwal, a Division Bench of the court gave the South Delhi Municipal Corporation 15 days to clean ‘dhalaos’. The court was told that the local residents were dumping rubble and construction material illegally and the SDMC was responsible for their removal.The Bench, comprising Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, warned of disciplinary action against SDMC officers and sanitary superintendents if they failed to clean up the area. The court asked the petitioner student to examine on the spot if the SDMC was complying with the directions.Dealing with the issue of maintenance of pavements and drainage in Dwarka, the court directed the Delhi Development Authority to file a comprehensive status report on the maintenance of footpaths, work required for them and steps being taken to repair them. The report should also specify the steps taken to maintain drains in the sub-city, said the court.The petitioner, who has raised the issue of cleanliness in Dwarka, showed to the Bench some photos of garbage dumps surrounded by rubbish.In its defence, the SDMC counsel said that the civic body was cleaning up ‘dhalaos’, but the people were throwing rubbish outside the structures.After hearing arguments from both the sides, the court posted the matter for further hearing on February 3.
