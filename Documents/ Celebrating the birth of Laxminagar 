A 90-year-old resident of Laxminagar village in Papannapet mandal, Kommalapati China Akkaiah, was felicitated by Kommalapati Venkateswara Rao (85), another resident of the village, as part of the celebrations in connection with the birth of the village.The village came into existence in 1948, a year after the Indian Independence. The Telangana region was liberated from the Nizam rule by the Indian Government under the directions of the then Home Minister Sardar Vallab Bhai Patel.Chinna Akkaiah and Venkateswara Rao are the only two who are alive out of the 14 families that had migrated from Prakasham and Guntur districts of Andhra Pradesh to Laxminagar village in search of a livelihood in the newly-liberated State.“We sold our small chunks of land at our native places and migrated here along with our family. This area was like a forest then and we began our life by grazing cattle and slowly cleared the forest,” Chinna Akkaiah told The Hindu recalling the days when he first arrived here. For the first time in the recent past, the birth of a village was celebrated.“We honoured the two persons who are there since the formation of the village and it feels great. Later, we also held a meeting of all the five committees working in the village,” said Yedukondalu, a resident of the village.
