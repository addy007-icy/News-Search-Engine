It may be the office of a person who sets things in order around the city.But the scheme of things in the City Police Commissioner’s office on Infantry Road is anything but in order.To begin with, the building boasts of a huge cellar parking, which gets inundated every time it rains. What is worse, on many occasions in the recent past, staff clearing the parking area have recovered empty liquor bottles.The condition of the restrooms is deplorable. Sources said that any VIP who visits the Commissioner’s office is taken to senior police officers’ chambers if they want to use the restroom. Recently, Home Minister G. Parameshwar and DG&IGP Om Prakash, who visited the Commissioner’s office to participate in the crime prevention month, had to be escorted to the Commissioner's chamber to use the washroom.A complaint was made to the Home Minister. However, nothing has changed despite the Minister giving directions to the officials concerned to attend to the problems immediately.The new building was constructed in 2013 at a cost of Rs. 32.8 crore. It is spread over a massive 11,136 square metres.
