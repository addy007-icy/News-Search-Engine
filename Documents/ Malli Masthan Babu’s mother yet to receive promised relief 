Nearly 10 months after the death of internationally-acclaimed mountaineer Malli Masthan Babu, his mother Subbamma is yet to receive the five acres of land and other benefits promised to her by ruling party leaders and officials at that time.The issue came to light during the Janmabhoomi - Maa Vooru programme held in Gandhi Janasangham locality of Sangam mandal in Nellore district. After Masthan Babu was found dead in the Andes of Argentina in South America in March 2015, his body was brought for last rites to his native place.At that time, the government had announced 5 acres of irrigated land and also Rs.10,000 pension to Subbamma.Officials, however, declared during the Janmabhoomi programme that two acres of land was allotted to Subbamma in accordance with the announcement made at the time of cremation last year.When Subbamma asked the officials that she was actually promised more land, there was reportedly no response from them.Subbamma was not handed over the patta even for the two acres of land, her family members alleged.Mandal-level officials reportedly told Subbamma that the patta would be officially handed over to her at a programme to be attended by higher officers later. Meanwhile, Masthan Babu’s sympathisers say that it is unfortunate that Subbamma has not been handed over the patta even 10 months after the death of the mountaineer.A native of Gandhi Janasangham, Masthan Babu attracted attention world-wide for climbing each continent’s highest peak, including Mt. Everest, in the shortest time.Masthan Babu went missing in the Andes on March 24, 2015. After several days of intense international effort to rescue him, Masthan Babu was found dead in the mountain ranges.His fellow mountaineers later said that Masthan Babu was trapped in adverse weather while trying to return to a shelter.Considering his courageous mountaineering feats, commentators said that the mountains retained their favourite child.The State government announced State funeral in honour of Masthan Babu and bestowed favours on his mother at that time.After the noted mountaineer was found dead in the Andes, leaders and officials promised to allot five acres of land and pension to Subbamma
