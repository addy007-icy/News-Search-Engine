The State Human Rights Commission has deemed that the family of an employee who died while in State service was eligible for two pensions. K. Rema Devi, wife of Raveendran Nair, an employee of the Kerala State Housing Board who died in harness, petitioned to the commission that the board had denied her pension on the ground that her husband drew a pension for his military service.Commission chairperson J.B. Koshy found no anomaly in this and ruled that the petitioner was eligible for both pensions.
