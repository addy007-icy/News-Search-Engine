Renovation of the Parade Ground in Fort Kochi has been temporarily halted after remains of foundations of buildings that date back to the colonial era were discovered during an excavation.The chance discovery was made on Thursday morning as an excavator deployed by Kitco, the consultant engaged by Kerala Tourism for renovation works, threw up laterite bricks put together using lime.Former Corporation councillor who represented the area, Antony Kureethara, said that the bricks and stones might date back to the Portuguese era.The ground was used by the Portuguese, Dutch and English and they had buildings for housing soldiers and ammunition.“We must preserve history as it is, since this could become another heritage tourism attraction in Fort Kochi. The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has been informed and their experts are expected to inspect the relics. The relics must be preserved as they are, while the ground must be renovated to its past glory,” he said and called for manual digging to prevent damage to historical structures.The St. Francis Church located next door, where Vasco Da Gama was first buried, is a class-one monument on par with the Taj Mahal, said a source.“The ground has footprints of three colonial powers and the Union Jack was lowered here when India won independence,” he said.A senior tourism official said that a team of officials from the tourism department and Kitco inspected the site on Thursday. The ASI could step in and conserve a portion of the ground where the relics were found, he said.
