With the harvest season starting, Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation (KFCSC) is expecting the arrival of food grains to pick up from February.To make sure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce, the State government had launched the minimum support price (MSP) scheme in the last week of December to procure paddy, ragi and white jowar from farmers. KFCSC, the nodal agency for the scheme, has established direct procurement centres (DPC) at 120 places and plans to set up 45 more. The centres have received good response from farmers.Since the establishment of the DPCs, the farmers had sold 17,397 metric tonnes of paddy and 4,561 metric tonnes of ragi till January 18, said Rohini Sindhuri, managing director of KFCSC.Speaking to The Hindu over phone, Ms. Sindhuri said, “The harvest has begun in many parts of the State and we are expecting arrivals to pick up shortly.”Nevertheless, the procurement of white jowar was nil (till January 18) as the harvesting has just commenced.The corporation has opened 14 white jowar procurement centres across the State.Expected procurementThis season, procurement is unlikely to touch even 1.5 lakh metric tonnes. According to a senior officer at the Department of Agriculture, the prevailing drought situation has resulted in a drastic reduction in cultivation and yield.In 2014-15, KFCSC had procured 2.19 lakh metric tonnes of paddy, 1.35 lakh tonnes of ragi and 8,000 metric tonnes of jowar.The last date for supplying paddy and ragi is March 31, said Kumuda Sharath, Deputy Director of Food and Civil Supplies.Farmers will get Rs. 1,510 a quintal for paddy (common variety), and Rs. 2,100 for ragi and white jowar at the DPCs.Unhappy farmersIn some districts, farmers are unhappy with their district administration over delays in establishment of procurement centres.Although Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. had asked the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to open direct procurement centres , a few district administrations have not yet done so.This has been forcing the distressed farmers to sell their produce to middlemen, said Nagaraju, leader of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS).Recently, Ms. Sharath and other officials raided several places and seized 23,000 bags of ragi of 50 kg each from illegal hoarders.The corporation is contemplating requesting the officials concerned to open them, KFCSC sources further added.The corporation has opened 14 white jowar procurement centres acrossthe State.
