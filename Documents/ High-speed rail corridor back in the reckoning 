With the Thiruvananthapuram-Kannur high-speed rail (HSR) figuring in the Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s development agenda, the 430-km north-south rail corridor that is expected to give a boost to the economy and make travel hassle-free has shot into the limelight again.State Planning Board Member in charge of Transport E. Sreedharan is of the view that a strategy similar to the one adopted by the Centre for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR was needed for Kerala.“In that case, about 85 per cent of the cost and technology can be sourced from Japan with a moratorium of 10 years and repayment period of another 30 years and with a low interest rate of only 0.3 per cent for the loans,” he said. The Centre’s investment would be about Rs.7,500 crore and that by the State Rs.15,000 crore.Mr. Sreedharan, who is also the Principal Adviser, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, said the Detailed Project Report will be submitted in March to the government.The HSR will have a speed potential of 350 km per hour and Thiruvananthapuram to Kollam can be covered in 20 minutes, Kochi in 53 minutes, Kozhikode in 98 minutes, and Kannur in two hours.Trains will run every 15 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes during non-peak hours although the line will have the capacity to run trains every 3 minutes, if needed.Of the total 430 km to Kannur, the rail line will be elevated over 190 km and underground for 146 km. The land to be acquired will be 600 hectares.The affected structures are 3,868 and affected trees about 37,000.In the opening year, about a lakh passengers per day are expected to travel, which will go up to 1.25 lakh by 2025 and 1.75 lakh by 2040.The level of patronage can make the HSR financially self-supporting, he added.Road accidentsThe HSR will bring down road accidents by almost 30 per cent.
