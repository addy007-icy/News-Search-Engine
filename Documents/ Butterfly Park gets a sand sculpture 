Sand sculpture is a rare phenomenon to Tiruchi as it does not have beaches. But, P. Sasivarma (35), an artist belonging to Osaravilai in Kanyakumari district, has made it possible by creating a sculpture of the image of Mahatma Gandhi using sand.The sculpture was designed in front of the enthusiastic visitors, who thronged the Butterfly Park on Tuesday. It took nearly five hours for Sasivarma to give perfection to the sand sculpture of Gandhiji, the prime architect of the country’s freedom struggle. Mr. Sasivarma sculptured the image of Gandhi on the request of Forest Department, which is manning the Butterfly Park to the treat of visitors on the occasion of Republic Day. He used two lorry loads of sand for sculpturing the image.“Making sand sculpture is bit difficult in places except on beaches. However, I have designed the Gandhi sculpture in Tiruchi by utilising the available resources to recollect the contribution of freedom fighters led by him to the nation,” Mr. Sasivarma told The Hindu .According to an estimate, more than 8,000 people visited the park on Tuesday alone. Many of them did spend some time to enjoy the sand sculpture of Gandhi.Mr. Sasivarma had created sand sculptures of various images on the beaches of Thiruvananthapuram, Goa, Chennai and other places on several occasions.
