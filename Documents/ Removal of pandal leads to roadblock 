An attempt to remove a pandal put up for the indefinite agitation by farmers over the Kalasa Banduri Nala issue backfired here on Wednesday with the farmers and members of various agitations staging a roadblock for close to an hour at the busy Kittur Chennamma Circle.The reason for the snap protest was an attempt by the municipal administration to remove the pandal at Kittur Chennamma Circle to pave way for another function at the same venue for which councillor Shivanand Muttannavar had sought permission.In fact, trouble started after the workers belonging to the shamiana supplier started dismantling the pandal to which the farmers objected. Initially, when the farmers sought to know why the shamiana was being removed, the supplier reportedly said that there were unpaid bills. But subsequently it came to light that the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation Commissioner had asked the Assistant Commissioner of Police to remove the pandal, based on a letter submitted by the councillor (Shivanand Muttannavar) who had sought permission to conduct the birth anniversary of Sangolli Rayannna on the same premises.As news spread, farmers started gathering at the spot and Navalgund MLA N.H. Konaraddi and convenor of Mahadayi Kalasa Banduri Horata Samanvaya Samiti Vikas Soppin too joined them. As more farmers converged on the circle, the protesting crowd decided to block the junction throwing vehicular traffic out of gear.The protesters were particular that the Municipal Commissioner visit the spot and refused to vacate from the spot until his arrival.As the roadblock continued close to an hour, the police had a difficult time in streamlining traffic, and they diverted vehicles via alternative routes.Ultimately, the protesters cleared the roadblock after the Municipal Commissioner gave it to them in writing that the pandal meant for the protest would not be cleared. Earlier, speaking to presspersons, Mr. Konaraddi alleged that it was an attempt by the administration to weaken the farmers agitation in connection with the Mahadayi river waters issue.
