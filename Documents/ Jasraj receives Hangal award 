Music maestro Pandit Jasraj turned nostalgic and emotional at a function when he was conferred the Gangubai Hangal Lifetime Achievement Award by Gangubai Hangal Sangeet Mahotsav Committee here on Monday.Receiving the award, Mr. Jasraj said that he was overwhelmed with joy to receive the award named after renowned musician late Gangubai Hangal.He said that he was a fan of Gangubai and would often listen to her recorded music, while Gangubai had motherly love for him and helped him in shaping up his career as a vocalist.SupportRemembering the support extended by Gangubai, Mr. Jasraj said, “It was because of Gangubai that I could get a chance to perform at prestigious music conferences. A national music concert was held in 1967 in Hubli (now Hubballi). All stalwarts were invited to perform. I was a junior. But I too was invited because Gangubai wanted it.”Gangubai’s son Narayanrao Hangal presented the award to Mr. Jasraj.
