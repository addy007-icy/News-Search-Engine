Chinese mobile phone makers have started looking at India to set up base and may line up investments worth $2 to $3 billion in the next two years. The investments could help generate jobs for about 1 to 2 lakh people, said the Indian Cellular Association (ICA). “They (the Chinese companies) are still seeing India as the hottest next destination, ICA National President Pankaj Mohindroo said during a China-India Mobile Phone and Component Manufacturing Summit.
