A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday upheld the latest communication of the Travancore Devaswom Board barring former Sabarimala Tantri Kandararu Mohanaru from performing tantric rites at Sabarimala till the end of the criminal cases filed by him.The Bench comprising Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Anu Sivaraman passed the verdict while disposing of a writ petition filed by the former Tantri challenging the communication of the TDB Commissioner issued on July 31, 2015 informing him that he would not be allowed to perform the duties of the Tantri till the termination of the cases. In its communication, the TDB had referred to its decisions taken in 2012 and 2013 to keep the former Tantri out of the tantric duties at Sabarimala.The decision was taken in view of a case relating to blackmailing of the former Tantri.The accused had blackmailed Mohanaru after taking photographs of him and a woman in compromising positions and demanding Rs.30 lakh. The incident happened in 2006.All the six accused, including one Sobha John, were convicted. The revision petition filed by Sobha John against the conviction is still pending before the court.The court held that the TDBâ€™s communication was not violative of the fundamental right of the petitioner.
