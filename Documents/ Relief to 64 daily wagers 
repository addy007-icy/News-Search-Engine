The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the State government to continue the services of 64 persons working on daily wages at its two Benches at Kalaburagi and Dharwad till regular appointments are made. It also asked the government to pay them the minimum salary payable to a ‘D’ Group employee. A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and Justice Ravi Malimath passed the order while hearing a PIL petition, filed by High Court Legal Services Authority, seeking revision of pay for these daily wagers. Asking the government to treat the case of these 64 persons as a special one, the court observed that ‘injustice’ has been meted out to them as they were paid a meagre Rs. 3,500 a month, which is the pay for four hours of work every day, though they have been working for the entire day for several years.
