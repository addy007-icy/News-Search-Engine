After the murder of former sarpanch of Jerrela Sagina Venkata Ramana, a large number of Girijans living in villages around Jerrela are being harassed by the police and held in illegal custody, allege the CPI (M), the CPI, and the YSR Congress.“The detention is targeted as Telugu Desam followers are spared and only those belonging to the Left parties and the YSRC are being taken away putting a scare in the minds of those opposing bauxite mining the Agency area,” CPI (M) and CPI district secretaries K. Lokanadham and A.J. Stalin said at a press conference here. Paderu MLA Giddi Eswari said 18 persons were taken into custody and nine were later allowed to go.The three leaders said that the Girijans were in no way responsible for the murder of Venkata Ramana for which the Maoists had claimed responsibility. Ms. Eswari said she would move the Human Rights Council against the illegal detention of the Girijans.Mr. Lokanadham and Mr. Stalin pointed out that earlier the police harassed Girijans and registered false cases against them by branding them as Maoists for participating in the anti-bauxite mining agitation.Now the police are harassing the Girijans when Maoists killed an anti-bauxite mining activist. Due to the harassment and camps set up by the police, the Girijans could not go to the coffee plantations and other fields though it is the harvesting season.They demanded that the government withdraw GO 97, terminate all MoUs on bauxite mining and supply of ore, withdraw false cases against Girijans, and release all those in police custody to create a peaceful atmosphere in the Agency.
