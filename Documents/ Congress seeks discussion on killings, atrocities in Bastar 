The Congress on Friday boycotted the proceedings of the Chhattisgarh Assembly after its adjournment motion notice on atrocities on tribals in Bastar region and the deteriorating law and order situation there was rejected.The fourth day of the budget session witnessed uproar as the Congress sought discussion on the killing of villagers in Narayanpur district by Naxals and alleged gang-rapes by security forces in tribal pockets.The House was first adjourned for five minutes, and later the Congress boycotted the proceedings, not satisfied by the Home Minister’s reply.State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel who raised the issue said the BJP government appeared to be confused, lacking precise information. “Officials are giving different statements to media. Innocent villagers are bearing the brunt of both Naxals and the police. Tribal women are being raped.There is virtually no law and order in Bastar,” Mr. Baghel said.Revenue Minister Premprakash Pandey said that as a discussion on motion of thanks on Governor’s address was scheduled, no separate discussion was needed.Leader of opposition T. S. Singhdeo said the government could not confirm the number of deaths in Narayanpur. For the first time, the Principal Secretary of Home Department briefed the media (Thursday) but he too gave contradictory figures, Mr. Singhdeo said.Speaker Gaurishankar Agrawal rejected the adjournment motion notice saying enough time will be given for discussion on all these issues during the discussion on motion of thanks.-PTI
