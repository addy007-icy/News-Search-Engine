Elected ward members of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) will soon step out of their turf to campaign for the TRS during the GHMC elections.Sources in the Cantonment said that Excise Minister and Secunderabad MLA T. Padma Rao Goud, who is overseeing election efforts in Secunderabad, will task SCB ward members with campaigning effort in select GHMC wards around the Cantonment. The allocation of responsibility will depend on the connections and draw a ward member has in areas outside the Cantonment. “We will most likely be sent to wards in Alwal, Bowenpally, Yapral and other surrounding areas in the north of the city, where we can be recognized. We will work for the party, as it had worked for our election to the SCB,” said one ward member. Interestingly, SCB elections are required to be held on apolitical grounds, but most contestants flaunted political affiliations. Seven out of eight ward members in the present board are affiliated to the TRS. Party sources reveal that TRS may use SCB ward members in the GHMC wards around Cantonment and hard-sell its manifesto to an electorate that does not share TRS’s espousal of Telangana statehood.The Cantonment is surrounded by Malkajigiri, Qutubullapur and Kukatpally assembly constituencies. While some support from incumbent TRS Malkajigiri MLA Kanaka Reddy could aid the party’s efforts in wards of that constituency, the party might just find the Cantonment ward members handy in Qutubullapur and Kukatpally, which are TDP strongholds.Additionally, the Assembly constituency of Secunderabad Cantonment comprises the Cantonment, administered by the board, and some part of GHMC’s Marredpally ward. Cantonment MLA G. Sayanna, a former TDP man, joined the TRS last month, strengthening the party in his area.
