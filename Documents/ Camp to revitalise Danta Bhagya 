In order to revitalise Danta Bhagya — a scheme to provide dentures for poor old persons — the Health Department and Yenepoya Dental College will hold a dental check-up camp at the Government Wenlock Hospital on January 8.Talking to presspersons here on Monday, Ganesh Shenoy Panchmal, chairman of the State government’s Oral Health Policy Committee, said that the scheme had failed to reach many beneficiaries. Only 3,000 persons had got benefit of the scheme in six months, he said.Under the Dantabhagya scheme, a person aged above 60 holding a below poverty line card would be entitled for dentures for free. The State government had tied up with 46 private dental colleges, including six in Dakshina Kannada, for implementation of the scheme. Each college had been paid Rs. 50,000 for providing dentures. The government was spending Rs. 2 crore, Dr. Panchmal said.He said there were still many elderly persons who were not aware of this scheme.Dr. Panchmal was trying to involve Health Department personnel, public representatives and also the dental colleges staff in reaching out to the beneficiaries.On January 8, the beneficiaries would be screened by dentists at the Wenlock Hospital. Then they would be referred to the nearest private hospital for dentures.
