Doctors at a private hospital managed to save 14-year-old Aryan Katyal’s limb from amputation by performing a complex eight-hour-long surgery, giving him a new lease on life.“Aryan fractured his shoulder and injured the brachial plexus nerves in a motorcycle accident. While he was treated for the fracture, the injury to the nerves went undiagnosed. As a result, his right upper limb was completely paralysed and he was advised amputation due to severe pain,” said Dr. (Major General) A. S. Bath, Head of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery at BLK Super Speciality Hospital.The plexus of nerves connecting the neck to the upper limb are called brachial plexus. They can get stretched or injured during accidents, leading to partial or complete paralysis of the upper limb.Aryan lived with a paralysed limb for over five months before he sought help.“We decided to go in for nerve and tendon transfer surgeries simultaneously, which was very challenging. Three plastic surgeons performed an eight-hour-long microscopic surgery. In general, the results of such surgeries are dismal,” said a release by the hospital.However, Mr. Katyal’s regained hand movement just three months after the surgery, which took place in September-end. “He is back in school and writing with his right hand,” added Dr. Bath.
