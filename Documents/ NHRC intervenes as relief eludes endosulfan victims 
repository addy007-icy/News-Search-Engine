Taking cognizance of a report carried by The Hindu on January 18, ‘Relief eludes Kerala endosulfan victims,’ the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued notice to the Chief Secretary of Kerala and the District Collectors of Palakkad and Kasaragod asking why the relief ordered by the commission six years ago has not reached those affected.In an official release in New Delhi recently, the commission observed that the report raises ‘a serious issue of violation of right to the health of the victims.’ It sought detailed reports within two weeks.Observing that the Kerala government was bound to compensate and rehabilitate the victims, the commission recalled that the State government, in its order dated May 26, 2012, had notified that the recommendations of the NHRC were to be implemented and laid down the method by which the compensation was to be paid to various categories of the victims.“If the victims of endosulfan are not being compensated in terms of the order, it amounts to violation of their human rights. An unofficial survey has found that 613 children below the age of 14 continue to suffer from the illness caused by the aerial spraying of the pesticide in mango plantations of Muthalamada in Palakkad district. The newspaper report cites the case of a girl named Hemalatha, who, despite having born after two years of a global ban on the pesticide, suffers from physical illness because of the residuary effect of the pesticide,’’ the release said.The commission stressed the need for an expert study on the impact of endosulfan at Muthalamada, Velanthavalam, Vadakarapathi, Eruthempathy, Nenmara, and Nelliampathy panchayats of Palakkad.As per the earlier order of the commission, the State government was directed to pay at least Rs.5 lakh to the relatives of those who died because of the aerial spraying of the pesticide. An equal amount was promised to those who permanently bedridden and suffered from severe deformities.The NHRC ordered to pay at least Rs.3 lakh to all those who became living victims of the killer pesticide.
