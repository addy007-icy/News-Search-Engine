The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has abolished the five-day grace period given to employers for payment of provident fund in the wake of the facility offered to file electronic challan-cum-return and remittance of dues through internet banking.Employers are required to pay contributions and administrative charges within 15 days of the close of every month. A grace period of five days was also be allowed in addition to the statutory provisions to make the remittance.K. Prasant, Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, said here on Thursday that the grace period had been allowed following the practice of manual processing of calculation of wages and dues to the employees. The remittances of the dues in the bank also required additional time in the manual set-up. Recent technological advancement has empowered employers to compute wages and liabilities through aid of computers. This had substantially reduced the process and the time taken in calculation of Provident Fund dues and its remittances in bank, Mr. Prasant said.
