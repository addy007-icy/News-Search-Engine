As the Centre gears up to launch the National Biogas and Fertilizer Mission, alternative fuel from organic waste may make inroads into the homes in the urban pockets of the country.“Biogas is a clean energy option which has huge potential to emerge as a major alternative fuel, especially for cooking gas and power generation. As the biomass and wastes generated in big quantity is left unused, we aim to come out with technologies that can be adopted in homes for their energy needs,” said Varsha Joshi, Joint Director, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, New Delhi.Speaking at a session on biogas production and power generation at the 103rd Indian Science Congress here on Wednesday, she said the mission’s draft, with objectives and guidelines were being prepared. The mission aims to promote biogas initiatives in a big way across the country.Ms. Joshi said the MNRE would be scaling up its funding on the research and development on renewable energy, including biogas.Though the penetration of LPG in rural areas might have slowed down the biogas movement, the Ministry aims to touch millions of people with renewable energy technologies for providing clean energy options like biogas, she added.Ms. Joshi said biogas can create economic opportunities as the surplus energy can be sold, and improve living conditions of women in rural areas.However, there are certain issues which need to be looked at through innovations at various levels for improving their sustainability, she noted.“There are certain problems that can be overcome to help women in villages operate plants on their own. There are also issues for making the structures of the plants durable to prevent damage,” she explained.Ms. Joshi said the MNRE would invite new technologies and solutions from experts for making biogas a reliable fuel, especially in villages. “We want the best brains to come and help us with innovations and new applications, for making biogas a commercially viable option.”Ms. Joshi said the mission would help people innovate ideas for bringing down the cost of biogas plants.The Joint Director said there was a need for improving technologies and management for the effective use of biogas for decentralized power generation.The MNRE is promoting biogas projects for power generation in capacitiesof 3 kW to 250 kW Varsha JoshiJoint Director, MNRE, New Delhi
