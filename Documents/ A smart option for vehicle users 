or all those drivers who feel that every time they are stopped by the police or transport officials and asked to produce the relevant documents in their physical form, good news may be in store. They might just find it a hassle-free experience if they can show the digitised versions on their smart phones to the officers.The Transport department of Telangana has developed a mobile app that will allow smart phone users to scan and upload all their physical documents including Driving Licence, Registration and Pollution-Under-Check Certificate, permits in the case of commercial vehicles and the like. Once this is done, they just need to show the enforcement officials of the Transport department or the police as the case may be and get going in a jiffy, with nary an argument.“It may probably be called e-Wallet or better still, m-Wallet. We have not yet named it but have already started making the app available to the police so that they could check the digitised documents shown to them on the smart phone if they suspect that the details could be fabricated or wrong,” Transport Commissioner-Telangana, Sandeep Kumar Sultania told The Hindu on Monday. “If everything goes on schedule, we might be up and running with this service within 30 to 45 days,” he declared.Asked about who had developed the app, he said that they had probably saved a few crores of rupees for the exchequer by not entrusting the entire job of developing and testing the app. “We just used a few consultants for specific freelance jobs by spending a few lakhs,” he explained.As to how many police personnel will have access and till what rank of officers, Mr. Sultania said it did not matter. “We can give it to as many as senior police officers decide and request accordingly. I am confident that this initiative will narrow the gap between the government and the governed. That is the ultimate objective,” the Transport Commissioner said, signing off.We might be up and running with this service within 30 to 45 days.Sandeep Kumar SultaniaTransport Commissioner
