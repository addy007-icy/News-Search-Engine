In the wake of the death of three college students in Villupuram district, which is mired in a controversy, DMK president M. Karunanidhi called upon the student community not to resort to the extreme step of taking their lives. In an appeal to students, he said, “My dear students, you have your parents, family, brothers and sisters with you and not only this country. They are hoping that you would look after them after completing your studies. Please do not crush their hopes.” Though a student’s life is filled with emotions, they should not forget their parents and should not take the extreme step, the DMK chief appealed.Recalling his meeting with the parent of one of the three girls, to whom the party’s Tiruvarur district unit gave Rs. 1 lakh on Wednesday, Mr. Karunanidhi called upon the students to focus on studies and ensure that no student took the extreme step henceforth.Listing out incidents in Tamil Nadu, in which students had allegedly died of suicide, he quoted Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani, who in her written reply to Parliament, had stated that a total of 8,068 students had committed suicide in 2014 and Tamil Nadu stood second with 853 cases.
