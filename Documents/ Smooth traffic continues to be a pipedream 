Though the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) collects a hefty toll at the Surathkal NITK plaza on National Highway 66, the roads are not in good condition and the entry and exit from Mangaluru towards Udupi side are choked.Stretches of the service road at Kottara and NH 66 between Kulur Bridge and Kulur flyover (towards Mangaluru) are examples for the NHAI apathy in ensuring good and motorable roads.It has been more than a fortnight that the NHAI had dug up the service road which was perennially in an awful state near the Kottara flyover for another round of repair.While the work goes on at a snailâ€™s pace, the traffic from the city towards Udupi is diverted on the other side of the flyover, on the carriageway meant for traffic moving towards the city and Nanthoor.As a result, traffic snarls have become the order of the day near Kottara Chowki.Motorists from the city, joining the regular carriageway of NH 66 just after the flyover, are at the risk of being hit by speeding vehicles coming from Nanthoor, said Rajgopal Shetty, driver of a mini-commercial vehicle.On the other hand, about 200m of the carriageway of NH 66 towards the city from Udupi, between Kulur Bridge and Kulur Flyover, is in a bad state for many months. The stretch thus slows down movement of vehicles; heavy goods vehicles move cautiously so as not to get their axles damaged thereby affecting vehicular movement.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) Sanjeev M. Patil told The Hindu that the Commissioner of Police has already warned NHAI to complete the works expeditiously. He said the incomplete works have considerably affecting smooth vehicular movement.
