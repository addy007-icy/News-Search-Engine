Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Mohan Kundariya here on Thursday said the NDA government considered Odisha government’s demand for drought assistance more positively than previous UPA government.“Odisha was hardly given five per cent of total calamity assistance demanded in memorandum by the State government during UPA regime. However, NDA provided over Rs. 800 crore as against the demand of Rs. 2200 crore of drought assistance this year,” said Mr. Kundariya hitting out at the Congress at a press conference here on Thursday.Unlike UPA government, the NDA government was also quick to release drought assistance to Odisha, he said.The minister said the Narendra Modi government was aware of farmers’ plight in the era of climate change.“We have come up with new crop insurance scheme in which farmers will be compensated for the climate change-induced damages. Farmers will also not have to pay higher amount for insurance premium,” Mr. Kundariya said.He pointed out, “farmers will pay 2 per cent of crop insurance as premium for Khariff crop while 1.5 per cent for rabi crop. During the time of payment of compensation, 25 per cent of assistance would be immediately deposited in farmer’s account. And rest 75 per cent would be paid after completion of process.”
