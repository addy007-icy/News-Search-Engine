Dinesh Amin Mattu, senior journalist and media adviser to the Chief Minister, has said that concerted attempts are being made by Sangh Parivar organisations to suppress multicultural practices in the country and impose “uni-cultural practices” with an ulterior motive to decimate the culture of minority communities.He was here on Sunday to inaugurate a seminar on Sufi philosophy and its contribution to the enrichment of folklore. It was organised by the Karnataka Janapada Academy.Mr. Mattu said that while “uniculture” promotes the culture of one particular community or religion, multicultural practices allow the thriving of all cultural practices. He said that another dangerous trend followed by the Sangh Parivar organisations was to use the various forms of folk arts to espouse their political opinions and to impose “unicultural practices”.Mr. Mattu said that Sangh Parivar organisations were now targeting tribals through their Vanvasi Kalyan Ashrams to spread Hindutva ideology. The people should be wary of these designs and defeat them, he said.Mr. Mattu said that the teachings of Buddha and Basaveshwara were not limited to any one particular section of society, but was relevant to all, irrespective of their religion and caste. He said that the Sangh Parivar organisations, which had criticised the ideology of B.R. Ambedkar and Periyar Ramaswamy in the past had made them as their icon for meeting their political ends.Mr. Mattu said that folk artists should protect the originality of folklore and its culture without allowing it to get polluted by political influences. Chairman of the Karnataka Janapada Academy Pichalli Srinivas, Syed Shaha Taqhveullah of Khaja Banda Nawaz Darga and Meenakshi Bali were present.‘Sangh Parivar using folk arts to espousetheir political opinions’
