Ramanath Rai said that the government has earmarked Rs. 2 crore for widening the 2-km stretch between Melkar and Marnabail of the national highway. The work to widen the first 500 meters will start on Tuesday.Mr. Ramanath Rai sought cooperation from all departments and the people for widening the national highway stretch to four lanes.Mr. Ramanath Rai said that the National Highway division of the Public Works Department will be undertaking the widening work and hand it over to the National Highway Authority of India that will take it forward. The Public Works Department officials have been asked to earmark the portion of land required for four-laning and also the service road. Then, the available land will be asphalted.Mr. Ramanath Rai said that as a part of junction improvement work, bus bays and bus shelters will be created.
