Just over a fortnight after it took over the physical incubation space at Startup Village, the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has embarked on a slew of measures to streamline the functioning of the telecom incubator.To begin with, the operational hours of the government-run facility stands regulated from the New Year onwards. The incubator, which remained open round-the-clock previously, will now be accessible between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.“Entrepreneurship is a serious affair and it has to be approached as such. It calls for a certain level of discipline and the regulation of the operational time is a step in that direction. Besides, running the facility involves considerable cost and hence cannot be kept open all the time,” said Jayasankar Prasad C., CEO of KSUM (previously known as Technopark-TBI).He said all 40 start-ups except for a couple have agreed to the new arrangement. Extension of working hours for completion of work would be considered on a case-by-case basis. But, a work culture where daytime is wasted so as to work during night hours alone would not be allowed.Besides, access has been strictly regulated. Start-ups functioning out of the facility will have to enter into an agreement and only their authorised members will be allowed access. Guests may be brought in after signing in the guest book.“There will be monthly reviews to weed out units not serious about the work and meet targets. This will help direct promising ones towards correct mentors. We have been successfully implementing such a system at the Technopark-TBI in Thiruvananthapuram for more than a year,” Mr. Prasad said.Surveillance cameras will also be mounted in the working space shortly. The footage will serve as a reference point in the event an issue takes place.The Kerala Startup Mission wants to streamline the functioning of the telecom incubator.
