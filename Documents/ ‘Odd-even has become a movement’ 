: Taking a lead from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who labelled his government’s odd-even vehicle-rationing experiment a success just three hours after it was rolled out on Friday, Transport Minister Gopal Rai interpreted the average Delhi driver's adherence to its provisions as a “behavioural change” that it had aimed to affect in the first place.“We thank people of Delhi for making the scheme a success on the first day. The same Delhi, which was called selfish, has shown the way. We thank all people for choosing their kids' health,” Mr. Rai said at a press conference equating the response it generated among the people of Delhi to their support for the Aam Aadmi Party-triggered movement against corruption three years ago.“That time people of Delhi wanted a corruption-free city. Now they want a pollution-free city,” the Transport Minister, who boarded a DTC bus to assess the implementation of the scheme on the ground, said.Nodal anti-pollution and Health Minister Satyender Jain said a political party which ruled Delhi in the past only talked about the odd-even scheme but did not have the guts to implement it.“No political party had guts to implement the odd-even policy. This is the first government, which has taken this step to clear Delhi’s polluted air for our children,” Mr. Jain said.Claiming that the evident support for the move was arguably the first instance of a government policy transforming into a mass public movement, Mr. Rai also urged the BJP-led Centre to extend its support to it given the lack of alternatives both they and the AAP government faced in terms of fighting pollution.“This is not a fight between the AAP and the BJP or between Delhi and the Centre. This fight is against pollution and I appeal to the BJP and the Congress to come out and support this drive and make it a great success,” he said.
