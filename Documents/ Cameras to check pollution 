Cameras will be installed at the point where water from Haryana enters the Capital and laboratories of the Delhi Jal Board strengthened in order to prevent pollution from hitting the supply.Over the past week, water supply to large parts of the Capital has been hit as high levels of ammonia have been found in the raw water.The Wazirabad and Chandrawal treatment plants were operating at half their capacities till late on Friday evening, when ammonia levels fell and the plants started functioning fully.The supply across the city will be normal by Saturday morning, said DJB chairperson Kapil Mishra, who had an emergency meeting with officials on Friday evening.“Our supply gets hit every time Haryana releases industrial pollutants in our raw water source. We have now decided to come up with a permanent solution within a month so that this does not happen from the summer,” said Mr. Mishra.
