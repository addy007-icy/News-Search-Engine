Industrialists and shopkeepers have expressed serious concern over the alleged failure of the National Highways Authority of India to make provision to restore greenery on NH-4A of Goaves Circle to Peeranwadi Cross.They urged Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram to direct the NHAI to restore greenery on both sides of the road, which was presently being widened into a six-lane highway. A large number of trees had been uprooted to facilitate road widening.The district administration and Forest Department officials had promised to plant new trees, but no sapling had been planted so far.Representatives Deepak Aversekar and Vinayak Kawale said the city was losing its greenery owing to various developmental works like road widening, laying of underground electricity cable, and ongoing expansion. Evidently, the temperatures were at higher level even during monsoon, and the pollution level was bound to rise owing to loss of greenery.
