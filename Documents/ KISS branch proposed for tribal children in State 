An institute to provide education to tribal children of Karnataka on the outskirts of Bengaluru has been proposed by Achyuta Samanta, founder of Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), which provides free education from kindergarten to post-graduation to tribals in Bhubaneswar.Dr. Samanta, who has been elected president of the 105th Indian Science Congress to be held in 2018, told The Hindu: “We have been aspiring for the last three years to set up a branch of KISS in Karnataka, preferably on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Since it will be a free and residential institute, there was no need to open a branch in forest areas or tribal areas, where it will not be possible to provide exposure and quality education.”KISS opened a branch in Delhi and though the government sanctioned an intake of 1,200, about 500 students have enrolled.Simliar efforts to establish an institute are under under way in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra.Dr. Samanta said the branches of KISS in other States will have to be supported by the government or corporate sector. “We have been approaching persons from the corporate and industrial sector to support this noble cause,” he said.Pointing out that education was the real solution to social problems, Dr. Samanta said KISS was helping check Maoism in Orissa.
