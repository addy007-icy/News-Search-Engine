A four-year-old girl was found murdered inside a field at Kowlpalayam near here on Monday.The police suspected her mother A. Mallika (22) as she did not show any sign of grief over her daughterâ€™s death. She confessed to have committed the murder during interrogation. So she was arrested on Tuesday. She told the police that her daughter had seen her with a man with whom she was said to have had illicit intimacy. Fearing that the girl would convey the affair to her father Annadurai, who was working as a labourer in Rajasthan, Mallika took her daughter to a farm and allegedly strangulated her to death. The woman returned home and thereafter went in search of the girl along with some locals.
