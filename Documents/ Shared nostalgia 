I fully agree with the author of “The pleasures of restraint” (Urbanscape, Jan.07) that we need cleaner, more democratic and happier cities rather than smart ones. The Aam Aadmi Party deserves kudos for the odd/even rule experiment to reduce traffic jams and air pollution in our national capital. There is need to restore footpaths for use by pedestrians, and hawkers should not be allowed to encroach at any cost. Cycle lanes need to be demarcated for covering distances of up to 15 km. Strengthening public transport and incentivising its use is necessary to reduce the number of private automobiles on the roads.Car-free days along the lines of the Bogota model can be introduced. Government officials in the highest cadre and political leaders the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers and other Ministers should make it a point to travel on car-free days by public transport to share the experience with the common man. In a country with millions of poor people, the car-owning people cannot be given the freedom to pollute the air. Quality transport and clean air needs to be made available to all, not just to the rich people.M.V. Nagavender Rao,Hyderabad
