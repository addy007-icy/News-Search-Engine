The problem of sewage overflow, not new to streets off Santhome High Road, have been more stubborn following the floods.Residents say how persistent sewage overflows have led to insalubrious conditions in the locality.R. Vanaja, a resident of Periyapalli Street, says, “We are unable to walk on the road. We are experiencing a sewage overflow, at least once in two months.”Natrajan, a resident of a neighbourhood near Adyar Poonga, says, “A few days ago, sewage remained stagnant on our street. The place is becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It is becoming a regular feature in our colony.”Natrajan recalls a particularly messy instance of a sewage overflow, which occurred two years ago. “Sewage remained stagnant for nine months. We had to wade through the sewage. Santhome High Road is a key stretch as vehicles of VIPs pass through it and it is also an important bus route. So, officials were reluctant to dig up the road. After frequent complaints and several visits to the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, the work was taken up. “Though workers come and clear the clog, the menace has been occurring often in recent times. A lasting solution to this problem is replacement of sewer pipelines. The existing pipelines were laid decades ago. The capacity was meant to cater to individual houses. However, since late 1990s, many high-rises have come up in MRC Nagar and Santhome,” says Natrajan.
