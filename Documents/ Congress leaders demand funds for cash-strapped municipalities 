A delegation of Congress councillors and leaders on Wednesday met Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung to demand his intervention in the municipalities’ long-standing demand for funds from the Delhi government.The three Bharatiya Janata Party-run municipal corporations are facing a financial crisis, and have been demanding that the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government implement the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission, which give the civic bodies a bigger share of taxes.The Congress leaders said that their party’s government had given the municipalities grants whenever they needed help in the past.They told the Lieutenant-Governor that the financial condition of the corporations was so bad now that salaries had not been paid for month and employees have been forced to protest.Mr. Jung promised the Congress delegation that he would take up the matter with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Among those who met the Lieutenant-Governor were the leaders of Opposition in the North, East and South corporations, Mukesh Goel, Varyam Kaur and Farhad Suri.Mr. Goel said: “Whether it is the AAP or the BJP that is responsible for this crisis, the fact of the matter is that our employees, pensioners and the average Delhiites are suffering.”
