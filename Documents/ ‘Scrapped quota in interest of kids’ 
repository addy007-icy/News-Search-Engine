Defending its decision to scrap quotas for private school admissions, the AAP government told the Delhi High Court that this was done to check “unfair and exploitative criteria”. The Delhi government said it was their duty to “ensure that admissions are open to all without any discrimination based on religion, caste, race and place of birth”. This was stated in an affidavit filed by the Department of Education, which also said the pleas seeking quashing of the government’s order scrapping 62 criteria, including management quota, for nursery admissions is “misconceived”.
