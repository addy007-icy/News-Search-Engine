The Childrenâ€™s Science Exhibition, being held as part of the Indian Science Congress, has brought to the fore latent creativity.A safety transport bus conceived by T. Apoorva, a class 10 student of Prashanthi Vidya Kendra, Kasaragod, Kerala, has caught the imagination of visitors. Even the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation authorities have evinced interest in her project.Ms. Apoorva told The Hindu that the objective of the project was to minimise the risk of death of passengers during accidents, especially fire, and ensure safety and advanced transportation technology.Bus accidents involving fire are common. Since they have only one entry door, it becomes difficult to rescue those trapped inside. Hence, the safety bus has been conceived and designed so that the body panel opens on all sides in case of accidents.The model bus is also fitted with fire sensor and has other safety features, she said.Ms. Apoorva spent about 18 to 20 hours on it.
