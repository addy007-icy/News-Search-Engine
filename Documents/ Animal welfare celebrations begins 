Joint Director of Animal Husbandry Department, K. Gabriel on Thursday inaugurated the fortnight-long animal welfare celebrations on the premises of the Society for the Prevention of Society to the Animals (SPCA) here. He also inaugurated the dispensary and shelter for the animals. Addressing a meeting presided by the vice-president of the SPCA P. Raghu Rama Rao, Dr. Gabriel said that though the government had enforced several Acts to prevent cruelty against animals, cruel practices were still going on. “Unless there is a change in the attitude of people, we can’t expect the cruelty to be stopped,” he said.
