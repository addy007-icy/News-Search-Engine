Videographers from various television channels had occupied the fourth row at the venue. Some were sitting on raised platforms while others stood on chairs. After the first play, the impatient audience had a tiff with the videographers, which led to minor pushing and shoving. “Media go back” slogans were heard from the audience. Later, the organisers requested all of the videographers to move to either side, an announcement which was met with loud cheers from the audience.Confusion over the results of the mono act competition held at the Government GHSS Cotton Hill threatened to disrupt the Chavittu Nadakam competition that began later. An error that crept in data entry resulted in the families of two participants crowding backstage and demanding that the issue be sorted out at the earliest.As many as six contestants in the Mappilapaattu HSS (girls) event had taken part in reality shows.
