TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu will hit the campaign trail in support of the TDP-BJP nominees of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation on Jan 28.According to tentative schedule, Mr. Naidu will conduct road shows in different areas, particularly the areas where the population of residents of AP origin is more. Accordingly, he is expected to conduct road shows in Jubilee Hills, Kukatpally, Serilingampally, Patancheru and other areas on January 28. The TDP president would interact with electorate in Malkajgiri, Uppal, L.B. Nagar, Saroornagar and adjacent areas on January 29 seeking their support for the victory of the alliance’s candidates. He is expected to highlight the contribution made by the previous TDP government for the development of Hyderabad as also the creation of Cyberabad, which houses the IT establishment.The TDP president’s campaign, according to party sources, would focus on the failure of the State Government to ensure proper maintenance of basic amenities like roads and drinking water to the residents as a result of which an acute drinking water crisis is facing the city in the ensuing summer. He is likely to elaborate on the TDP’s road map to mitigate the problems if the alliance was voted to power.Meanwhile, Mr. Naidu’s son and TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh continued his campaign for the alliance’s candidates on Tuesday. He launched tirade against the TRS government for hoodwinking the people with its false promises and recalled how Mr. Naidu strove for putting the city in the global map as an investment destination.
