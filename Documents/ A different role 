It’s usually difficult to distinguish known faces when 28 teams of 10 members each perform on stage. But the Vanchipaattu contest here on Monday had one face that was easily recognisable — that of Malavika Nair, who has twice won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Child Artiste for her roles in Karutha Pakshigal and Oomakuyil Padumbol .Malavika who was presenting Ramapurathu Warrier’s Kuchela Vritham in the Aranmula style said the competition was tough. The Plus One student said she wanted to take part in an event that was not perceived to be popular. “Vanchipattu is performed only in some places. Moreover, I had never heard it or sung it before.”
