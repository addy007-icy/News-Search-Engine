Frequent accidents are reported from certain sections of the western and northern suburban railway lines. T. Sadagopan, activist from Pattabhiram, said the section between Avadi and Thiruninravur was extremely dangerous. “These lines have only a few subways and foot overbridges. Commuters often have no choice but to cross the tracks.” Railway officials also discovered that a number of victims were school and college students who cross the track while speaking or listening to music on their mobile phones.The stretch near Guduvanchery railway station is another high-risk zone as several hundred commuters take a short cut to cross the track. Immediate measures should be provided before permanent solutions are found, residents said. Peerkankaranai town panchayat chairman A.V. Sampathkumar said they had requested railway officials that at least a temporary foot overbridge across Perungalathur railway station be provided.
