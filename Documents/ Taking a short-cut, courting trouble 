A portion of the wall constructed along Station Border Road in West Mambalam was broken down a month ago. This was done to allow floodwater to flow out of the inundated subway nearby. But, the wall remains unconstructed. Now, the damaged wall has given people a ‘short-cut’ to reach T. Nagar, which is on the other side of the track. Railway commuters and pedestrians can be seen jumping over the wall and crossing the tracks to reach the other side. A block of stone has been placed in front of the broken portion to make it easy for people to climb and cross over what remains of the wall.“The wall had been re-constructed after repeated requests from the public a few years ago. The old wall was dilapidated and broken in places. Back then, people used to slip through and cross the tracks. Many lost their lives after being hit by trains. Now again, the small gap is encouraging people to cross the tracks instead of taking the subway. Also, the wall on the T. Nagar side has been similarly damaged. Though this measure had to be taken during the floods, I don’t understand why it was not patched up immediately,” says R. Govindraj, resident of West Mambalam.Muthu, an auto driver who operates from a stand near the location, says even elderly women are taking such risks. “I asked one women to take the subway, but she said she had leg pain and would not be able to take the stairs on the subway. Also, a stone has been placed there to help people conveniently jump over the wall. It must be rebuilt before a fatal accident occurs,” he says.The broken wall is only a few feet away from the railway track and anyone trying to cross would have to immediately land on it.
