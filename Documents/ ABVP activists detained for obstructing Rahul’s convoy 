Seventeen activists of the Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) were taken into preventive custody when they tried to obstruct the convoy of Congress party vice-president Rahul Gandhi at Begumpet on Tuesday.Accompanied by Telangana State Congress leaders Uttam Kumar Reddy, Mr. Gandhi started for University of Hyderabad at Gachibowli to speak to students agitating over the suicide of research scholar Vemula Rohith, after landing at Begumpet airport.As the convoy of vehicles reached Prakashnagar ‘T’ junction beneath the flyover, a group of ABVP workers emerged from bylanes and ran across the vehicles holding posters condemning Mr. Gandhi’s visit to the UoH. Policemen deployed along the road rushed towards them and pulled them aside, but it took a few seconds for them to clear the road.The detained students were shifted to the police station and later released.A separate case was registered against three other ABVP workers who allegedly smashed windscreen of a private car. They are, however, yet to be arrested, Begumpet Inspector G. Baswa Reddy said.
