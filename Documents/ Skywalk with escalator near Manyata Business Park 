Crossing the busy Outer Ring Road near Embassy Manyata Business Park may soon become hassle free. On Sunday, the main bridge for the skywalk with escalator was erected outside the business park. The construction is expected to be completed by May 2016. According to a communiqué, the ground breaking for the skywalk was done in November 2015 after the design for the project was approved by various civic agencies, including BDA and BBMP. The project has been funded by the Embassy Group, a real estate developer. The communiqué added that the skywalk outside the business park will provide relief to the communities that live and work in and around the business park.
