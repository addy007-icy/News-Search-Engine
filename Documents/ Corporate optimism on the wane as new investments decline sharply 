Industry’s optimism about the investment climate has waned due to a sharp recent decline in the value of new project announcements, which in the December 2015 quarter fell to one-fourth of their levels the previous year, data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows.New projects worth Rs. one lakh crore were announced in the December 2015 quarter, down from Rs. four lakh crore in December 2014. New project announcements were at Rs.8.2 lakh crore in calendar year 2015 as compared to Rs.9.4 lakh crore in 2014.At the same time, the data shows that the value of stalled projects fell to Rs.1,723.2 crore in the December 2015 quarter, down from Rs.86,177.3 crore in the same quarter the previous year.Stressed assets“I understand that the stock of stressed assets come in five different buckets — specific permissions, sectoral issues, market-related postponements, promoter funding issues, and those that are abandoned.It would be interesting to find from the official statistics in which specific bucket the reduction have occurred,” Vinayak Chatterjee, Chairman, Feedback Infrastructure Services told The Hindu.The electronic machinery sector accounted for 26 per cent of all new project announcements by value in the December 2015 quarter, while the electricity generation sector accounted for 20 per cent and the transport equipment accounted for 10 per cent.The CMIE data shows that while the value of stalled projects has fallen drastically year-on-year, the value of shelved projects — those in which investment has been deferred in the medium term — has increased by 72.4 per cent to Rs.4,704.7 crore in the December 2015 quarter over the previous year.Abandoned projectsSimilarly, the value of abandoned projects, those that will not see the light of day, increased by 19 per cent to Rs.1.9 lakh crore in January-December 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Notably, two sectors — storage and distribution, and road transport infrastructure services — made up nearly 60 per cent of the stalled, shelved and abandoned projects in the December 2015 quarter.“While some stalled projects have got moving, the projects being shelved or abandoned is an important reason by the number of stalled projects has reduced so much,” an economist tracking the infrastructure sector said on the condition of anonymity.
