Work on the construction of the bus stand at Viralimalai is yet to be completed. The work was taken up in February 2014 and was scheduled to be completed by September 2015.Although the civil work relating to the construction of bus bays, shopping complex, and toilet blocks had been completed, a few finishing works such as provision of road facility and water supply were yet to be completed.Viralimalai, a village panchayat, has been declared a heritage town by the State government by virtue of its popularity for an ancient temple atop a hillock dedicated to Lord Subramanyar.Realising the need for provision of bus stand facility, the State government sanctioned the facility at an estimate of Rs. 1.80 crore under the “Scheme Component Pooled Assigned Revenue” scheme of the Rural Development Department.It has been built on an area of 10,000 sq. metres on a piece of land belonging to the village panchayat close to the Viralimalai–Tiruchi Road. It has 10 bus bays, 12 shops on a plinth area of 816 square metres.Official sources said that the work would be resumed shortly and completed.
