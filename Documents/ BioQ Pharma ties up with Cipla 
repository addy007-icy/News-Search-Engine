California based BioQ Pharma Inc. has signed a distribution, supply and development agreement with pharmaceutical major Cipla Ltd for registration and commercialisation of its Ropivacaine infusion pharmaceutical in India.BioQ Pharma is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of single-use, large volume and ready-to-use infusible pharmaceuticals.Its unit-dose infusion pharmaceuticals have been developed as ready-to-use presentations in which the drugs and administration systems are self-contained and delivered at the point of care.In particular, the Ropivacaine infusion system is pre-filled, ready to use at the point of care, and intended to provide a safer, more efficient continuous-infusion post-operative pain solution, the company said in a statement.“We believe India is an excellent market to help expand our objective of establishing a new standard of care in the presentation and administration of infusible pharmaceuticals,” Josh Kriesel, President and CEO of BioQ Pharma said in a statement.“Cipla's proven, hospital-focused sales and marketing organisation will be essential in introducing BioQ Pharma’s proprietary unit-dose, large volume infusion pharmaceuticals to India’s healthcare market, which we believe will benefit from our product’s value-add proposition of increased safety, sterility and convenience,” he added.Nikhil Chopra, Head of Cipla’s India Business said, “We believe that this innovative product represents a significant evolution in enhancing the delivery of infusions and managing post-surgical pain.”Cipla shares closed with a gain of 1.75 per cent at Rs 652.40 on the BSE.
