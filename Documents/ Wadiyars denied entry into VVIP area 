MYSURU: Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, wife of the late Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, and Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, the recently anointed scion of the Mysuru royal family, were stopped by the Special Protection Group (SPG) from entering the VVIP area on Manasagangotri campus on Sunday.Ms. Wadiyar and Mr. Yaduveer were initially directed towards the VVIP area. But the SPG personnel, who were manning the entrance, denied entry to them and they were later escorted by the university staff to the VIP seating area, outside the sterile zone.A minor stir was created when a member of the public shouted at the organisers for “showing disrespect” to the royal family members. “They are members of the royal family and it is an insult to make them sit with the common people,” he shouted.Meanwhile, officials said that Ms. Wadiyar and Mr. Yaduveer’s names were not mentioned in the list submitted to the SPG, which controls entry into the sterile areas.However, Ms. Wadiyar and Mr. Yaduveer had met Mr. Modi earlier in the day at Lalitha Mahal Palace Hotel, where he stayed overnight.
