The ongoing visit of the French President, François Hollande (“Modi, Hollande set the stage for counter-terror cooperation”, Jan.25) will surely lead to an uptick in India-France relations for several reasons. First, both countries have agreed to take steps to counter the spread of terrorism and the Islamic State and enhance counter-terror cooperation. Since both countries are founding members of the International Solar Alliance, one hopes that it gives them the opportunity to promote clean and renewable sources of energy. Moves are also expected to be made to increase collaboration in the sectors of space and nuclear power. Finally, any forward movement on the Rafale deal will be a win-win for both sides.Akshay Viswanathan,ThiruvananthapuramOne hopes that India-France ties are not totally linked to the fate of the Rafale deal. The meeting of the heads of the two countries should extend the boundaries of the production/consumption frontier of India and France and ensure growth with peace. After all, Republic Day does not end with the unfurling of flags, march pasts and cultural programmes. It is imperative that the two countries march ahead in all areas and ensure growth for which concrete actions are important.S. Ramakrishnasayee,Ranipet, Tamil Nadu
