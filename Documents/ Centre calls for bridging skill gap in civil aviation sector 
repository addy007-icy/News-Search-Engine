Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju raised concerns over the tremendous mismatch between the skills required for the civil aviation sector and the availability of suitable manpower.The minister was speaking at a conference on Monday to discuss a draft report submitted by ICRA Management Consultancy Services Ltd. (IMaCS) on skill gaps in the civil aviation sector, the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.Mr. Raju added that stakeholders should come together to work out ways for skill development, taking into consideration the requirements and employment opportunities available in all segments of the civil aviation sector including Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) and cargo, both within and outside the country.In its draft report, IMaCS has recommended setting up a National Civil Aviation Training Authority and Cargo and Ground Handling Sector Skill Council, the Ministry of Civil Aviation added.“The draft report prepared by IMaCS has identified possible skill requirements across aviation segments like airport, airline, MRO (maintenance, repair and operations), cargo and ground handling,” the civil aviation ministry said.Other recommendations included building a robust fund mechanism for training, creating infrastructure and improving training process.
