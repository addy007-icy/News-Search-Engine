The Lok Satta will contest 35 wards, CPI (M) 33, CPI 22, Communist Party of India (Marxists) 2 and some other organisations a few remaining wards, in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the banner ‘One Hyderabad’. The alliance with the theme of ‘Clean Politics’ and ‘Common Minimum Programme’ as the agenda, will focus on making the city liveable. Though ideologically different, what brought the parties together was their common agenda to focus on local issues in the polls and encourage people to vote for candidates on merit , sources said.
