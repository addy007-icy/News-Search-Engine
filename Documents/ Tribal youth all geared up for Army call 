In pursuit of their ambition to join the Indian Army, as many as 297 tribal youths of the district are presently undergoing rigorous training at the pre-Army recruitment training camp being organised by the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) in Bhadrachalam.The 40-day free residential training camp for the tribal youths began at the Youth Training Centre (YTC) at the ITDA office premises on December 28 last year. The ITDA has initiated the training camp to help the eligible tribal youths undergo free training and emerge triumphant in the Army recruitment rally to be held in Kothagudem next month.The ITDAâ€™s similar initiatives helped several unemployed tribal youths secure jobs in police and para-military forces a couple of years ago.Around 290 of the total 400 tribal youths trained by the ITDA had secured jobs in the Sattupalli-based 15th Special Police Battalion over nine years ago, the ITDA sources said.Tribal youths from both the plain and the Agency areas of the district are presently undergoing training in the free residential training camp in Bhadrachalam, says V. Prasad, Principal, YTC, ITDA, Bhadrachalam.Apart from the training in theory covering general knowledge, current affairs and logical reasoning, physical training is also being imparted to the trainees under the aegis of a team of Physical Education Directors, he notes, adding that the pre-Army recruitment training camp will continue up to February 5.
