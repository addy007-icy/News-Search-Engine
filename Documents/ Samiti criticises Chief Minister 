H. Hanumanthappa, president of the Karnataka State Madiga Meesalati Horata Samiti, criticised Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for dilly-dallying over taking a decision on implementing the Justice A.J. Sadashiva Commission report on providing internal reservation to Scheduled Castes.Speaking to press persons here on Saturday, Mr. Hanumanthappa charged Mr. Siddaramaiah with shifting his stand after becoming the Chief Minister of the State. “As the then leader of Opposition, Mr. Siddaramaiah had vociferously condemned the lathi charge on the Dalits who had gathered in front of Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi, seeking internal reservation. After becoming Chief Minister, Mr. Siddaramaiah has been dilly dallying over taking a decision in the matter,” he said.Mr. Hanumanthappa also took a dig at the four Ministers representing Dalits – G. Parameshwara, Srinivas Prasad, H.C. Mahadevappa and H. Anjaneya – for not mounting pressure on the Chief Minister to implement the report.
