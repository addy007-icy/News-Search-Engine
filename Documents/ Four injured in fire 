Four persons sustained burns in a fire that broke out in the parking lot of an under-construction building in South-East Delhi’s Jangpura on Wednesday morning.Though the cause is suspected to be a short circuit, the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. A probe has been ordered, said a senior police officer. While three of the victims were discharged after treatment, the fourth is said to be in a serious condition at the burns unit of Safdarjung Hospital. Jai Prakash, 35, has sustained over 80 per cent burns.The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. when the labourers working were alerted by a blast in the vicinity. While most of them managed to rush out, the four victims were trapped inside as the blast led to a blaze that spread quickly because of electrical and other items stashed inside, said a senior fire officer.Eight fire fighters rushed to the spot after they received a call at 9.44 am. They doused the flames within 15 minutes and rescued the victims, the officer said. “The victims had fallen unconscious possibly because of the smoke. They were rescued from the building, brought to their senses and rushed to Safdarjung Hospital.Three of these labourers, Ram Prasad Rai, 45, Ram Prakash, 20, and 35-year-old Anil Chhotu suffered relatively minor burns. Jai Prakash continues to be in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is in a critical state. The blast, meanwhile, is believed to be triggered by some chemicals stored inside the building, apparently to be used for construction.
