The Udupi District Contractors Association has urged the authorities to release pending dues of Rs. 12 crore to the contractors.Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Patla Annayya Nayak, general secretary of the association, said that bills of Rs. 12 crore of various works were pending for about a year.All the members of the association were small contractors, who took up small or minor works. Hence, a delay in payment affected them.Last summer, the contractors had completed rural drinking water works despite non-payment of bills as they did not want people to suffer. Even this money had not been released.If the authorities did not release the pending amount, the association would have no other alternative but to stage a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office on January 15.‘Appoint more staff’The government should appoint more to staff to the sub-divisions set up in taluk headquarters to oversee the works, Mr. Nayak said.Association says bills ofRs. 12 crore was pending forabout a year
