A Dalit IAS official on Monday alleged that the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta had registered cases against him with the “ill-intention” of harassing him, and threatened to end his life going on a fast if the government acted against him. “I will end my life by giving up food and water,” said Ramesh Thete, addressing a meeting of Dalit-Adivasi Forum, Madhya Pradesh.“Just because I am a Dalit, I have been targeted since 2002. In the last 10 years, I have faced 10 cases and in nine of these I was given a clean chit,” Mr Thete said.Lokayukta had registered a case against him suo motu when he was an Additional Commissioner in Ujjain.“It was alleged that I have freed the land of farmers from Ceiling Act, causing a huge loss to the government. In similar matters against higher caste officials, no cases were registered by the ombudsman despite the fact they also acted in the same fashion,” he claimed.Lokayukta had given clean chit to several ‘dishonest’ officials and Ministers while he was being targeted because he is a Dalit, he said.Lokayukta officials could not be contacted for comments.The Convener of the Forum, Mohanlal Patil, said: “BJP, which considers itself champion of Hindus, is not behaving in a just manner with Dalits and tribals because of which a Dalit IAS officer in Rajasthan (Umrao Salodia) embraced Islam.”Shashi Karnwat, a woman Dalit IAS officer, who is under suspension in a case, also spoke. -- PTI
