Honoured by two Indian Presidents, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Pranab Mukharjee, for the design of Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology and as the recipient of National Energy Conservation Award respectively, celebrated architect N. Mahesh recently accomplished forty glorious years of his architectural odyssey.Right from the extended wings of Trivandrum Central Railway Station which he debuted in his twenties, to Cobank Towers at Palayam which enjoyed the tallest building status of the State for 30 years, Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, NABARD, Infosys’ ship-shaped building at Technopark, Taj Vivanta, Poovar Resort and several hundreds of small, medium and large edifices in the State capital and other cities in India and abroad, snatching much public awe, stand tall as sound testimonies to his long tryst with architecture.A good architect should play an active role in weaning the public away from fancy facades and should guide them towards eco-friendly and economic plan in construction, says N. Mahesh. A definite line should be drawn between client’s aspirations, site topography, climatology, building constraints, building maintenance and aesthetics while conceptualising architectural designs, he says. He also says government too should make it mandatory that every building uses green technology.Mahesh nurtures a dream plan for the development of Thiruvananthapuram city which he illustrated through an exhibition recently held in the city, titled ‘MVIRONMENTS’. According to him, the State capital has immense potential as a sustainable green city, as a heritage city, as a knowledge city and as a tourist destination.Green cityThe green city concept envisages 14 per cent of the city to be retained as Green Zone to act as a ‘lung’ for Thiruvananthapuram city. At least one parcel of public land from each 100 wards is to be landscaped with pedestrian walkways. If exclusive vacant government land is not available, a patch of one or two acres can be carved out of schools, colleges or government office premises and may be used after working hours.Heritage cityTrivandrum city is fast loosing its heritage sheen due to reckless construction along avenue roads, especially Fort Area. Mahesh proposes to retain Palayam to Kowdiar as a ‘Heritage Zone’ as 90 per cent of land belongs to the government and buildings of architectural importance and heritage value are mostly on either side of this stretch. Though the Fort area has been ruined by many unauthorised constructions, it is not too late to re-identify and delineate an area around the Padmanabhaswamy Temple and Agraharam as ‘Heritage Zone” with stringent development controls.Knowledge cityThe city’s Draft Master Plan has indicated that educational and research centres can be located in Chengottukonam area. At least, 1,200 acres of land are to be earmarked along the new Kazhakkoottam - Venjaramood link road passing through Chengottukonam / Pothencode belt so that public and private investors may be enticed to locate higher educational and research centres as envisioned in the Draft Master plan.Tourist destinationKovalam is still looked upon as Kerala’s pride as a beach destination and therefore, it is proposed to attract investment in beach front development by zoning additionally 23 km of beach stretch and 30 km of backwaters within Trivandrum district.Multilevel multi-mode express wayWidening of public roads has always invited much public furore and demands strong political will for execution.The only way to sustain free flow of traffic from north to south of the city cutting through CBD (Core Business District) area is to provide a multi-level multi-mode express way ( see picture ) with not more than 6 exits to the road level.A new airportThe total land area of Trivandrum International Airport is 850 acres which presently caters to 2.8 million passengers annually. 2012-statistics say that there were 27,239 aircraft movements and 48,202 tons of cargo movement. The annual growth rate of 11 per cent for international and 15 per cent for domestic passengers is likely to increase to 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively with the completion of Technocity and Vizhinjam port.Thus the projected annual requirement after 15 years will be 5 million pax at the rate of 45,000 aircraft movements per year.Therefore by 2025-30, future expansion at present location being apparently impossible to develop another site within the district for a new airport on a 2,000 acres of land, preferably towards Kollam, stands as the only option.Other flabbergasting proposals of Mahesh include a 20-km-long river-walk or promenade abutting Karamana river and Amayizhanjan Canal, installing Smart Green uniform looking bus shelters and setting up of an Urban Arts Commission to control the ’character of the city’.A good architect should guide the public towardseco-friendly and economic construction, saysN.
