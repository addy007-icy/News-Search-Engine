: On the eve of the last day of its odd-even experiment, the Delhi government said it was now looking forward to the observance of the year’s first car-free day, scheduled at north Delhi, on January 22.Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai said the fourth installment of car-free day, implemented by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government since October last, would be observed between the Vishwa Vidyalaya Metro Station and the Chhatrasal Stadium.The main feature of the initiative will, like on three previous instances, be a cycle rally that several AAP government and Delhi bureaucracy functionaries will take part in.“Since the next car-free day is scheduled to be held near Delhi University, students and teachers of colleges will be seen in active roles on January 22 between 8 a.m. 4p.m.. The Delhi Traffic Police have been asked to prepare a detailed plan related to route diversions and other aspects to ensure minimal harassment for commuters,” Mr. Rai said following a meeting with the Traffic Police, RWAs and the Delhi Transport Department.“We were to observe car-free day across Delhi but, due to implementation of the odd-even scheme, we had to defer the plan,” Mr. Rai said on Thursday in reference to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement three months ago where he had also said that he would cycle to his office on January 22.Meanwhile, Mr. Rai thanked Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur for supporting the odd-even scheme following the Supreme Court’s refusal to allow an urgent hearing of a petition challenging the vehicle-rationing scheme despite a subsequent Delhi High Court decision which upheld it.“On behalf of the entire Delhi Cabinet, I would like to thank the CJI for supporting the scheme ,” Mr. Rai added.Plans to observe the day Delhi-wide “differed” due to the ongoing odd-even experiment
