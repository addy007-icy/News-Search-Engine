The Forum for Development of North Andhra while condemning Narsaraopeta MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao on location at Visakhapatnam of a separate Railway Zone the Centre is expected to sanction to AP, has alleged that the Central and State governments were trying to create differences between people of two areas to ultimately deny the State a separate railway zone. General secretary of the forum A. Ajay Sarma criticised the Chief Minister and the MPs of the region for not condemning the statement of Mr. Sambasiva Rao after it was promised during the elections and was also mentioned in the AP State Reorganisation Act, he said.
