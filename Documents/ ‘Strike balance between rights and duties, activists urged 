A section of activists, who talk about human rights, have stopped thinking about the duties of each of the persons concerned, said Madras High Court Judge N. Kirubakaran.Delivering the presidential lecture at the presentation ceremony of Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer Award on Saturday, Justice Kirubakaran said just five to ten percent of human-rights activists legitimately work towards realising their goals, and strike a balance between rights and duties.“A large number of people misused the statutory provisions pertaining to human rights. So, an order preventing misuse of such statutory provisions was passed. This reduced the misuse, but also inadvertently affected some genuine crusaders for human rights and social justice. I feel sorry for those affected activists,” said Justice Kirubakaran.“Many government employees have also stopped thinking about duties, failing to offer services to citizens. This has severely affected the nation. As a result, taxpayers’ money is getting wasted,” said Justice Kirubakaran.Stressing on the need for more awareness on all aspects of human rights in Tamil Nadu, National Human Rights Commission member Justice D. Murugesan said that of the one lakh human rights cases, only 4,000 were from Tamil Nadu.As many as 37 awardees including former Supreme Court Justice S.
