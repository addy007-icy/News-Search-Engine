The Lodha committee recommendations are a breath of fresh air for players who have been treated as mere employees despite their immense contribution to the game (“Indian cricket’s credibility crisis”, Jan. 6). It is not only the BCCI but even some of the State cricket associations which are corrupt. The suggestions of the committee must be considered to put these associations in order. Since the advent of the IPL, politicians, film stars and business tycoons, who were earlier in no way connected with the sport, started patronising the game. Young players began to be lured with big money and illegal betting and match-fixing have come to rule the roost. Against this backdrop, the committee’s sweeping reforms are welcome.K.R.Srinivasan,SecunderabadCricket has become the private fiefdom of a select few. The suggestions of the Lodha committee are innovative, and, if implemented in true spirit, will restore the credibility of the game. Betting should be legalised as is the norm in most sporting events in the West. The BCCI’s claim that it is a charitable organisation sounds hollow. The government should recover all tax dues from such “charitable organisations”, whose incomes run into crores.H.N. Ramakrishna,BengaluruWhile recommendations such as asking for transparency in the BCCI’s functioning and for accountability for its actions are laudable, the suggestion to legalise betting will open a Pandora’s Box. Incidents of match-fixing will proliferate and the situation will only worsen. The very purpose for which the committee was appointed will be defeated. Keeping the netas and business tycoons at arm’s length from the Board’s administration will solve most of the problems.P.K. Varadarajan,Chennai
