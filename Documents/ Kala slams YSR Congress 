Accusing the Opposition YSR Congress Party of obstructing the State government’s efforts to develop Andhra Pradesh, president of the Telugu Desam Party’s State unit K. Kala Venakta Rao on Monday said in a sarcastic manner that the Opposition did not know anything except jail and bail.Mr. Rao, who was on a district tour, addressed the media at the party office here.“Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is striving 14 hours a day to develop the State. But, the Opposition party is obstructing him on all fronts without valid reasons. It is opposing the construction of Amaravati and conducting the Janmabhoomi-Maa Vooru programme,” he said, adding that the proceedings of the recent session of the Legislative Assembly were the classic example to showcase the functioning of the Opposition in the State.“Despite having financial problems, the government waived farm loans and announced waiver of SHG loans in a phased manner. Once the construction of Amaravati is completed, it can become one of the most sought after destinations for the international traders,” he said lambasting the Opposition for not coming forward to join hands with the government.Party’s district unit president Parvatha Chitti Babu was present.
