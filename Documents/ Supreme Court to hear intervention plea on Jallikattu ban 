The Supreme Court on Wednesday has agreed to hear at 3 p.m. an intervention application filed by four persons said to be affected by the >apex court stay on Centreâ€™s notification allowing Jallikattu.The petitoners, represented by advocate N. Rajaraman, made an urgent mention before a Bench of Justice Dipak Misra and N.V. Ramana at 2 p.m.It was argued that the stay has struck "a mortal blow to the religious faith of devotees of Lord Shiva." The petition said the stay order was most inopportune as all the arrangements for the Jallikattu festivities were over.The court called for the documents regarding the issue and posted the plea for hearing at 3 p.m.Mr. Rajaraman had mentioned the application before the Chief Justice in the morning, but he was referred to Justice Misra's Bench, which had handled the petitions and ordered the stay on the January 7 notification.
