When the Lord incarnates time and again, it is out of His Sankalpa and not by the compulsion of karma as is the case with the jivatma.In the Vishnu Sahasranama, Bhishma celebrates the leelas enacted by the Lord and shows how they make Him accessible to us, though He remains Supreme and higher than the highest, said Sri Dushyanth Sridhar in a discourse.Andal and other azhwars realise the good fortune of those who lived with Him in Gokula and imagine themselves to be one among them to experience His greatness. Their hymns recreate the Bhagavata episodes that speak of the birth and growth of the divine Krishna.How fortunate is Yasodha, is their common refrain. What past karma has conferred this good fortune on her when she brings up this bewitching child, they wonder.Even Brahma, Indra and other celestial beings are drawn by Krishna’s childhood period when He is brought up by Yasodha.But now and then she has to unwillingly use the rod when His butter stealing episodes net a whole array of complaints. She screws His ears and the devout Azhwar’s heart goes out to the compassion of the Lord who allows Himself to be thus treated. She brings Him near a grinding stone wishing to teach Him a lesson. She goes in search of a rope and the child remains standing in obediently. The ropes she brings are not sufficient to tie Him. They fall short by an inch. She is able to tie Him only when He allows Himself to be tied by her.This is symbolic of the truth that He who cannot be caught and bound can be sought by true devotion and love. A jivatma’s bonds of karma which tie him to samsara automatically fall apart by His grace.
