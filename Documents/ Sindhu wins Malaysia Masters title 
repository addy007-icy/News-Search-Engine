Two-time World Championship bronze-medallist, India’s P.V. Sindhu made a rousing start to the new season as she clinched the Malaysia Masters Grand Prix Gold title after defeating Scotland’s Kristy Gilmour in straight games in the final in Penang on Sunday.The third seeded Indian had lost to Gilmour in 2013 French Open in their only meeting but today she showed why she is considered to be one of India’s most revered women’s singles shuttler as she avenged her loss with a dominating 21-15 21-9 win in a 32-minute clash to clinch her fifth Grand Prix Gold title.This is her second Malaysia Masters Grand Prix Gold title, having won it in 2013 as well. She also completed a hat—trick at the Macau Open Grand Prix Gold in November last year.Sindhu, who had an unbeaten streak at the Premier Badminton League (PBL), produced a dominating performance as she showed better court coverage and cut down on her errors to outclass her opponent in the summit clash.In the opening game, Sindhu made early strides, moving to 5-2 and then sped away with her superior game plan. She had a healthy 12-6 lead which she increased to 18-10.The Scottish shuttler, on the other hand, reeled off four straight points but could never threaten Sindhu who closed the game without much effort.In the second game, Sindhu once again opened up a slender 5-2 lead which was quickly erased by Gilmour. But the Indian then changed gears and moved to a 9-5 and then jumped to a huge 16-5 lead.Gilmour tried in vain to narrow the gap but the Indian slammed the door on her rival.
