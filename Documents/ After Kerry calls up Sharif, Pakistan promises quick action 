In view of the growing doubt over the Foreign Secretary-level talks of January 15, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called up Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday to highlight the need to stay the course for dialogue.“Continuation of India-Pakistan talks are needed in the interest of regional stability and the leadership role by both Prime Ministers is required to ensure continuous dialogue,” Mr. Kerry was quoted as saying in a statement issued for the press from the office of the Pakistan Prime Minister.Earlier at a prime time interview, Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry had reiterated that Pakistan will not allow terrorists to use its territory to launch attacks on the other countries. Mr. Sharif also maintained the anti-terror commitment and said: “Pakistan is swiftly carrying out investigations in a transparent manner and will bring out the truth. The world will see our effectiveness and sincerity in this regard. Pakistan is eliminating terrorism from its soil and will not allow any one to use Pakistani soil to conduct terror operations abroad.”
