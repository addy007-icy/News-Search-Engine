Defending ProKabaddi League (PKL) champion U Mumba unveiled its new jersey for the upcoming Season 3 through a two-year partnership with adidas at a city mall here.Speaking on the sidelines of the launch event, local star Rishank Devadiga, a key component to last year’s title success, hoped the new, striking orange jersey “would bring his team luck for the new season”. Standing tall and looking imposing with his hulk-like physique, 22-year-old Devadiga is one of the young players to have benefitted from this ambitious venture introduced two years ago. He left an indelible impression in the minds of the fans with his fitness, agility and fearless raids.“The pre-season preparations were very good. We had a fortnight-long preparatory camp at Cheruvathur in Kasargod district of Kerala last month, and recently one here in Mumbai. We have been practising continuously day and night...so we are ready for the new season,” he said.With PKL becoming a bi-annual event from this year — the two editions coming close together within the space of just five months after the last one ended in August — Devadiga believes it is “a good idea” by the organisers, but warned fitness will be the key.“The game will grow in popularity, not that it isn’t already. Having two leagues in a year will give opportunities for more young players to come through and perform at the highest level. But fitness will also be key for us. How we cope is going to be important. We have our physio and fitness trainers who will help us stay at the required level.”U Mumba kicks off Season 3 in Visakhapatnam on Saturday against Telugu Titans.
