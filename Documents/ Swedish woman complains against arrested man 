One more foreign tourist, this time reportedly from Sweden, lodged a complaint with the Kovalam police on Friday stating that Nizar, 28, who was arrested on Thursday on charges of attempting to sexually harass a German tourist, had attempted to harass her as well.The police said the second complainant, a 64-year-old national of Sweden, had seen photographs of the accused in Fridayâ€™s newspapers and approached the police, stating that the same man had attempted to sexually harass her, barely half an hour before he tried to harass a 37-year-old German tourist early Thursday.Nizar, of Cheruvathoor in Kasaragod, had allegedly posed as a plumber called in to repair the toilet flush, to gain entry into the room of the Swede. He had apparently used the same ploy with the German too.The Swedish woman complained that he had pulled a knife out of his pocket as soon as he got into the room and threatened her before trying to harass her. However, she had managed to snatch the knife from him, following which he fled. The woman said she was thoroughly shaken by the incident and was late in reporting the matter to the police since she did not know what to do.Following the second complaint, the police have registered a fresh case against the accused. The accused was charged under Sections 354 A (unwelcome physical advances towards women), 452 (house trespass for causing hurt) and 506 (II) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Nizar, who used to work in hotels in the city, the latest being a popular joint in Attakulangara, was reportedly drunk and was arrested a few hours after the German national lodged her complaint. The police said an application would be moved to get Nizar, in remand now, in custody.
