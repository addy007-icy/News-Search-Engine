The Jajpur police have detained three persons on charges of raping and murdering a five-year-old girl on Monday.The body of the child was found near railway tracks close to Jajpur-Keonjhar Road Railway Station on Sunday evening. The girl’s mother and a neighbour found it near the railway track.The mother is a daily wage earner and used to go to work leaving the girl alone in the Panasia slum close to the station. On Sunday, when she returned from work, the girl was missing.“We have detained three persons in the age group of 20 to 35 years. Inhabitants of the slum are being extensively questioned,” said Rajiv Lochan Das, Inspector-in-charge of Jajpur police station.Since investigators are yet to find any eye-witness to the crime, they are building the case on circumstantial evidence. “We are making all efforts to nab the main accused. We are not sure if there was more than one perpetrator,” Mr. Das said.The girl’s father had abandoned the mother and children long ago.
