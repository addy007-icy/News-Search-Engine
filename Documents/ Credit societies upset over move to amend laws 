The Karnataka State Primary Agricultural Credit Societies/Banks Welfare Federation has condemned the State government’s move to amend laws related to societies and banks. Addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, State president of the federation K. Mahanthappa and other office-bearers said that despite the federation office-bearers airing their grievances before the senior officials concerned and the Ministers, the laws governing these cooperative financial institutions were being amended, that too without consultation with stakeholders.Mr. Mahanthappa said that it was condemnable that the representatives of credit societies and banks had not been involved in the dialogue, while the district credit societies, against which they had complaints, were invited for a discussion on the proposed amendments to the law. He said that instead of sorting out the pending issues, the State government was initiating steps to bring back the Common Cadre Committee (CCC), which, in other words, meant more exploitation of the societies.Mr. Mahanthappa said that the credit societies and banks had incurred loss because of the implementation of pro-farmer schemes such as zero-interest crop loan and loans to self-help groups. And, to add to their woes, the Union government had imposed various taxes on them, he said. To deliberate on the next course of action and prevail upon the State government to drop the proposed amendments, the federation would hold a special general body meeting at the Municipal Employees Hall at JC Nagar in Hubballi on January 11 at 11 a.m. “We will take a decision whether to agitate if the government fails to give a positive reply to our demands”, he said. Federation vice-president D.S. Badagigoudra and employees federation president K.V. Hiregoudar were present.
