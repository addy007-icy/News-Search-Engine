An Air India flight to Bhubaneswar from New Delhi was delayed by five hours allegedly due to pressure by some VIPs, who forced the national carrier to schedule the aircraft along with its crew to Bhopal instead, a charge denied by the airline.Air India operated its flight to Bhubaneswar at around 12.30 am on Saturday against its scheduled departure at 7.30 pm on Friday.“Our flight from here was held back by Air India as the airline deployed the plane and crew bound for Bhubaneswar on its Delhi-Bhopal flight,” said BJD Member of Parliament Tathagat Satpathy who was flying to Bhubaneshwar by the same flight.Satpathy, who staged a protest outside the airport against the delay, alleged that Air India rescheduled its Bhubaneswar flight due to some VIPs, who forced the airline to assign the aircraft for Bhopal.Tathagatha Satpathy stages a dharna outside the gate at airport! >pic.twitter.com/xrucxzvecx— Rajdeep Sardesai (@sardesairajdeep) >January 8, 2016The national carrier, however, said it did not give preference to any particular flight and the alleged delay was caused due to the heavy fog at the Delhi airport on Friday, which had sent flight schedule of all airlines including that of the Air India topsy turvy.Due to heavy fog from Friday morning and resultant delays, most of the crews’ duty time was limiting later on in the day. Crew were planned as per their arrivals from earlier flights, back to Delhi and sequenced based on the duty time remaining, Air India said.One BJP min of state from MP and two judges on Bhopal flight. Is that reason enough for AI MD to ask pilots to move from one Flt to other?— Rajdeep Sardesai (@sardesairajdeep) >January 8, 2016“At no time did AI give any preference to any particular flight. Arriving and available crew duty time remaining as per regulations was checked and they were scheduled for the flights based on time and sequence,” it said.
