Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad on Thursday described the BJP and the RSS as “bed bugs” who spreads all kind of rumours in the society.The opposition BJP, of late, has been trading charges against Mr. Prasad for acting like “Super CM” in Nitish Kumar-led government.“Yeh sab BJP aur RSS ke log khatmal hain…inka kaam khali samaj mein rumour phailana hai [this BJP and RSS people are bed bugs whose only work is to spread all kinds of rumor in society],” Mr. Prasad told journalists. Mr. Prasad whose younger son Tejaswi Yadav is the Deputy Chief Minister and the elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is Health Minister, had hit headlines for all wrong reasons as he has been caught giving instructions and directions to state health officials and doctors.He even made “surprise inspection” to a government-run hospital. However, his minister sons defended his action saying “he is national president of a party which is in the government and he does social work when people who have voted for his party come to him for their works to be done.”The RJD chief has also declared that he would visit Varanasi and across the country to counter the BJP and take on Narendra Modi. Meanwhile, the RJD youth wing leaders have decided to felicitate the party chief with “flower-rains” at eight places on his route to reach the party’s meeting place on January 17. “The RJD is scheduled to hold its national convention at local Sri Krishna Memorial Hall on Sunday ”, said State party chief Ram Chandra Purve.
