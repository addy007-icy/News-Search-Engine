Back in the late 90s, when I worked closely with KB sir, I would always wonder if his dialogue delivery style was like Rajnikanth, or vice-versa.On the day of the shoot, Ranjith arrived before me at the studio. Initially, he was calm and composed. He opened up over a cup of tea. He has a terrific sense of humour and we spoke as if we’d known each other for a long time. Later, he said, “I am very particular about everyone in my team being respected and treated well.”I also noticed during the conversation that he instinctively sat perpendicularly to the direction of the chair. His body language exudes confidence and style. His eyes smile, and his laughter is infectious.“ Attakathi was my life’s story,” he said. I had not watched Madras before our meeting, but when I did, I noticed how similar the protagonist’s body language and dialogue delivery was to Ranjith’s. I couldn’t but wonder what plans he has for Rajinikanth in Kabali.
