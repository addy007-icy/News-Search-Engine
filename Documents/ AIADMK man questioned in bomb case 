The Madurai city police on Saturday questioned an AIADMK man on the charge of hurling of minor crude bombs at the office of the Madurai West MLA and Minister for Cooperation ‘Sellur’ K. Raju at Sammattipuram here and at the party office on Panagal road on Saturday last.Pasumpon Pandian, who is the district deputy secretary of the trade union wing of AIADMK, was summoned by the SS Colony police and the enquiry took place at the Madurai South All Women Police Station (AWPS) for about two hours, sources said.According to the police, Pasumpon Pandian was inquired on suspicion whether any intra-party squabble could have led to the hurling of bombs. Mr. Pandian and Mr. Raju were reportedly not in good terms and the former was criticising the Minister for alleged lack of developmental works in the Madurai west constituency.Police sources, however, said that Mr. Pandian pleaded ignorance about the bomb incident and claimed that his relationship with Mr. Raju was good. Recently, Mr. Pandian’s wife also filed a petition at the Madurai City Police Commissioner’s office alleging risk to their family.It has to be noted that the city police had also questioned two DMK men – M. Jayaram and S.R. Gopi – at the Mathichiyam police station on Wednesday last in this connection. Summoning an AIADMK member was not well taken by the party functionaries, especially, when elections were fast approaching.Apart from the hurling of the bombs at the two places, a country-made bomb and two petrol bombs were also recovered from the venue of the AIADMK meeting organised by Mr. Raju on Sunday last.A police official said that five special teams had been formed and investigation was being pursued in all possible angles.
