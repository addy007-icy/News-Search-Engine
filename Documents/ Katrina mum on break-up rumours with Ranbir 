Bollywood actor Katrina Kaif sidestepped questions related to rumours about her break-up with actor-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor and said that, as a professional, she was focusing on her work.“Being in the public eye, you are going to be written about in the media. It happened to me early in my career,” Katrina told reporters in Mumbai when quizzed about the rumours. According to the Dhoom 3 star, the media and the film industry needed each other. “We need each other, we work together. The media also helps us in passing the message to the audience. It is part and parcel of the job. Take the good with the bad,” she said.“I am here as a professional.... I am here in the capacity of my work,” she added.
