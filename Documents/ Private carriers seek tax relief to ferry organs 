Owners of firms that run chartered plane services have sought relief from the service tax levied on them when they ferry organs.The city has witnessed seven heart transplants over the past year, of which three were inter-State initiatives. To give a boost to inter-State connections, streamline the transport process and budget, and to ensure no organ goes waste, State health administration and officials of the four hospitals registered for heart transplants, met representatives of three aircraft carriers at the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) office at Sion Hospital on Wednesday. A key part of the discussion was the cost at which a private aircraft could feasibly ferry an organ.In the meeting, the aircraft carriers put forth their main condition: they cannot be charged the 14.36% service tax when they are plying flights as air ambulances and ferrying organs to save a life, sources said.“It was a preliminary meeting. We will make a proper document and give it to the airline people,” said Dr Gauri Rathod, assistant director of health services who oversees organ transplants in Maharashtra.She said the idea is to have a uniform system to save time and money. “The airline representatives discussed their expectations, such as the possibility of service and landing taxes being waived,” she said. All the issues will be discussed with health minister Deepak Sawant soon, Dr Rathod said.The three private operators that attended the meeting on Wednesday included Sai Craft Limited, Aviators Air Rescue and International Critical Care Air Transfer Team. Of these, Gurgaon-based Sai Craft quoted Rs 75,000 as its per hour rate for a helicopter and Rs 1.25 lakh as its hourly rate for a six-wing aircraft. “We have given them a flat rate. We are also looking at putting our 2% CSR from our group companies into this,” said Chander Mohan Arora, MD of Sai Craft.The carriers say they are looking at fixed rates so as to leave no room for negotiations
