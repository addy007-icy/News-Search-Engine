“I was happy with my level of play today and will look to sustain it,” said Stan Wawrinka after beating good friend Benoit Paire in Saturday’s semifinal of the Chennai Open.He said he focused on staying aggressive and tough. “It was important for me to be aggressive and tough. It's never easy to play a good friend. But, it’s always good to share a big moment together.”The Swiss said he would look to sustain the level in the summit clash on Sunday. “It’s a different match. It doesn’t matter who I play.”The defending champion hasn't dropped a set in 11 matches at the competition. Asked whether he consciously attempts to uphold it, he said, “I've been serving really well which helps me a lot. But what's important is not to try and never lose a set but win the match.”
