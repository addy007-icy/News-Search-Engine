The Opposition Bhartiya Janata Party on Wednesday slammed the Nitish Kumar-led government for withdrawing a case against coalition partner Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad, his two sons and 262 other party workers and asked whether the move was not tantamount to defamation of the Patna High Court which was hearing the case.A case against them was filed on July 27 last year for indulging in vandalism, preventing government officials’ work and stopping vehicles of judges who were on their way to the court during RJD’s Bihar bandh.“Has the State government taken permission from the Patna High Court which had earlier taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and has been hearing the case, before withdrawing the case from the lower court?” asked senior State BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi. Mr Modi also charged that the government worked under pressure of “Super CM” Lalu Prasad to withdraw the case against him, his two sons and over two hundred party workers.“Will the State government now withdraw cases against RJD leader and former party MP Mohd Shahabuddin who is in Jail for a long time and several other RJD and JD(U) MPs and MLAs under pressure of Lalu Prasad?” asked the BJP leader.He further added that what the State government would do over thousands of such cases involving agitation by employee unions and citizens who staged protest and jammed road against the state government? Mr Modi also hit out at the Chief Minister for “bowing to the RJD chief Lalu Prasad for the sake of being in power”.On Tuesday, the chief judicial magistrate of the Patna civil court, Om Prakash had accepted the plea of the government lawyer for withdrawal of the caseunder section 321 of Cr PC.The charge-sheet in the case was filed on October 13 last year. However, of the 24 FIRs registered under various police stations against RJD supporters during the bandh call only one involving the RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his two minister-sons were withdrawn.The case was filed last year on July 27 for vandalism and preventing government officials and stopping vehicles of at least three Patna High Court judges during the bandh call.The case was registered against them under various sections with Kotwali police station following the directive of the then Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Vikas Vaibhav.
