Warmer winter in Delhi this year has not been able to arrest deaths among the homeless, with figures till January 11 revealing 82 deaths as opposed to 99 during the same period last year.“The moderate winter has not reduced the number of deaths that occur during the season in the city. Low night temperatures, lack of proper clothing, food and shelter plays havoc with the health of the homeless who already have compromised immunity.,” said Sunil Kumar Aledia of the Centre for Holistic Development, which is working in this sector."Eighty per cent of all unclaimed bodies found in Delhi are those of the homeless," added Mr. AlediaThe police maintain a record of the unidentified bodies on its Zonal Integrated Police Network and update it regularly.Those living on the streets have many health issues that worsen with acute malnourishment and harsh climatic conditions.Dehydration, poor sanitation, infections, inadequate or late medical aid often prove fatal for these people, said Mr. Aledia.The deaths have occurred despite the Delhi government’s claims of being able to accommodate 19,000 homeless in night shelters and the “Rain Basera” mobile application to track and rescue homeless people.“The shelters are to be equipped with basic facilities, including blankets, mattresses, mats, toilets, drinking water, first-aid box and fire extinguishers among others. However, the reality is that the quality of care provided in these shelters is very poor. Toilets are unclean and virtually unusable, and something as basic as drinking water is not available,’’ added Mr. Aledia.Those working in the sector added that the worst hit are children, women, elderly and those who are not well.According to India’s 2011 Census, there are 449,761 houseless households/families with a 20 per cent decadal growth.The census reported 46,724 homeless in Delhi, whereas the Supreme Court Commissioner’s Office mapped through a new technique estimated about 2,46,800 homeless in the Capital.Lack of proper clothing, food and shelter wreck havoc with the health of the homeless
