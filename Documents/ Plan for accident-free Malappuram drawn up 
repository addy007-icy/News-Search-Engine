: The Motor Vehicles Department and the Police Department have given shape to a comprehensive project to make Malappuram an accident-free district by roping in the local civic bodies. It will be the first time civic bodies get involved in the district’s road safety.The project, to be implemented in phases, is expected to bring down the number of road accidents in the district. “Our objective is to make Malappuram accident-free by involving the people,” said district panchayat president A.P. Unnikrishnan and Regional Transport Officer M.P. Ajit Kumar. Civic bodies and the people across the district will be mobilised by holding meetings, conducting awareness campaigns, strictly enforcing the traffic laws, and involving service organisations such as the National Service Scheme, National Cadet Corps, and Student Police Cadet. “We hope to get all motorists to wear helmets and seat-belt by February end,” said Mr. Ajit Kumar.The first phase will see intensive campaigns through educational institutions by volunteers of Kudumbasree and Asha. Classes will be taken for public transport drivers and an awareness drive will be conducted for people from all walks of life. Illegal hoardings and road blocks will be removed in the second phase.Parking will be made scientific and civic bodies will review the implementation.
