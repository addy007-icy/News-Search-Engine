Ahead of the Republic Day celebrations, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) has hightened vigil at important railway stations falling within Tiruchi Division limits to prevent any untoward incidents.Field-level officers of the force have been instructed to carry out anti-sabotage checks in stations and railway yards and drive home safety measures to travellers.As part of this exercise, RPF personnel and those attached to the Bomb Detection Squad of the force conducted anti-sabotage checks on Thursday in Tiruchi, an important railway station in the division.Armed with necessary paraphernalia, the anti-sabotage team checked vehicles entering the railway station looking out for any suspicious objects inside the vehicles.A detective dog of the force trained in detecting explosive substances was engaged during the anti-sabotage checks.Checks were carried out in three trains: Tiruchi–Chennai Cholan Express, Tiruchi–Karaikal passenger and the Coimbatore–Mayiladuthurai Jan Shatabdhi Express after it arrived in Tiruchi.Passengers were advised to alert RPF or the Government Railway Police personnel in case they noticed any unclaimed substance or suspicious looking objects at the stations.Alongside carrying out anti-sabotage checks, the RPF personnel carried out an awareness campaign in Tiruchi Junction on the safety measures.
