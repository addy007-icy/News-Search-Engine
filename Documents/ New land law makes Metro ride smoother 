The heavy machines are out on the field and commuters on the busy Mysuru Road will soon start to see visible progress on extension of the Mysuru line towards Kengeri. Properties have been acquired without a whimper or complaint, speeding up work on the much-delayed Phase I line.Within a ‘few days’, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) expects preliminary constructions to begin on the 6.5-km line from Mysuru Road station at Nayandanahalli towards Kengeri. The only hurdle for the construction of piers – and the accompanying widening of roads – is the permission to fell trees that is needed to be accorded by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) after a public consultation meet.For BMRCL, the land acquisition – which is being conducted under the new Act – has been ‘smooth’. Over Rs. 100 crore compensations have been given to 59 private properties.One property owner got a generous Rs. 16 crore for half an acre.The amount for 10 properties is yet to be deposited as the land is under dispute. In such cases, the reimbursement is deposited with the courts.Officials believe introduction of the new land acquisition act – which more than doubles the rate of compensation – has made the process smoother, with no objection received so far.Other ReachesThe idea of using wide service roads along highways has been approved by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Officials believe this will save on the project cost.Now, instead of acquiring 13 metres of highly built-up land on the 12-km stretch between Central Silk Board junction and Electronics City, BMRCL will have to acquire between 5 and 7 metres to build a new service road.It has sent a similar proposal for the 3.77-km extension between Nagasandra and Bangalore International Exhibition Centre.(Reporting by Mohit M.
