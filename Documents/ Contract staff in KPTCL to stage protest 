Contract labourers working in Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (KPTCL) will stage a protest on January 11 to press for their demands.Stopping retrenchment of contract workers, framing special recruitment rules to regularise their services, payment of revised wages along with provident fund and ESI, and safety measures were some of the demands being put forth by them.K. Somashekar, general secretary of KPTCL Contract Labourers Association, told presspersons here on Saturday that a large number of contract workers had put in over 10 to 15 years of service while no steps were initiated to regularise their services. He criticised the government for meting out injustice to the contract workers by not regularising their services based on their educational qualification and technical knowledge, while filling up the posts of junior engineers and linemen.
