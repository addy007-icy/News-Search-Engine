Vigilance Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge S.S. Vasan made it clear that the new probe would be a court-monitored one under Section 156 (3) of the Code Criminal Procedure. He said the probe would be in accordance with an order pronounced by the Supreme Court in 2008.Similar probeThe judge ordered a similar probe against Mr. Ramesh, who openly confessed to paying bribe to the Minister. The judge criticised the Vigilance for the ineffective handling of the probe against the Minister.The inquiry was ordered based on a complaint lodged by activist George Vattukulam, who quoted statements of Mr. Ramesh alleging that Mr. Babu had demanded Rs.10 crore as bribe for reopening the bars. Mr. Ramesh had also stated publicly that the bar owners had paid Rs.50 lakh as advance to the Minister on October 31 last year. When the court asked whether the Vigilance had completed the preliminary inquiry, the additional legal adviser of the Vigilance responded in the negative. The judge wondered whether the Vigilance was behaving like the mythological warrior Arjuna who had lost Gandeeva (the vital weapon).When the additional legal adviser stated that some of the probe reports had been submitted to the Lok Ayukta, the judge expressed his reservations by asking whether the VACB wanted the Vigilance courts to be closed down.The judge said the quick verification report could have been completed in 10 days if the VACB was earnest and committed to carrying out the court's order. He said the Vigilance should maintain the due respect to the court order.
