Hours after the operation that saw Lt. Col. Niranjan E.Kumar dead and two others from their unit critically injured, NSG commandoes came all the way from Pathankot to Bengaluru accompanying the body of the deceased officer.As is the a practise, they recounted the last few minutes of Lt. Col. Niranjan’s life to the family.“Sahib volunteered for the mission out of turn and led from the front,” one of them said.“It was a team of five with Niranjan sahib in front, followed by two others. The other two were giving cover to the trio. We were combing the area for explosives. The team came across the body of a terrorist. As they were checking the body, we heard a explosion. It is not clear whether the body of the terrorist was booby-trapped with explosives or a terrorist lurking nearby had hurled a grenade. Due to the dust and smoke, we lost precious moments before we could get to sahib. Being the one in front, he bore the brunt of the explosion and succumbed to his injuries while the two behind him are battling for survival,” the commando told the martyr’s family and his course mates.The commandoes accompanied the mortal remains of Lt. Col. Niranjan to Palakkad and are expected to participate in the last rites on Tuesday.
