The Odisha government is planning to set up its first automated vehicle fitness testing centre at Cuttack. Here the vehicles would be driven on a testing track to know their road worthiness.“Fitness of vehicles is critically linked with high rate of accidents. We have already started working on setting up automated vehicle fitness testing centres where vehicles will be automatically assessed on 25 to 30 parameters through computers,” said State Transport Commissioner Chandrasekhar Kumar.Mr. Kumar, who returned from Nasik after visiting a similar facility, said the automated centre would help bring transparency in the process of certifying a vehicle. The facility at Cuttack is expected to be operational in 2017. Within next two to three years, such centres would come up in three to four towns, he said.Similarly, the transport department would set up testing tracks at seven urban centres where the applicants would be awarded driving license based on their performance on these tracks. There will be no human interference in assessing driving capability, said Mr. Kumar. These tracks are being set up in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Balasore and Angul.Around 9,640 accidents occurred on the Odisha roads that caused 3,920 deaths in 2014. The National Highway and State Highway network constitute12 per cent of the total road length, but 75 per cent of accidents took place on these roads.Pointing out that vehicle population has seen an exponential growth in during past four decade, Mr. Kumar said, “in 1970, only 7,000 vehicles were registered in the State. It has up 17 times by 2016. We have to be ready to regulate high number of vehicles on roads by strengthening infrastructure.”He also informed that modern driving training centres would also be set up in the State.
