A group of activists are all set to move court against the elevated rapid transit corridor coming up along the State Highway-19 stretch passing through the city, terming the project as “illogical”.T. Sathyamoorthy, a lawyer-activist, told The Hindu that what purpose would be the mere 900 metre corridor that was coming up along the present road from near Perumal Temple to the old collectorate building, serve the people.“It is aimed at bypassing just one intersection of Palladam and Dharapuram road near the old bus stand. The other point the authorities said was that the project will ease the congestion near the exit of old bus stand, which is actually caused only by the haphazard stopping of long distance buses at the mouth of the exit gate of the bus stand”, he said.Activists were of the view that instead of this short corridor, the Highways Department should have continued with the planned and estimated elevated corridor project from near the present collectorate building to the northern side of the River Noyyal which would have covered the said 900 metre stretch too.“Here in the present project, the traffic joins the same road at both sides where as the other project, if got materialised actually avoided the travelling through congested road stretches and many signals to reach the other side of the River Noyyal”, Mr. Sathyamoorthy said.
