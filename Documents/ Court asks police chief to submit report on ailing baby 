A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the Thiruvananthapuram City Police Commissioner to submit a detailed report on the present health condition of the ailing baby, who has been admitted to a private hospital following the court’s intervention.The directive was issued by the Bench comprising Justice C.K. Abdul Rehim and Shaji P. Chaly when the petition filed by the father of the baby girl came up for hearing on Thursday. The court had issued the directive to admit the baby, who was afflicted with liver cirrhosis, in a private hospital, after her mother, the petitioner’s wife, and father-in-law refused to provide her treatment owing to marital problems. The child’s father, Basheer of Chowara in Thiruvananthapuram, had alleged in his habeas corpus petition that though the doctors had suggested a liver transplantation surgery to save the baby, his wife and father–in-law had not admitted her in any hospital for treatment. The court asked the City Police Commissioner to mention in the report the steps taken for finding out a suitable donor, the minimum fee and the expenses for the surgery and follow-up treatment.The court was informed earlier that the baby was admitted as an inpatient in the hospital. The police authorities had taken efforts to find out a suitable donor for the surgery.The Bench posted the case to January 19 for further hearing.
