Those visiting Wadapally would not have missed the sight of a 65-year-old woman ferrying people on her boat throughout the day.Swarra Ramalakshmamma has been working at Wadapally, the confluence of river Krishna and its tributary Musi, for over five decades now. She also ferries villagers of Ganeshpahad, who live on the other side of the river. But now, she is out of work! With the river going dry one-and-a-half years ago owing to the drought conditions, she has lost the only means of earning her livelihood.People from surrounding villages of Wadapally, amounting to about 2,500 population, had to take Ramalakshmamma’s boat to reach Wadapally, which they frequently used to visit for almost all purposes. Now they are walking across the river bed to reach Wadapally, and that has rendered Ramalakshmamma jobless.When the river had water, she had helped some youngsters to operate motorised boats. But since many pilgrims who visited the village preferred her boat to the motorised ones, she used to collect tickets for the latter and earned some money through that.Speaking to The Hindu , M.D. Iqbal, who operates a motorised boat, said she knew nothing except operating the manually driven boat, which has no takers nowadays.She had migrated from Chinthur in Khammam district to Wadapally during 1960s with her family. She was married off to one Narasimha Rao at the age of 15 when she took up the profession of ferrying pilgrims at the temple town. A Ganeshpadah resident, K. Ramesh, said they have a long association with Lakshmama, but they were not in a state to extend any help to her since most of the villagers were poor tribals.Lakshmmma’s husband died a few years ago and she is now living with her daughter while her two sons have migrated to other places in search of livelihood.
