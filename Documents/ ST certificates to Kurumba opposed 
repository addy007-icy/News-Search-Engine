Stating that Kurumba and Kurumba Gounder castes which is listed as Most Backward Communities in the State are given certificate as Kurumans of Scheduled Tribes, members of various tribal organisation staged a demonstration, near the Collectorate here, on Monday.They said that the Kurumba is different from Kuruman who have their origins in Wayanad in Kerala, and have different a lifestyle.But Kurumba community obtained an order from Madras High Court to get certificate as Kuruman, they said.Over 5,000 such bogus certificates are provided in such a short span as officials failed to conduct inquiry, and follow the courtâ€™s order.The GO No 388 dated May 6, 1977 states that Kurumba community is considered as Kuruman ST.However, the order was cancelled by another GO No 748 dated October 27, 1977 as the Parliament only can include or exclude a caste as Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.But the GO 748 was not followed and Kuruman ST certificates were issued to the Most Backward Class too.
