The Delhi government has extended the deadline for nursery admissions under the economically weaker section (EWS) category till February 5 to offer relief to parents struggling with online applications. The rest of the schedule, however, shall remain the same.“The last date for nursery online admission under the economically weaker section (EWS) category in private schools is being extended for two weeks,” Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia said.“The Delhi government introduced the portal for online admission under EWS this year. As many as 64,000 applications were received for 27,000 seats in private schools,” Mr. Sisodia added.The Delhi government had made the admission process online for schools recognised under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules (DSEAR), 1973, but it continued with the offline process for schools recognised under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009. This left parents confused about which school was under which category.Nursery admissions in city schools began on January 1 and will end on March 31. While Friday was the last date for submitting the applications, the first list will be out on February 15, followed by another list on February 29.Accessibility to the internet and lack of awareness about the online procedure was among the major problems many parents from the EWS category faced, with many of them complaining that help in the form of volunteers did not reach them. The move to make admissions online came in the wake of fake admissions detected in previous years. Prior to online admissions, the government would only issue a common form and monitor the draw-of-lots. As per the online system, however, the admission process will be centralised.
