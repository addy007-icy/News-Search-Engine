P.M. Kamalamma, member, National Commission for Scheduled Castes, has asked the State government to set up special courts to try cases pertaining to SCs in all districts. At present, special courts exist only in three districts of the State, she said. She was addressing a press conference here on Thursday after reviewing policy matters regarding SCs at a district-level meeting.She said there was a decline in the cases of atrocities against the SCs and attributed it to a higher level of literacy and awareness among the people. But in several instances, cases were being registered under the IPC and not under rules regarding SCs. She has asked authorities to explain the matter.Regarding payment of compensation to victims of atrocities, registration of the cases was being insisted upon in Kerala, whereas an FIR would be sufficient in other States. She has asked those concerned to rectify anomalies in this connection.Land for cultivation was not being assigned to the SCs in most districts of Kerala owing to scarcity of land. Noting that land was available in Idukki and Wayanad districts, she wanted the authorities to find out whether land could be assigned to beneficiaries there.She expressed satisfaction at the treatment meted out to the SCs in Kerala in general and Alappuzha district in particular. Enrolment of the SCs in professional colleges was good. The government was making payments for the studies of the SC students. She wanted the government to set up post-matric hostels in all districts. She visited the SC residential hostel in Alappuzha and expressed satisfaction at the accommodation and maintenance.Now just 3 districts have special courts: SC forum memberSeeks land for farming for community members
