Archbishop of Bhopal, Leo Cornelio, on Saturday said the Madhya Pradesh government was yet to respond to its request regarding handing over some of the state-run schools in backward districts to the Catholic church to improve their educational standards.“A year ago, I personally asked Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to hand over a couple of government schools in backward districts to us, so that we improve the educational standards in such institutes,” Cornelio told reporters here.He said this while providing details of the concluding ceremony of ‘Year of Consecrated life’ scheduled to be held here on Sunday.“After my meeting, one of our principals wrote to the government for adoption of government schools. But we have not received any response from it. We are not worried at all over the issue,” he said.According to the Archbishop, the education system in government schools needs to be improved urgently. “Students get free mid-day meal and books and other facilities, except education in government schools,” he claimed.“I visit villages and I am of strong view that education system needs to be improved in government schools in Madhya Pradesh,” he added.The Church is observing Year of Consecrated Life as Pope Francis dedicated the period November 30, 2014 to February 2, 2016 for it. The objectives of this year is to look to the past with gratitude; live the present with passion and embrace the future with hope, he said.“We have been asked to work for spiritual upliftment and to set new trends in education, health care, social work, rehabilitation and work for the uplift and welfare of poor and oppressed classes with more strength and devotion,” the Archbishop added.
