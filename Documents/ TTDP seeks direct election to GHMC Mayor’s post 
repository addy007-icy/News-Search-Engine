The Telangana Telugu Desam Party has demanded that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) conduct direct election for the post of Mayor of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation if it is confident of winning the elections.TTDP working president A. Revanth Reddy expressed concern that indirect election to the Mayor’s post would give scope for horse trading and the ruling party could buy over corporators elected from opposition parties for securing the post.The TDP conducted direct elections to the Mayor’s post in the past, but that practice was set aside by the previous Congress government which opted for indirect elections to the coveted post.He criticised TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for hoodwinking the residents of Andhra origin with their claims on protecting their interests after bifurcation óf Andhra Pradesh and formation of separate Telangana State. He recalled how the TRS leadership threatened to remove the statues of Andhra leaders on Tank Bund and the manner in which the government tried to deny fee reimbursement facility to students of Andhra origin.The TRS was making false promises in view of the impending elections to the GHMC and people from other regions settled here should be cautious about the designs of the TRS leaders. Mr. Revanth Reddy took strong objection to IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s claims that Hyderabad was neglected by the previous governments. The credit for placing the State capital on the global map fully went to TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu, during his earlier stint as Chief Minister of the united State.The iconic Hi-Tec city and series of flyovers dotting the city were constructed during Mr. Naidu’s regime when the likes of Bill Gates and Bill Clinton visited the city.He dared Mr. Rama Rao to come for an open debate on the development of Hyderabad.
