It was an unusual day in Belagavi when the newly appointed employees of the Engineering Department of the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj took what was a sort of Hippocratic Oath against corruption and pledged to strive to use their academic knowledge and training for socio-economic advancement of society.The oath was taken in the presence of Sri Siddeshwar Swami of Jnana Yogashram, Vijayapura, and administered by Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patil at the “Sankalp Dina” organised by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj at the Central Hall of the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha here on Friday.The swamiji stressed that mere oath-taking for public consumption was not sufficient. Putting the oath into practice was the challenge and one must honour his oath, else all such oaths would turn meaningless.Mr. Patil, who distributed appointment letters to a few of them, said that 670 engineers, of which 472 are junior engineers, and 205 assistant engineers have been appointed in a transparent way. The selection of candidates was purely on merit basis. Those selected for the post of junior engineer had scored between 74 per cent and 90 per cent, while assistant engineers had recorded marks in the range of 86 per cent to 92 per cent.‘Work for society’s welfare’He told the appointees that they might have earlier criticised and mocked the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, Ministers, MPs, Legislators and government officials and expressed anger over their governance.But, “today, you are part of the same system and have been given an opportunity to prove your worth and cleanse the system for the welfare of society,” he added.Mr. Patil said that an upright official need not fear any politician; rather they should show enough courage to reject illegal and unethical requests from politicians or a contractor or a supplier with vested interests.State Warehouse Corporation Chairman A.G.S. Gaddadeveramath, Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee president, Belagavi, Shivangouda Patil, and Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation Department Commissioner M. Manjunath Nayak were present.
