Bhavanarayana Nagar, a remote residential colony near Sarpavaram in the city, is gearing up to host a training programme for farmers from all over the State, which is being conducted by the State government for the first time. Makeshift pandals, dais, residential quarters and toilets are being arranged on a war-footing for the training programme for farmers in zero-budget natural farming, taken up by the government in a prestigious manner.The eight-day programme will be launched on a grand scale on January 24 under the aegis of renowned agricultural scientist and natural farmer Subhash Palekar. Over 6,000 farmers including 1,500 women farmers will participate in the training programme to be held on the premises of Chaitanya Polytechnic near Bhavanarayana Swamy temple. Making agriculture more profitable by reducing the input costs is the theme of natural farming that turned successful in about 15 States including Punjab and Haryana.The day-long deliberations include the changes to be brought into cultivation by way of giving up the use of fertilizer and pesticides. Instead, the farmers will be encouraged to use natural fertilizers like animal dung and pesticides such as neem power and oil. “Till now, only non-government organisations that work for the farmers have hosted these training programmes. For the first time, the government of Andhra Pradesh has come forward to conduct this programme for the larger interests of the farmers in the long run,” says K. Dhanunjaya Reddy, Commissioner of Agriculture.The department has extended invitations to the progressive farmer organisations from the neighbouring States too and is ready to make arrangements like food and accommodation to any number of participants. “As of now, over 6,000 registrations have been completed,” says Mr. Reddy. M. Pavan Kumar, chief executive officer of the NGO Swadhikar and close associate of Mr. Palekar will coordinate the training sessions.“Accommodation will be arranged for the women farmers on the premises of Chaitanya Polytechnic, where the sessions will be conducted. Similarly, arrangements are also being made on the premises of St. Mary’s B.Ed. college for the male farmers and other guests,” says Joint Collector-II D. Markandeyulu. Over 240 bio-toilets are being arranged and 70 sanitation workers are being deputed to the venue to keep the premises clean round the clock. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is expected to participate in one of the sessions, while the Agriculture and Irrigation Ministers are expected to participate in the inaugural function.
