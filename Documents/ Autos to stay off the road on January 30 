Telangana Auto Drivers Joint Action Committee (TADJAC) has given a day long bandh call on January 30 to protest against the harassment of traffic police in the city. Mohd Amanullah Khan, convenor, TADJAC charged that the traffic police are indiscriminately penalising the auto drivers and collecting thousands of rupees as penalty. The traffic police are misusing their powers and randomly clicking photographs of auto rickshaws if they stop to drop passengers and are sending e-challans, forcing the auto rickshaw drivers to approach private money lenders, he alleged.The traffic police should instead get back to the old concept of spot challans and discontinue the e-challan concept.Mr. Khan asked all auto drivers to participate in the strike and make it a success.
