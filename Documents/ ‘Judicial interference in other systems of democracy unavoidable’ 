The judiciary is interfering in duties of other organs of democracy in an unavoidable situation. And it should not be considered as encroachment of functions of other organs, according to Supreme Court judge N.V. Ramana.The apex court judge released a book titled, Gnapakalam , a collection of thoughts, diaries and opinions of friends of senior advocate Kanthamneni Ravindra Rao, here on Sunday.Addressing the gathering, he said, the three organs—judiciary, legislative and executive -- were supposed to perform their own task without interfering in the domain of each other. But, the judiciary cannot keep quiet if someone knocks at its doors seeking justice. The judiciary cannot tell the aggrieved persons that their problem/grievance would not come under its ambit.A takeover of the functions of or interference in another organ of democracy should not be construed as over-reach or encroachment. In unavoidable conditions, the judiciary was interfering in the duties of other systems of democracy, he said, adding, “There is a danger that the unconstitutional elements will fill the void if any organ was not discharging its duty in an expected manner.”Recalling his association with Mr. Ravindra Rao, the apex court judge said that the advocate was down to earth personality. The people love and praise him from bottom of their hearts for his dedication to the profession and ethical values.
