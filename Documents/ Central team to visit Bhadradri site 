An expert team from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) is set to inspect the project site for Bhadradri Thermal Power Station in Manuguru of Khammam district on Saturday, in view of allegations about violation of environmental laws by the project proponent Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TSGENCO).The visit has been scheduled following a complaint filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), holding the MoEF as the first respondent for the violations.As per sources, the complainant organisation Human Rights Forum (HRF) had also written another strongly worded letter to the Ministry about the violations at the site, which has spurred the visit.Tribunal orderResponding to the petition by HRF, the tribunal had earlier ordered TSGENCO to stop the work if the project lacked environmental clearance (EC) as alleged.Representatives from the second respondent, the State Pollution Control Board, had confirmed that the EC for the project was yet to be obtained.In its petition, HRF had alleged that the company was going ahead with construction, armed with nothing but Terms of Reference (ToR), even while existing laws obligated it to obtain EC after duly conducting public hearing.EC for the project had run into trouble when the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) under MoEF had asked the TSGENCO to obtain permission from the Ministry of Power for use of sub-critical technology.The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) guidelines advise use of only super-critical technology for thermal plants for reasons of fuel efficiency and environment conservation.The HRF petition mentioned violation of three laws, namely Environment Act, Air Act and Water Act.Also alleging that the company continued with the construction work in violation of the orders by NGT, representatives from HRF said contempt of court proceedings were being initiated against the company.Next hearing by the tribunal is scheduled on January 13.The visit has been scheduled following a complaint filed before the National Green Tribunal
