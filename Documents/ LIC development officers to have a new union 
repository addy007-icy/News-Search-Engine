The All-India Insurance Development Officers’ Association (AIIDOO) has alleged that the development officers in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) are facing discrimination and sought steps to address the issue.Addressing presspersons here on Saturday prior to the formal launch of the Dharwad division unit of the organisation, N.A. Kittur, former State secretary of the BJP Minority Morcha; Ashok Mishra, general secretary of AIDOO, Gorakhpur; and Sanjay Hooli, vice-president of the Dharwad Division of AIDOO, said that the existing trade union had not made efforts to raise the issues concerning them.Mr. Kittur said that the development officers could be terminated from service as per the existing law if they failed to meet the target.“We are not saying that there should not be any step against officials failing to meet their targets. But terminating their service is ‘draconian’,” he said.Mr. Kittur said that their main demand was that the termination clause should be done away with and development officers should get wage revision benefits like other employees and officials of LIC without attaching any rider. He said that roughly 25 per cent of LIC employees were development officers.“While other employees get all benefits, development officers are required to work even on holidays and female officers are forced to work even during their months of pregnancy,” he said.
