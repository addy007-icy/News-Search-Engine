After a massive rescue operation the Army has recovered the body of a civilian porter who accidentally fell in a 200 feet crevasse on the Northern Siachen glacier. The porter fell in the crevasse on February 27. This comes close to the incident last month > when 10 soldiers were killed after an avalanche buried their camp at 19,600 feet.Army officials said that rescue operations by specialised teams were launched immediately after the incident and continued unabated. The teams had to progressively descend to depths of 60 feet and 90 feet and cut through frozen ice to eventually reach a depth of 130 feet where the mortal remains of the porter were located.This year has been particularly bad for the Army as 14 lives were lost on the glacier in just two months.
