: Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s decision to seek public opinion before implementing the next instalment of the odd-even scheme.Citizens can now forward suggestions — ranging from when to launch the scheme, how long to enforce it and, most significantly, whether or not they were in favour of the implementation of a scheme on a rotational basis every month or ‘forever’.Mr. Kejriwal announced the decision at two different events. The first time while he was presiding over state-level Republic Day celebrations where he stated that the government will hold 'jan sabhas' or public meetings at each Assembly Constituency to decide when to enforce the next instalment of the vehicle-rationing plan.Speaking to the media at the Delhi Secretariat later in the day, the CM said his government had put a mechanism in place to seek such suggestions from the people even as he lauded them for making the desperate anti-pollution measure 'a success'.“Odd-even was a success because we took suggestions of people into consideration and incorporated them. So we are launching a structured plan inviting people’s suggestions on the idea from Tuesday,” Mr. Kejriwal said.“An email address dedicated to the cause has been launched; it will be followed by a helpline where citizens can give suggestions ranging from when they want the next instalment of the scheme to be enforced, for how long as well as who should figure on the list of exemptions,” he added.According to the CM, while those willing to provide suggestions could currently send them across onoddevenidea@gmail.com, an IVR-based helpline dedicated for the purpose would follow in the days to come.A senior transport official said the move follows a brainstorming session where suggestions aimed at laying to rest speculation about the future enforcement of the scheme were sought.In fact, at a closed interaction with the media over the weekend, Transport Minister Gopal Rai had hinted that the government was readying to put a similar measure in place in the wake of feedback related to dissatisfaction with ‘a long list of driver categories’ exempted from the provisions of the scheme.Suggestions will also be sought on who should be included in the exemption list
