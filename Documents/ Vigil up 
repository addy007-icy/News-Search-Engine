Quite aware that Sankranti is the period when illicit liquor traders are most active, the Excise Department sources have claimed that they stepped up vigilance. A massive drive will also be launched from the month-end against those indulging in dilution of IMFL, brand mixing ( lower category liquor packed into higher category brand).The vigilance has resulted in cancellation of a few licensed shops in East Godavari, Prakasam, and Kadapa for dilution of IMFL. Similarly action was initiated against a shop in Vijayawada for brand mixing. Though ID liquor is still a menace, thanks to stepped up vigilance, the excise revenue went up by 14 per cent in the last two months, official sources said.
