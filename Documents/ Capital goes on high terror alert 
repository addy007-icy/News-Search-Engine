: Police stations in Delhi have been ordered to keep aside sufficient staff as anti-terrorist reserve in order to respond in an eventuality of a terror attack in the Capital.Letters to this effect have been issued to all police stations and senior officers of every district. “Each member of these anti-terrorist reserves must be equipped with arms at all times and special transport facility should be kept ready to respond at the earliest,” a senior police officer told The Hindu .In addition, all static police personnel have been instructed to keep their guns inside their holsters at all time so that valuable time is not lost in collecting weapons in the scenario of a terror attack.All station house officers are expected to revert on a daily basis to senior officers about these arrangements so that the number of reserve personnel, weapons and transport facilities to deal with terror emergencies can be estimated.All the SHOs have also been assigned with the task of checking the status of all CCTV cameras, whether private or government, under their area’s jurisdiction.“Each of those CCTV cameras has to be manually checked to see how many of them are in a working condition and why the rest of them are not working. We need realistic reports on by when the non-functional cameras would be in working condition again,” said the officer.“Since it is the local police that are the first to respond to an emergency call, the duty officer at every police station must have maps showing all possible entries and exits from the buildings, the stairs, lifts, parking spaces, etc,” the officer said.The Capital has been placed on high alert ever since the Pathankot terror attack when the Delhi Police received inputs that two Jaish-e-Mohammad militants may have sneaked into Delhi.Unprecedented security measures have also been planned for the Republic Day parade when the terror threat perception is at its peak.A total of 100 companies, comprising around one lakh paramilitary and police personnel, will be pressed into service to ensure security for the celebrations, which will have the French President François Hollande as the chief guest.When Barack Obama visited last year, 95 companies guarded the Capital.Static police personnel have been instructed to keep their guns inside their holsters at all times
