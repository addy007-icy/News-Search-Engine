Political parties including Congress and CPI had a field day criticising Chief Ministers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, K. Chandrasekhar Rao and N. Chandrababu Naidu, for not visiting University of Hyderabad (UoH) even when student protests were rocking the campus for long.Addressing the gathering, former Union Minister S. Jaipal Reddy asked: “How can a Chief Minister sit idle and watch when hundreds of students in his capital are on campus protesting”.Mr. Reddy added that BJP had no right to refer to certain actions as anti-national.“Since when did anti-nationalism become their forte? If I were to say that the promise the country made to Yakub Memon when they brought him here should have been honoured. Will I become anti-national?” he asked, adding how a Chief Minister can shy away from injustice.Mr. Reddy demanded that the Chief Minister of Telangana should intervene immediately and resolve the issue on the campus.Meanwhile, both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee leaders, who were in the campus, demanded both Mr. Rao and Mr. Naidu to come to the university and address the students. “When national leaders are coming to the city to address the students, the two Chief Ministers have gone missing,” said N. Raghuveera Reddy, APCC president.Geeta Reddy, former Minister, demanded stepping down of both the Union Ministers. K. Narayana of CPI asked whether the two Chief Ministers were engaged in “more important work than others”, adding all the culprits should be brought to book.
