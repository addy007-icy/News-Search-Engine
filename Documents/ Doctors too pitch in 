Public transport, two-wheelers and car-sharing was the order of the day for those wanting to reach various hospitals for appointments, follow-up programmes and employees of medical establishments. Vehicles ferrying people to hospitals were exempt from the odd-even formula, though some doctors did complain about “problems reaching the workplace”.Pankaj Solanki, a physician at a Delhi government hospital, said: “Sharing transport was the only way out and most of us helped each other in order to adhere to the scheme. Doctors work in shifts and it is difficult to follow the new scheme, though we all should try to do so in order to ensure we stay healthy.”Senior doctor Somesh Mittal said public transport in Delhi may be under pressure due to unavoidable rush, but Delhiites should help each other reach the larger goal of a clean and green Delhi.Meanwhile, in order to curb pollution, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) is planning to give an interest-free loan to its employees willing to buy hybrid/electric vehicles.“The benefits of such cars are that they have lesser emission and are fuel efficient. In addition to this, FEHI is planning to extend financial support and interest-free loans to its employees to help convert their vehicles to CNG. This will take care of financial barriers and encourage more employees to switch to greener modes of transportation.”FEHI is also launching vehicles for “last-mile connectivity” for employees to make trips from the nearest metro stations to the hospital to support the cause of environment. Also, CNG buses will run on various routes to pick up and drop employees.Vehicles ferrying people to hospitals were exempt from the odd-even formula
