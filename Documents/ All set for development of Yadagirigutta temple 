The development works of Sri Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple at Yadagirigutta are likely to be taken up soon with the design and plan in place. About 250 acres has been acquired for the purpose too, said Chief Secretary Rajiv Sharma.Addressing mediapersons here on Saturday, the Chief Secretary said that the outlay for temple development was put at Rs. 800 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. Some of the works related to temple development work have already been grounded and the tender process was on for developing the 250 acres land acquired by the YTDA (Yadagirigutta Temple Development Authority) down the hill and demolition and reconstruction of temple and other structures on the hill.When questioned whether the works would be grounded before the scheduled Brahmotsavams and other Utsavams in sub-temples in February, he said that they have discussed the issue in today’s meeting. “We will take a call on that shortly. The work should not create any hurdles to the visiting devotees,” he informed. Even if we take up demolition work, Mr. Sharma said that they would make alternate arrangements for pilgrims. Temple Architect, Anand Sai explained about the design of the temple, while YTDA, Chairman, G. Kishan, District Collector P. Satyanarayana Reddy, Executive Officer N. Geetha explained about the progress of various works to Mr. Sharma. He inspected all the places on the hill while discussing about the plan with officers, architect and priests. Joint Collector, N.Satyanarayan and others were present.
