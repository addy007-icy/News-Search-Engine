Lakshmi Parthasarathy Athreya, trained in the Vazhuvoor bani under Chitra Visweswaran, began her recital with an anjali in Gambheeranattai, adi, the music of which was composed by her guru.Lakshmi’s traditional Nachiyar Kauthuvam in Nattai eulogised Andal. With this, she struck a rapport with the audience. She selected Swati Thirunal’s ‘Anjaneya Raghurama duta’ as her piece-de-resistance, rather than a varnam with the nayika pining for her beloved.Vocalist Murali Parthasarathy poured out the feelings of the bhakta, which enhanced the beauty of the piece. Speaking about devotion and faith, the bhakta, seeks the protection of Anjaneya.Through mudras, postures and apt sancharis, she described the deeds of Hanuman. It was a treat to watch Lakshmi’s portrayal of Anjaneya setting Lanka ablaze. Perfect aramandis coupled with jatis were rendered with precision, with Vijay Madhavan (nattuvangam) and Venkatasubramaniam (mridangam) keeping the beat. The applause underlined appreciation. The padam performed was an extract from Kulashekara Azhwar’s Devaki Pulambal, composed by the late R. Visweswaran, it incorporated quite a few ragas — Neelambari, Kapi, Charukesi and Rasikapriya in misra chapu.It tells the poignant tale of Devaki, the real mother of Krishna, who could not experience motherhood. Lakshmi was at her best in portraying this fine piece of abhinaya.Tillana in Vallachi ended the recital with everyone filled with positive energy and aesthetic bliss.
