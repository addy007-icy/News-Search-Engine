A group of conned depositors have complained at Aska police station in Ganjam district of Odisha alleging that a West Bengal based dubious financial firm had cheated around Rs. 3 crore from different parts of Ganjam district.These depositors preferred to approach police when they confirmed that there was little chance to get back their hard earned money deposited with the dubious firm. As per the report given to the police, on June 29, the firm had opened up its office at Aska. It had appointed agents in different rural pockets of Ganjam district to collect deposits from gullible depositors.Several persons were attracted by lucrative deposit schemes and high interest rate of this dubious firm. This firm had promised to double fixed deposits in four and half years and to provide over 16 per cent annual interest on other deposits. But later this firm had closed down its office and vanished.
