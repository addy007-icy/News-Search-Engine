Subbulakshmi, Co-Optex as a tribute to her has rolled out silk saris in 25 unique patterns that the singer had worn during her concerts, according to the Co-optex Managing Director T.N. Venkatesh.In an interaction with The Hindu here on Wednesday, Mr. Venkatesh said the Co-optex Design Studios in Chennai had hired expert designers trained at the National Institute of Designs to focus on the urban clients and customers by attracting them with combinations and patterns involving pastel shades, zero zari silk saris and combining two or more traditional silk weaving centre novelties.The zero zari silk sari with threaded work has become a hit with the upmarket customers and working professionals who prefer elegance with simplicity. Since most saris are double jacquard woven, they stand out for their durability, appeal, and utility, Mr. Venkatesh said.With the Co-optex focusing on silk as well, silk alone accounted for Rs. 4 crore during the last Deepavali season sale, up from Rs. 1.90 crore the previous year.Plans are afoot to produce exclusive silk salwars and paavadais to increase the product range in the Co-optexâ€™s bouquet.The Co-optex is supporting more than two lakh handloom weavers throughout the State who have been organised under 1,180 weavers cooperative societies by channelling them various governmental benefits.The exposure visit of weavers in the Co-optex fold to other major traditional weaving centres has resulted in the rise of a new brand of saris involving the best of those cultures.In silk variety, the Tamil Nadu weavers are blending Nuapatra (Odisha) motifs and in cotton items, they are dovetailing the Chirala (Andhra Pradesh) patterns and the blended varieties are a real hit with the customers, Mr. Venkatesh added.
