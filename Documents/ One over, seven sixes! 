Recently, Pranav Dhanawade, a Mumbai lad, created a record of sorts in an inter-school cricket tournament by scoring 1,009 runs in 327 balls (59 sixes and 129 fours).Pranav’s feat attracted the attention of many.Almost during the same period, a 19-year-old from the port city created a record by hitting seven sixes in one over (including one no ball) in a private tournament, to break records of sixes in an over.Gulfaam Gulrez Saleh belted a medium pacer all around the ACA-VDCA ‘B’ ground for 35 runs in an over and completed the match in just four overs.It was a tournament with 10 overs a side. The opposition scored 80. Gulfaam, who opened the innings, hit the seven sixes in the fourth over to complete his quick fire 50 and the match.Earlier in the season, in an ‘A’ division league match of the Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association, the budding cricketer belted a medium pacer of Visakhapatnam Port Trust for five consecutive sixes.“I wanted to emulate Yuvaraj Singh in the match against the VPT, but was caught at the boundary line in the last ball of the over,” he said.The young lad overcame an illness in the early years and became a top athlete in school and college.Apart from cricket, which is his favourite sport, he is into playing volleyball, table tennis, shuttle badminton, and golf.“But cricket is my passion and love,” he said.He idolises the legendary Sachin Tendulkar and models his game like the South African great AB de Villiers.“In limited over cricket, AB de Villiers is the king today and I would like to shape up like him,” said Gulfaam.He dreams first to get into the State Ranji team and then move on to an IPL side.
