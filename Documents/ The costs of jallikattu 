I am concerned about the economic consequences of holding the jallikattu on an annual basis. No one has talked about the injuries — serious and minor — sustained both by persons taking active part in the sport and the spectators. Governments need to look at what it costs the health and support systems to attend to the persons injured. I strongly suggest that the State government provide information on what assistance it has provided to those who have sustained injuries so far. Further, what are the net economic costs to the government in continuing to hold the sport on a long-term basis? What percentage of people enjoy this ‘sport’ in Tamil Nadu or the rest of the country?I am an Australian citizen of Indian origin and am shocked at the undue importance given by many political parties in continuing this dangerous sport with no concern for human life. Finally, is this sport getting unusual support now from various political parties only because of the forthcoming elections in Tamil Nadu?Rajagopal Narayanan,Chadstone, Australia
