Occupation: Makes handmade murukkuI don’t remember how long I have been making murukku. I am 60 now and have been doing this since childhood. I got hooked to it after seeing my paternal grandmother making the crisp savoury. She was an expert and I remember watching in awe as she swirled the dough with ease. She ran it as a family business while staying at Killippalam. There were a lot of takers for the murukku she made. Now my father’s sister and her children are carrying on the business.I got married at the age of 17 and after that I started making murukku on daily wage basis at various shops. At this shop at Eenchakkal also I am working on daily wages. Before coming here I used to work at a shop near Vedivachankovil.I commute daily from my house at Nalanchira to reach here by 9.30 a.m. There is no fixed working hours; if there is a big order I work till 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. On somedays I leave early. There are two other women working here at this shop. In addition to murukku, the shop sells pakkavada, cheeda (kaliyadakka), munthirikothu, achappam, thenkuzhal and karachevu. My employer, Subramania Pillai, also gets eats such as jilebi, laddu, banana chips and mixture made at his home for sale at this shop. However I make only murukku. In fact I make them on the achu and the frying part is done by another employee.A murukku costs Rs. 7. Sometimes we get order to make bigger murukkus and they cost Rs. 12 each. Let me tell you how we make it. The dough has raw rice flour and urad dal (uzhunnu) flour to which we add sesame, cumin, omam (carom seeds) and salt. The dough should have the right consistency so that it doesn’t stick to the hand while I swirl it on the achu. Well, perfect swirls come with practice. It is then fried in oil.It has to be cooked properly in oil so that it gets the right colour and turns out crisp. It is not good to fry it in oil for too long.We make murukku of 10 kg rice everyday. We have a lot of regular customers in this area.The shop gets bulk orders as well, such as for functions in connection with marriages and so on.I also go to houses to make murukku when there is a marriage or birthday.It might sound strange, I personally don’t like murukku (laughs). May be because I have been seeing it being made ever since I could remember. I don’t feel like tasting it at all. But I enjoy eating other snacks.This shop is open on all days. But I can take leave if I need. I stay with my son Girish, his wife, Lakshmi, and their two children. My daughter, Geetha, stays with her husband. This job has been earning me enough after I lost my husband. I have no complaints and hope to continue working as long as I can.(A weekly column on men and women who make Thiruvananthapuram what it is)
