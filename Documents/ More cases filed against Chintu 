The Chittoor police on Monday night booked criminal cases against Chandrasekhar alias Chintu (prime accused in the Chittoor mayor couple murder case), and three others under sections (IPC) 420, 384 and 109 (read with section 34), for allegedly cheating and intimidating several women in connection with money-lending business.According to the police, Pavani, a resident of SBI Colony in Chittoor town, was involved in borrowing gold ornaments from gullible people and mortgaging them with private finance companies. During the last two years, the woman opened close to 300 accounts in private finance firms, having mortgaged 7.9 kg of gold jewellery. Several families in Chittoor and Srikalahasti, who had given gold jewellery to Pavani, asked her to return their material. In this backdrop, Pavani approached Chintu (a few months before the double murder of mayor couple) and reportedly sought his help in intimidating women.The police said a few days before the murder of the mayor couple, Chintu had allegedly sent away Pavani from Chittoor town and himself visiting her after the crime.
