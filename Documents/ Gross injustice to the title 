Film: Malgudi DaysStarring: Anoop Menon, Vishal, JanakiDirection: Vishal, Vivek, VinodNothing could be more misleading about the movie Malgudi Days than its title.It’s still a mystery how the makers got the rights to use that name for a movie which does not have anything to do with R.K. Narayan’s collection of short stories. The film here gets that name from a school, around which the story is set.Two children, one stranger with a mysterious past, a school located at a misty hill resort – Malgudi Days starts off with an interesting premise reminiscent of those adventure stories from school days.Young Athena (Janaki), in depression after a personal tragedy, is put in a residential school away from home. There, she strikes up an unlikely friendship with the school bully Milan (Vishal). The two of them comes across an injured man (Anoop Menon) at an abandoned building in the school’s backyard.The end credits tell us that it is inspired from the real story of a girl getting locked up accidentally inside a school building a few years back in Nagaland.To spice up things a bit, the writers seemed to have brought in the side plot of the mystery man. The two plot lines do not have much of a bearing on each other, until they are brought together forcibly towards the end.In between, we have the usual fillers like the goofy watchmen, strict principal and parents fretting over their wards. The ‘Maoist’ side plot hardly fits in with the rest of the film.The movie redeems a bit in the last half an hour, with some gripping scenes of the children caught inside the hostel. Still, there’s hardly anything here to excite the young ones in the audience, who are the main target of this film.S.R. Praveen
