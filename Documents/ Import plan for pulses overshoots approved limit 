To stabilise the prices of pulses that remain high at Rs. 180 a kg, the Centre is planning to import over and above the recently-approved 10,000 tonnes, sources said.Last month, the government had approved a proposal to import 5,000 tonnes each of urad and tur dal. It had also decided to extend till September 2016 the zero import duty on masoor and chickpeas.“Ten thousand tonnes is too little for what we actually consume,” an official said, adding that such interventions are justified as it is meant to stabilise the market.
