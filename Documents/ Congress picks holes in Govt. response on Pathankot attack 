The Congress on Monday picked holes in the BJP-led NDA government’s response to the Pathankot terror attack, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of weakening “the institutional mechanism” that could have proved handy to tackle the security threat emanating from Pakistan.Though Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s reaction to the terror strike was a measured one, the party spokesperson, Ajay Maken, came out all guns blazing against the Modi government.In view of the 48-hour long gun battle between the Indian armed forces and the terrorists, Ms. Gandhi expressed her concern “for the safety of families as also strategic assets of Air Force,” and hoped that the government “is taking all necessary steps to neutralize the terror threats besides ensuring adequate security of citizens and strategic assets.”Taking a tougher line, Mr. Maken said Prime Minister Modi is yet to respond on why the intelligence reports were ignored and the intrusion wasn’t neutralised ahead of time.“Despite specific input having been provided by none less than the abducted SP of Punjab Police, how did terrorists managed to enter our frontline air-force base and wreak havoc?” asked Mr.Maken.Mr. Maken criticised Mr. Modi for “propagating yoga” in Karnataka at the time Indian armed forces were fighting with the terrorists. “The Cabinet Committee on Security did not meet even once to take stock of the situation over the last three days,” he said.Mr. Maken also said the contradiction seen in the statements of various union ministers suggests that there is “complete disharmony” between the political leadership of the country.
