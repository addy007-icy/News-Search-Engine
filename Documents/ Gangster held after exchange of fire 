Before he was eventually arrested after an exchange of heavy fire on Thursday, alleged gangster Inaam had made the Delhi Police travel across States searching for him. Inaam was wanted in a kidnapping case of a Gujarati businessman from Old Delhi Railway Station last February and the police had even declared a reward on his head.Inspector Shiv Kumar who led the team that arrested Inaam from Uttar Pradesh’s Hathia village said that at least four times, they had a tip off about Inaam’s location but the raids remained unsuccessful as he had managed to give them the slip on each occasion.“We first learnt that he was in West Bengal but before we could reach there, he escaped. In August last year, we were again told that he was hiding in a mosque in Jehangirpuri but again he was alerted and managed to flee. We were keeping him under technical surveillance and zeroed his next hideout at a madrasa in Mehrauli but the result of the raid this time round also was not in our favour,” said the officer who led 26 men to Hathia village.The Special Cell then started developing information regarding the case.“Sources were deployed in and around Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. A special team was constituted to track him down. The team was able to extract information that Inam was hiding in village Hathiya and received a specific input that the Inaam accompanied by 5-6 persons was planning to move towards Rajasthan in a Tata Sumo,” said Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Arvind Deep.Those in the vehicle opened fire on the joint team of UP and Delhi Police and they retaliated eventually overpowering and arresting Inaam, said Mr. Deep.The police had to endure resistance from a lot of villagers as well who assembled there. “Soon after that, a large crowd gathered and assaulted the teams with lathis and also pelted stones but we managed to overcome the challenge with the help of more reinforcement coming from UP police,” said Mr. Kumar.A special team was constituted to track him downArvind DeepSpecial Commissioner of Police (Special Cell)
