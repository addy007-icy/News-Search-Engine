Road users crossing the Kulavanigarpuram manned level crossing here on Tuesday evening had a miraculous escape as one of the two steel gates broke even as it was being lowered.When the Tiruchendur â€“ Tirunelveli passenger train was about to cross this busy manned level crossing around 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, the gatekeeper lowered the steel gates. Even as it was coming down slowly, the steel gate at the northern side crashed down. As no vehicle was hastily crossing the level crossing when the mishap occurred, none was injured.The traffic police constable, who would be regulating vehicular traffic near the level crossing came to the spot and fastened the steel chain across the road to ensure safe passage of the train.As the steel gate crashed down during busy hours, more than two hundred vehicles were left stranded on both sides of the level crossing, much to the agony of the children returning home from schools and ambulances carrying patients. However, the heavy traffic congestion was cleared after the precariously clinging gate was removed following a 30-minute-long struggle.Maintenance work at this railway gate was carried out only on August 2 last during which the tracks were strengthened with blue metal and gates got checked. However, the mishap has brought to light the quality of work done during the maintenance.
