The rather bland walls of buildings in Lodhi Colony have been getting a makeover, with artists using them as a canvas to turn the colony into India’s first Public Art District.The area has seen a lot of changes, with Meherchand Market that borders it becoming a space for chic boutiques and cafes, and the artwork on the walls giving the area a character of its own.On a winter afternoon, Australian aboriginal artist Reko Rennie finished adding the final touches to a bright geometric painting he has been working on for a week as part of the Street Art Festival, that seeks to change the façade of the city under the Swachh Bharat campaign.Reko is an interdisciplinary artist who gives a contemporary urban twist to explore his Aboriginal identity through various mediums. At the wall in Lodhi Colony, he uses a bright pink background to paint a diamond geometric pattern, which is his “family coat of arms”, a little bit of his tradition that he has left behind. The vibrant work of art never fails to catch the eyes of passersby.Speaking about street art, Reko says there is a need to bring art and incorporate it into the public space and make it available to an audience that is different from the typical gallery clientele.“People have been making markings on the wall for centuries. This is just a newer interpretation of the age-old tradition to bring it into the urban space.”Reko says it has been a pleasure collaborating with local artists as well. He says the area residents appreciate his effort to transform the surrounding and give it a new lease of life visually.Since the work is part of the Swachh Bharat initiative, Reko hopes people will respect it and hopefully refrain from defacing it or urinating on it. Some of the other works in the area, done barely a year ago, unfortunately have seen numerous political posters being stuck over them.Lodhi Colony resident Anil Kumar said at first everyone was wondering what these international artists were up to, as some of the works are very different from what we are used to seeing, but then everyone got used to them. “It is better than having political posters plastered on the walls.”The St+Art India Foundation is organising the Street Art Festival in collaboration with the Ministry of Urban Development.It is inviting acclaimed street artists from India and across the world to convert Lodhi Colony, as a pilot project, into an Urban Art District and will also adopts least four more such districts in other urban Indian cities by 2020.
