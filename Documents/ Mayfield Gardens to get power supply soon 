Residents of Mayfield Gardens will soon have proper electricity connections as the Punjab and Haryana High Court has passed an order directing the builders and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) to create necessary infrastructure within three months.Once the electrical infrastructure is in place, the DHBVN will release the electricity connections to the residents of Mayfield Gardens, subject to fulfilment of other conditions required for the purpose.The builders shall provide all necessary infrastructure within the colony developed by it, which shall be completed within a period of two and a half months.It has also been made clear that rest of the infrastructure has to be provided by DHBVN at its own cost.The DHBVN is permitted to incur the necessary expenditure. The dispute regarding the liability to bear the cost for providing infrastructure, as has been raised by the counsel for the DHBVN, shall be considered separately in the writ petitions filed by the builders where the issue sought to be raised is -- who is responsible for providing internal and external infrastructure for the supply of electricity.In case, the builders fail in writ petitions filed by them, which are pending for hearing on May 24, they will not be permitted to raise any dispute regarding the cost of the infrastructure provided by DHBVN.The court verdict has brought relief to more than 3,000 families in three different colonies of the township which are deprived of regular electricity connections because of the alleged failure of the developers to put in place adequate electrical infrastructure as per the norms. They are totally dependent on generators and inverters for power supply.The residents are paying through the nose and the arrangement is also harming the environment with over 3,000 litre of diesel being used daily to maintain the power supply.
