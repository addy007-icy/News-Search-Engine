Police seized four country bombs kept in an abandoned carton found near Keezhanatham intersection on Bypass Road here on Tuesday night.When a patrol team, led by Sub-Inspector of Police Vimalan, found the abandoned carton on the roadside near Keezhanatham intersection, it alerted Assistant Commissioner of Police (Palayamkottai) G.S. Madhavan and Inspector of Police Thillai Nagarajan.Imediately, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad rushed to the spot and defused the explosives that were reportedly of “low intensity”.Around 3.30 p.m. on Wednesday, Police Control Room here received an anonymous call, and the caller warned that bombs planted in Perumal temples in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai would go off shortly. While a police team tried to establish the identity of the caller, who had made the call from a coin-box phone in Tirunelveli Town, six teams were involved in checking Perumal temples in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai. “It was a hoax call. We did not find any explosives during the search,” said a police officer.
