The postponement was as per mandatory rules of business and to get the Law Department’s opinion. The next Cabinet decided not to renew the licences and the complainant, the Kerala Bar Hotel Association (KBHA), has no case that it got a favourable decision in reciprocation for the bribe it allegedly gave. The allegation that KBHA officials had handed over Rs.15 lakh to Mr. Mani at his private residence in Pala on March 22, 2014, was full of holes. Saju Dominic, who supposedly handed over the bribe money to one John Kallat at the Minister’s house, was at Ponkunnam, 24 km away, at the time. The trail of digital mobile phone evidence left behind by the alleged bribe-givers disproved their contention that they all had met at a public place on the evening of April 1, 2014, to collect Rs.35 lakh to be paid to Mr. Mani at his official residence early next day. A forensic metadata analysis showed the “bribe givers” were at different locations at the time. KBHA president Rajkumar Unni had arrived at the Minister’s residence at 6.55 a.m. on April 2. But there was no evidence that he had met or bribed the Minister. The guard register showed that he had left five minutes later. There was no time for his driver to go out a second time to collect the bribe money from a nearby location as alleged.Director, VACB, N. Sankar Reddy had written three letters to the investigating officer, R. Sukeshan asking him to re-verify aspects in key witness’s statements. His communications are part of the case diary. The officer found no evidence to prosecute Mr. Mani and asked the Director’s sanction to drop all “further action” against the Minister. The 90-page final report would be submitted in court soon.
