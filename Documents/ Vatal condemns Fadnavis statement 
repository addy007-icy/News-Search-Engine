Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha leader Vatal Nagaraj staged a protest in the city on Sunday condemning the reported statement of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that Belagavi and Karwar should be acceded to that State.He flayed the statements of Mr. Fadnavis and the recommendations of the Mahajana Commission on the issue.The Karnataka government should take such statements seriously and brace up for a long legal haul in the Supreme Court as Maharashtra had petitioned in the apex court challenging the commission’s report, he added.“The Maharashtra Ekikarna Samiti was being supported by the Maharashtra government and its members were harassing local people on border areas. The government should take note of it and book such elements and extern them from the State,” Mr. Nagaraj said.He also expressed concern over the reported closure of Kannada schools in Talvadi of Tamil Nadu and said the authorities should take up the issue.Mr. Nagaraj urged the government to give emphasis on development of the backward regions in the border areas of the State.
