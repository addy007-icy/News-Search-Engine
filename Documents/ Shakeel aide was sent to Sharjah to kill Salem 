Syed Abbas Tublani, arrested recently for allegedly plotting to attack a city-based journalist, was sent to Sharjah in 1999 to kill Abu Salem, police sources revealed on Tuesday.“In 1998, Abu Salem, who used to work for the Kaskar gang, parted ways with Dawood to set up his own gang. A year later, Tublani fled to Dubai and started working as a driver for Anees. Tublani’s interrogation revealed that the same year, Anees ordered him to hunt down Salem, who was in Sharjah at the time, and kill him,” said a Crime Branch officer.Tublani has allegedly admitted that he started inquiries in Sharjah to find out Salem’s whereabouts. However, he only got as far as finding Fazl-ur Rehman, Salem’s aide who was also based in Sharjah.“Tublani tracked Rehman and demanded that he reveal Salem’s whereabouts. Rehman dismissively told him to leave him alone. The confrontation turned violent but Rehman did not yield in.Tublani ultimately had to flee to avoid attracting attention and came back to Dubai empty handed,” the officer said.Tublani was arrested on December 31 last year by the Anti Extortion Cell of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch in connection with the threats received by journalist S Balakrishnan.Further investigations revealed that Tublani was an important figure in 1993 bomb blasts accused Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar’s gang. The term ‘driver’, in underworld parlance, signifies duties beyond driving a high ranking criminal’s car.A gangster’s driver is also entrusted with doing important jobs for the master, and the police said that Tublani’s standing in the gang hierarchy was no different.The Crime Branch is now focusing on Tublani’s activities after he came back to India, to check whether he has committed any more crimes at the behest of Dawood or his right hand man Shakeel Babumiyan Sheikh alias Chhhota Shakeel.Tublani was allegedly in direct contact with Shakeel and the instructions to attack Mr Balakrishnan, according to the police, were issued personally by Shakeel.Crime Branch focusing on Tublani’s activities after he came back to India
