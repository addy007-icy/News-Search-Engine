Baldia voters won’t keep quiet if their leaders don’t listen to them. They are likely use WhatsApp to make or break their leaders in this GHMC elections.A message being circulated on WhatsApp and attributed to BJP MLA from Goshamahal, Raja Singh – known for his sharp remarks on religious and political issues – is being cited as an example. The message in the form of an audio file was shared by thousands in the city.The file was described as a telephonic conversation purportedly made by the MLA with an employee of the Revenue Department following the request of a voter of the constituency.A resident rang up the legislator requesting him to tell the Revenue officials, who were objecting to drilling bore-well in his house, not to interfere in the matter.“The voice is similar to that of Raja Singh. He is heard asking the voter to give the phone to the Revenue employee. Then, he tells him to impose whatever fine amount is prescribed for such illegal action,” a person who shared the audio file said. Since the voter had call recording application in his smart-phone, the conversation was recorded.He shared it with one of his friends and soon it went viral among different WhatsApp groups. Some TV news channels even telecast special stories on the issue. “This legislator’s audio file is an isolated case, but it signals the possibility of such messenger services playing crucial role in the civic body election campaign,” says Raju, aspiring to contest from Alwal as corporator.When the Baldia elections were held seven years ago, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were already launched.“They were just becoming popular with the sharp rise in user base, but were not extensively used either by voters or leaders for election campaign,” Ravi, a software professional, said.The scene completely changed by the turn of 2014 when Telangana Assembly elections were held, with everyone trying to make use of Facebook and Twitter to gain upper hand over the opponents. In between, WhatsApp – a free online messenger service via mobile phones – emerged as yet another powerful platform.It was being given a shape by its founders in the US during the previous GHMC elections. In these seven years, the messenger service witnessed an explosive growth with almost every smart-phone user becoming a member of one or the other group in WhatsApp.A file described as a telephonic conversation reportedly made by BJP MLA Raja Singh with an employee of the Revenue Department is being circulated by many
