The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy against two Gujarat-based private firms and others for allegedly causing a loss of Rs.38.53 crore to the Union Bank of India.“It has been alleged that CRF Logistics PVT. Ltd., which is located in Anand, represented by its two directors Deepak Shah and Jagadish Shah, entered into a conspiracy with Rajesh Sharma, proprietor of Rishita Auto-craft, Sabarkantha, Gujarat, to cheat the bank,” said a CBI official.The accused obtained credit facilities from the bank to the tune of about Rs.55.81 crore, including Rs.48.31 crore of term loan, for purchase of 125 trucks from a supplier company and to get PUF insulated refrigerated container fixed on the chassis from the Sabarkantha-based firm. The accused firm dealt in perishable goods.However, the company directors allegedly cancelled the orders partially and took delivery of only 25 trucks. Though the differential amount for 100 trucks, about Rs. 14.81 crore was refunded by the supplier to the bank, the amount disbursed to Rishita Auto-craft was allegedly outstanding.“It was alleged that the remaining 25 trucks were not given to the Union Bank of India for inspection. The company later allowed inspection of only five trucks and even they were found to be fitted with ordinary containers instead of PUF insulated refrigerated ones,” the CBI official said.According to the CBI, the accused persons, without ensuring the end use of the loan had allegedly diverted the funds, thereby causing a loss of about Rs.38.53 crore to the bank.
