Local fishermen have decided to boycott Katchatheevu pilgrimage for the annual festival at St Antony’s Church and not lend their boats. The pilgrimage is scheduled for February 20 and 21.Leaders of 11 fishermen associations met here on Saturday and decided to boycott the festival in protest against the arrest of fishermen by the Lankan Navy and confiscation of their boats, P. Sesu Raja, leader of an association, said. The associations felt that there was no point in attending the festival, organised by the Jaffna Diocese when fishermen were not allowed to fish around the islet as per the agreement after India ceded the islet to Sri Lanka, he said.The Sri Lankan authorities repeatedly warned fishermen against crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and threatened to ‘nationalise’ their confiscated boats but the Indian government remained silent, the leaders lamented.They have conveyed their decision to L. Sahayaraj, Verkodu Parish Priest, who is the chief coordinator of the pilgrimage. Mr. Sesu Raja said leaders had also decided to launch an indefinite strike from Sunday to press for their demand for release of boats.They are protesting against the frequent arrestsby Sri LankanNavy
