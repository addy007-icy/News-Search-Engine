The Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH) and International Psycho-Oncology Society (IPOS) are partnering to present a two-day workshop on ‘Psychological distress in cancer: Identifying it and providing support’, at the IITH campus on January 30 and 31.Elaborating the need for this workshop in India, Mahati Chittem, Assistant Professor, Department of Liberal Arts, IITH, said, “Nearly every patient and family member in India experiences distress at some point during their cancer journey which goes completely undetected. Chronic distress leads to major problems such as dropping out of the medical treatment, tensions in the family, impacting work, and causing feelings of loneliness and despair. Our research at IITH shows that healthcare professionals need to be equipped with skills for timely identification of distress and for providing basic, appropriate support to ailing patients and families.”He said this will be India’s first workshop focused specifically on psychological distress in cancer care and hope to raise awareness and help with skills-building for anyone interested in healthcare.Owing to high levels of cancer-related distress among patients, the International Psycho-Oncology Society (IPOS) endorsed distress as the 6th vital sign in June 2009 with a mission to implement screening for distress as a global standard.This workshop of experiential skills development will involve seven sessions to enhance the use of essential techniques to identify patients who experience psychological distress and to provide them appropriate psychological support. Targeted for all who are involved in multidisciplinary aspects of cancer care, the workshop will be highly interactive and engaging.
