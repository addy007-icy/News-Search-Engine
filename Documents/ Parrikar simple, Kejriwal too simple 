Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, who tried to keep politics out of his speech at the International Conference on Enabling Make in India here on Wednesday, somehow could not avoid making a taunt against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Taking a line from Gopalkrishna Joshi who introduced him as simple, Mr. Parrikar referred to Mr. Kejriwal as being too simple and said that one should not differentiate between people of the same type.His reference to Mr. Kejriwal came while mentioning about maintaining integrity in public life and how those in power were audited and investigated by various agencies. “If the Delhi Chief Minister has his way, he will have a Delhi Lokayukta. And, he is too simple,” he taunted.
