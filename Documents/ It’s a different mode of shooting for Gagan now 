Gagan ke us paar! Well, ace shooter and 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist Gagan Narang had different targets to shoot in the early hours of Saturday morning!This famous Hyderabadi, who had already booked a slot for the 2016 Rio Olympics, was on his maiden trip of bird watching armed – not with a gun – with the latest camera equipment to capture some of the wonderful creations of the nature.Interestingly, the 32-year-old Gagan, who returned to the city only a couple of days ago from what he calls an “immensely satisfying trip” to Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan, took time off from his busy training schedule to have a look at the different species of birds which have made Ameenpur Lake near BHEL their ‘home’.And, like in the shooting ranges, Gagan was spot on straight away – capturing the image of a cormorant catching the fish.“Oh! I got it. Considering this is my first trip of bird watching, though I did shoot some birds in Ranthambore, it has been a wonderful experience to be here at the lake,” he exclaimed later with a sense of pride.And, as the shooter was making gentle steps not to disturb the birds which were busy in their own world, Gagan’s delight in spotting the kingfisher perched on a thin branch of a bush was understandable given his love for the nature.For someone who has been taking pictures across the world whenever he had time and not competing in shooting competitions for close to a decade now, Gagan loves photography and his knowledge of the camera and the minute details is pretty startling.“I love these birds in flight for they are such a visual delight,” says Gagan even while having a look after freezing in his camera the kingfisher trying to take-off. The painted storks and the stilts at the lake also saw his face lit up as he positioned to ‘capture’ them in his camera.“There are few better places in this world than a locale which keeps you closer to the nature and far away from the madding crowd. I tell you once you see the Bengal Tiger in the reserve; it keeps coming back to you. It has magic in its eyes,” says Gagan apparently pleased with what has been a highly successful trip.And, the champion sportsperson signs off with a promise that he would keep visiting these kind of places to continue his romance with the flora and fauna.
