The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has strongly opposed the State government’s move to withdraw cases against Sri Ram Sene president Pramod Mutalik, describing it as “demoralising” and “hurting” Muslims and other minority communities in the State.In a memorandum submitted to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Home Minister G. Parameshwara through the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Monday, IUML district president Kutubuddin F. Gorikhan and secretary Mohammed Aslam M. Pachapuri said that the move reflected lack of clarity in tackling communalism on the part of the Congress government which boasted of upholding secularism.The move also shows that the Congress government believed in “soft communalism” and the Sri Ram Sene was its “B team”.They said that since Independence the Congress had been practicing soft communalism towards Muslims, resulting in loss of life and property of the members of the community and it has been treating Muslims as vote-bank for over six decades now.It was highly shocking that the government was planning to withdraw 13 cases filed against Mr. Mutalik, who has been “terrorising” Muslims with his highly provocative speeches against them as also against Christians, they said.He was trying to spread hatred in the minds of peace-loving Hindus towards minorities. Withdrawal of cases against him would mean encouraging fundamentalists and those terrorising people on religious grounds, they said.
