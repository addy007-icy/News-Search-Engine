Gone are the days when the typical gambler was an unemployed man or a low-paid person operating in crowded places such as festival venues. The silent addiction of gambling is slowly making a comeback in several parts of the district, this time through exclusive social groupings. The operation of gambling rackets in the region came to light recently with a police raid at a private club near the Nedumbassery airport.“Majority of the people addicted to gambling belongs to the upper middle class.The games are generally organised on the pretext of parties and they play with such high stakes that the total amount transacted over these card games will run into several lakhs,” official sources said.According to him, the activity is on the rise, especially on the city suburbs, such as Muvattupuzha or Aluva where these rackets operate from some lodges and apartments.‘Pannimalathu’, an indigenous version of poker, is the most commonly plated game in these gambling dens.“There are people who have racked up extensive debts, which at its worst, force the victims to contemplate even robbery. Further, the stress of worrying about unpaid debts also leads to years of insomnia,” they added.Take it easy, people!Notwithstanding a recent crackdown on chain snatchers in and around the city, even the police appear to have begun to accept the fact that these thefts are parts and parcel of everyday life.At least that was what a middle-aged couple from Tripunithura must have felt, who registered a complaint with the police over a chain-snatching incident. The incident took place about four days ago when they called up the police control room and complained that an unidentified person snatched the woman’s gold chain during a bus journey.‘Concerned’ copsAs soon as the theft happened, the woman first called up her husband and then contacted the police. While the husband responded swiftly by rushing to a spot and tracing the bus a few kilometres away, the cops could not turn up for reasons best known to them.Though unable to turn up, the cops, however, were so concerned about the victim that they returned a call a couple of hours later, enquiring whether they could unearth the gold chain or not!Reporting by Hiran Unnikrishnan
