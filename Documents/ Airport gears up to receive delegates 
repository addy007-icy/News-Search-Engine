The Visakhapatnam International Airport is fully geared to receive delegates coming from different countries to attend the Partnership Summit-2016 being organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in association with the State government from January 10 to 12.Delegates from 41 countries are expected to participate in the summit. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials have been striving for the past few days to enhance the beauty of the airport. Airport is the face of the city and the first impression that the delegates get is vital to showcase not only the biggest city in the new State but also Andhra Pradesh as a whole.“We have improved the lighting at the new terminal building and the front elevation has been redone, the building has been given a facelift both from inside and outside with new paintings and the internal roads have been re-carpeted,” Airport Director Vinod Sharma told The Hindu when contacted on Saturday evening.“Additional lights have been provided at the parking areas. We expect 10 to 15 special chartered flights to bring in the delegates from different places and have made arrangements for the same without affecting the regular schedules,” he said.“In view of the recent terrorist attack on the Pathankot Air Force base, security has been stepped up and we are already on high alert. We have redeployed our manpower in such a way that additional personnel would be available in each shift during the three-day summit. Apart from stationing of security personnel at different points, CCTVs have also been installed to ensure the safety of visiting dignitaries,” CISF Assistant Commandant A.K. Mitra said.
