The Vijyan Jyot, symbolising flame of knowledge, reached Mysuru on Saturday evening in the run-up to the 103rd Indian Science Congress to be held in the city from January 3 to 7.It was inspired by the late President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s vision 2020 in taking science to every quarter of society and is an initiative of MM Activ, which is associated with the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), in organising the science exhibition.The flame was received by K.S. Rangappa, Vice-Chancellor, University of Mysore, and was flagged off from Bengaluru by V. Manjula, Principal Secretary, IT, BT and S&T Department, Government of Karnataka, earlier on Monday.“Vigyan Jyot perfectly sets the tone for ISC as well as the ‘Pride of India’ expo as it creates curiosity in the minds of common persons. This curiosity will bring people to ISC and PoI. The torch is a promise to take the light of science education and knowledge to every corner of the country,” Prof. Rangappa said.The organisers said Vijyan Jyot is a movement dedicated to fostering scientific temper in society with focus on youth and the aim behind the journey is to encourage youngsters to pursue a career in science. The Vigyan Jyot run saw participation from 50 athletes and over 500 students, who carried the torch across the streets of Mysuru.Earlier, the torch reached St. Philomena’s College and principal Krishne Gowda handed it over to athletes and students, who carried it to the venue of the science congress. The torch will remain lit at the PoI expo.
