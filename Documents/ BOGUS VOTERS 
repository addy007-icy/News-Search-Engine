The United Democratic Front (UDF) has initiated steps to identify the bogus names which have found a place in the draft voters’ list published by the Election Commission on November 2. A control room has been opened at the KPCC office for coordinating the verification under the leadership of general secretary Sajiv Joseph. Initially, it has been decided to verify the lists at the block level. UDF leaders would conduct house visits for verification and submit a report to the KPCC by January 10.— Special Correspondent
