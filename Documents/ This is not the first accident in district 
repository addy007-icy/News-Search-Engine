The death of seven youths after a SUV plunged into Janivara tank near Channarayapatna has, once again, brought the alleged neglect in ensuring the safety of riders on tank bunds in the district.Residents of villages in Hassan had protested against the alleged apathy of the government when eight people died after a KSRTC bus plunged into the Vishnusamudra tank near Belur in July, 2013.The district earlier witnessed an incident on May 29, 2008, when 25 people of a marriage party riding on a lorry died after the vehicle fell into a coconut farm near Agrahara near Arkalgudu.Following the incident in Belur, the Public Works Department took up the work to install crash barrier around the tank. The department also installed protective walls at Dorasamudra near Halebid to avoid such instances at a cost of Rs. 60 lakh.The Executive Engineer of Public Works Department had submitted a proposal of Rs. 36.5 crore to construct retaining walls in all vulnerable places in the district.These vulnerable places included Janivara tank as well. Others are in Alur taluk, Hassan taluk and Channarayapatna taluk.Public Works Executive Engineer (Hassan) Krishnamurthy, on Sunday, told The Hindu , “We have safety measures in place in all black-spots in the district. We had submitted the proposal and taken up work as and when funds released.”The Public Works Department felt that there was no need for a crash barrier or a retaining wall for the spot close to Janivara tank near Channarayapatna, where the accident occurred on Saturday morning.“We have recently had installed a crash barrier at the tank bund, where the road is narrow. The accident has happened at another end where the road is quite wide and enough space to take a turn. We had felt there was no need of a barrier there,” said Krishnamurthy, Executive Engineer of PWD.However, the officers inspected the spot on Saturday after the incident and decided to propose a barrier. “Our officers have inspected the spot and decided to have a barrier in the spot from where the vehicle plunged into the tank,” he added.Crash barrier to come up at Janivara tank25 people died at Agrahara near Arakalgud in 2008Eight people died at Belur in July 2013PWD constructed retaining walls for some tanksProposal of Rs 36.5 crore sent for retaining walls
