Longevity in sports, from a fan’s perspective, endears and enriches. How else could the relevance of a sporting carnival be explained? As subjective an experience that enrichment is, endearment is based on what a spectator seeks and what a sport actively contrives to generate — pleasure.It is with this familiar sense of nostalgia and celebration that the city warms up to its flagship tennis event — the ATP Aircel Chennai Open. The 20th edition of the event will see Leander Paes, Rajeev Ram, Benoit Paire and Borna Coric leading from the front.On courtThe 20 years bring with it a treasure trove of delightful memories. The frenzied anticipation trickling down to murmurs of disappointment after the legendary Boris Becker’s unexpected early exit in 1998; The dynamic duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi doing what they do best to claim their fourth doubles title in Chennai in 2002; Carlos Moya, on the grind, putting it across Paradorn Srichaphan in a two hour and 35 minute final in 2005; Belgian Xavier Malisse becoming the first to win both the singles and doubles titles in 2007; The sinewy Rafael Nadal prevailing over a gritty Moya in an exhaustive four-hour semifinal in 2008; India’s very own Somdev Devvarman’s stellar run to the final in 2009; Chennai bidding adieu to its most beloved Carlos Moya in 2010; Memories, memories! Pleasantly warm and charming memories! As the city’s bonding with tennis has grown, cultivated and sustained by these memories, so has the flair of the Indian talent pool. Well-served are the likes of Ramkumar Ramanathan, Rohan Bopanna and Somdev Devvarman. In fact, Ramkumar’s claim to fame was his first round win against Somdev Devvarman in 2014.Unfortunately, this year’s Indian direct entrant in the main draw, World No. 93 Yuki Bhambri had to pull out of the competition, unable to recover from an injury in time. Thankfully though, Ramkumar’s wild card entry has renewed Indian hopes. In the doubles category, Leander Paes will team up with Marcel Granollers of Spain.Leading the star attraction is the defending champion, two-time Grand Slam winner and World No. 4 Stanislas Wawrinka and the big-hitting South African, World No. 12 Kevin Anderson. Also in the impressive line-up are Benoit Paire, Roberto Batista Agut and Vasek Pospisil, to name a few. The timing of the event is remarkable for there is a sense of appreciation prevalent in the city in acknowledgement of its own colossal efforts to resurface from the deluge of torrential rains. To be able to host an event of this magnitude, while straight out of a crisis, is more reason to celebrate.Stanislas WawrinkaIn 2013, he created history by playing the longest doubles match at the Davis Cup tie against the Czech Republic, partnering with Marco Chiudinelli.Wawrinka is a Swiss professional tennis player and has won two Grand Slam singles titles in his career — the 2014 Australian Open and the 2015 French Open.
