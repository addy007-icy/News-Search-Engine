The district administration has dropped its proposal to construct an underpass at Balaramapuram as part of the widening of the Karamana-Kaliyikkavila stretch of the NH 66.The deliberations pertaining to the proposed underpass at Balaramapuram have all come to a naught with the trading community of Balaramapuram deciding against budging from their stance in the issue.The proposal, which was not part of the detailed project report, was initially mooted by the district authorities to bring down the congestion of traffic in the busy in the Balaramapuram junction.It was also planned after taking into consideration the other development projects such as the Vizhinjam seaport project that are set to be launched in the region.The realisation of the proposal would have required the acquisition of nearly 3 metres, in addition to the 30.2 metres Right of Way that was already acquired for the road widening.Additional landHowever, the necessity of acquiring additional land presented the revenue officials with a difficult task.This was largely due to the fact that many commercial establishments have come up on either side of the 30.2 metres-wide Right of Way after the alignment was undertaken for the project in 2010.“We have made several attempts at convincing the traders to cede their land for the infrastructure development. We sought to impress upon them that the prime beneficiaries would be the local residents and the trading community of Balaramapuram. However, with there being no much progress in the discussions, we have been forced to abandon the project,” an official said.Meanwhile, revenue officials are currently undertaking the process of categorising the land that has been identified to be acquired on the Balaramapuram-Vazhimukku stretch.The land will be classified into four categories – A, B, C and D – on the basis of various parameters.CompensationIn order to compensate the individuals who have ceded their land coming within the Pravachambalam-Balaramapuram stretch, the district administration has requested the government to release an amount of Rs.100 crore.Administrative sanction has been provided for only Rs.6 crore as of yet.
