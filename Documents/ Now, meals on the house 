Ask anyone if you like to visit a government office and the reply is a sure ‘no.’Now if you ask the same to anyone from Kunnukara, a village near North Paravur, and might get surprised. For, what you have asked is something they look forward to with so much joy and eagerness.In a novel initiative, the local body has rolled out a programme offering free noon meals to people coming to the government offices and hospitals in its jurisdiction for various purposes. The scheme, a first of its kind in the State, is aimed at making the visits to the government offices here a more exciting experience.According to Francis Tharayil, president, Kunnukara panchayat the scheme covers four hospitals including the veterinary hospital and other government offices including the Panchayat office, Kerala State Electricity Board, Agricultural office, among others. The programme, envisaged as a way of giving back to the community, is run on the first five working days of every week and helps change people’s inhibition about going to a government office for some service.“To start with, we are offering them a simple but nutritious meal of rice gruel with curry which will be later expanded to a sumptuous feast in the next stage. It is expected to benefit around 175 people on any given working day, ” said Mr. Tharayil.The panchayat expects the number of people availing the service to reach 400- equal to the average number of outpatient tickets sold at the four hospitals in a day.The cost of implementing the scheme is estimated to be just around Rs.10, which is met from a contribution from the State government under the Akshya noon-meal scheme.“We are also taking to organic farming of rice and vegetables on a massive scale so that that the scope of the programme is extended to more people and also to make sure that nobody is turned away from it in the long run,” the president added.Kunnukara panchayat will offer free meals to people who visit hospitals, government offices
