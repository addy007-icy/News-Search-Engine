I sell Iron utensils but I am not iron-hearted to my customers. Generally, people buy things only after hard haggling. Though I tend to be stiff, I gradually relent and sell my goods at a lower price depending upon the customer. At times my profit margin takes a heavy beating. But I do that to retain the customer. If the customer feels satisfied, he will return to my shop.I hail from R. Kavanur village in Ramanathapuram. My father is a farmer. Being the eldest in the family, I have lot of responsibilities. I was not good in academics and dropped out after class X and went to Chennai looking for a job. I worked in a popular utensils shop in Pondy Bazaar for more than 15 years. Sometime ago I had the urge to return and it has been six months since I joined the shop in Pudhumandapam.Though I started as a worker in this shop owned by my father’s friend, I am a partner now having made a small investment. The shop was closed for more than four years before I joined. After I came here, I started attracting customers’ attention by offering them a good price in order to withstand competition. Now that I have gained some footing I have plans to expand the business. In a week’s time I am planning to stock brass, aluminium and stainless steel utensils.Mine was a late marriage as I had to get my sister married. My wife is a trained nurse and is looking for a job. I am blessed with a son who is two-and-half-year old. I earn around Rs.200 a day and live a hand-to-mouth existence. But I am hoping my business will pick up and take me to great heights.(A fortnightly column on men and women who make Madurai what it is)
