Granules USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Granules India Ltd, has entered into an agreement with Par Pharmaceutical Inc., a subsidiary of Endo International plc, to market generic version of over-the-counter omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate in North America. The company would start marketing on getting the approval of US Food and Drug Administration, which is expected in July this year. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor reducing production of stomach acid. Chairman and managing director of Granules India Krishna Prasad Chigurupati said the exclusive agreement with Par Pharmaceutical would strengthen the companyâ€™s OTC product basket and widen its offerings in the North American store brand market.
