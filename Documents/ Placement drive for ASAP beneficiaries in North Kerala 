: It is for the third successive year that the placement drive for student beneficiaries of the Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP) is being organised here on January 16, in which 150 students from Kannur, Kasaragod, Malappuram and Kozhikode who have been given skill training under the programme are participating.The placement drive, being organised under the aegis of the Kannur team of ASAP, is a sequel to the initiative begun in 2014 for the student beneficiaries of the programme. Many of those who participated in the recruitment drive had been placed then. In 2015, the drive was held in association with the District Employment Exchange. District ASAP authorities said that 30 beneficiary students were selected on the spot by companies such as Bosch and Siemens, TCS and Videocon.“We are now conducting grooming sessions for the participating students to equip them to face the interview,” said Smitha Sukumaran, ASAP programme manager here. She said that the three phase grooming includes one-to-one meeting with the students, their portfolio creation, and efforts to make them aware of the do’s and don’t’s while attending an interview. Sessions on standards to be followed for career sustainability and growth and mock interviews are also being held, she added.ASAP is an initiative of the State government for increasing the employability of students in the higher secondary and undergraduate courses. Students selected for the programme are being offered skill courses in various skill sectors. The recruitment drive is being organised with the support of the ASAP placement cell.
