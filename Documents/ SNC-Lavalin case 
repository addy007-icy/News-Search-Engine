The High Court of Kerala expressed doubts over the sustainability of Thiruvananthapuram CBI Courtâ€™s order discharging the seven accused, including CPI(M) leader Pinarayi Vijayan, from the SNC-Lavalin case. Though the High Court had issued the order on January 15, the signed copy of the order was issued to the State and other parties in the case only on Tuesday. The order was issued by Justice P. Ubaid while accepting the State's argument for expediting the hearing of the petitions challenging the acquittal of Mr. Vijayan in the case.
