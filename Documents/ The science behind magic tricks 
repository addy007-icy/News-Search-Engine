A girl, with her eyes covered, tells the value and the serial number of a currency note by simply grasping its smell and gently touching it.Another girl, also with her eyes covered, identifies the colour of a cloth and the expression of a person’s photo printed on a cover of a book by simply smelling it.A boy sneaks through scattered group of his colleagues without even touching anybody and tells the name of his colleagues by simply smelling. These were some of the demonstrations by trained girls and boys at Government Girls PU College here on Saturday. In the end, they explained the science behind the magic. Their message was not to fall prey to black magicians who use similar magic to exploit innocent people for their own ends.This event was organised by the Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samiti (BGVS) as part of its Statewide campaign against superstitions.“Superstitions and blind faiths are the biggest threat to the development of any society. Black magicians widely use these tricks to mislead and exploit innocent people economically and sexually.The aim of our campaign is to inculcate scientific temper and rational thinking among people, particularly young minds, so that they would not fall prey to any black magicians,” Syed Hafeez Ulha, BGVS leader. He also demanded that the State government pass the anti-superstition bill in its original form to check the spread of ignorance and superstitions.“The government should take widespread campaign for popularising the science and rational thinking among people. At the same time, it should enact a law that could stringently deal with superstitious practices without harming religious sentiments of people,” he said.
