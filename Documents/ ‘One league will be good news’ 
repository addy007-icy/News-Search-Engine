Chennaiyin FC which bought goalkeeper Karanjit Singh for Rs. 60 lakh for the recently-concluded Hero Indian Super League (ISL) feels that ‘one league’ will be good news for Indian football, but it’s for the AIFF to take a call on the matter which has been debated for many months now.Karanjit added: “ Hamare kehene se kuch nahi hotha. After the ISL, you don’t get much time to train and practice with the clubs. But if it becomes one league, it will be good. But at the same time, I must also say that I have been playing the I-League for Salgaocar for five years. It’s almost the same team like last year; so it’s not much of an issue at all in the context of understanding each other.”
