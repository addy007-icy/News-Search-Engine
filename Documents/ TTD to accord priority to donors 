After fixing the loopholes in the irregularities in darshan, accommodation of pilgrims and the distribution of laddu prasadam, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has now turned its focus on according priority to the devotees who have munificently donated to the schemes being implemented by it.The donors are being reportedly given the cold shoulder, if one is to go by the fact that more than one-third of the fraternity (donors) do not have the mandatory passbooks to which they are legally entitled.For the records, the TTD issues passbooks to every donor enlisting the details of the privileges to which he is entitled. The privileges include ticket-free darshan, free accommodation, free laddus and the likes. Subject to the volume of the contribution, the donors are also provided with special darshan and arjitha seva tickets on request, besides being bestowed with the privilege of attending the worship along with their family members.At present, the TTD has a donor base of 35,000 to 36,000 who have donated more than Rs. 1 lakh to its schemes including Annadanam, Pranadanam, Arogya varaprasadini, Sarvas Shreya trust to help destitute children, heritage preservation trust to deal with the protection of dilapidated temples, Go-samrakshana and a few trusts.Contributions received through donations pile up to around Rs. 50 lakh per day. In an exclusive interview with The Hindu, TTD Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao said it was high time the management should go in for a self-introspection with regard to the facilities being extended to donors. It is really painful that several of the donors if not all are not being meted out with the treatment they deserve.More than one-third of the donors do not have passbooks to which they are legally entitled, says TTD EO
