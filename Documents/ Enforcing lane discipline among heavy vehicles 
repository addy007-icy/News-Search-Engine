Unable to end the tyranny of multi-axle trucks on the National Highway, the Angamaly police have been on an overdrive to keep the heavy vehicles on the left side of the road.As part of it, the police have now begun to place multi-language stickers inside the driver cabin of these trucks, directing the truckers to maintain the slow-moving left lane. Besides stickers, they are also given a brief orientation against hogging the road and tailgating.“All the trucks entering the district from Thrissur-side are stopped at Karukutty, where they briefly interact with the policemen.The drive comes as these trucks began to block even the ambulance and police vehicles,” explained an official.The situation is particularly worrisome during night hours when heavily-laden vehicles occupy both the lanes and light vehicles cut lanes dangerously to move ahead.If there was one group that heaved a sigh of relief following the transfer of Harisankar Deputy Commissioner of police, it probably was a section of policemen. .According to sources, the transfer news was greeted with relief as many of them were disgruntled at the reform measures introduced by Mr.Harisankar.The measures, obviously aimed to improve the efficiency of policemen, effectively stretched their daily working hours by a couple of hours.In their opinion, the extended hours coupled with limited staff, affected the overall quality of policing.Though nobody came out in the open, the protestors sent several anonymous letters to the media houses.Mr. Harisankar, however, sought to play down the criticism and viewed the protests as a repartee to his attempt to analyse the performance of policemen on patrol dutyNow that a new officer is set to take charge, officials are craving for an amiable boss, who is well connected to everyday policing.Reporting by Hiran Unnikrishnan
