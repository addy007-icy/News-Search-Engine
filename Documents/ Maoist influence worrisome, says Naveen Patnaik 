Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday expressed concern over inroads made by the Left wing extremists in four central Odisha districts and asked senior police officers to pay special attention to curb their influence.Addressing the valedictory function of senior police officers’ conference here, Mr. Patnaik said: “The Left wing extremism continues to be a major concern for the State. Though we have been able to contain the menace to the areas bordering our neighbouring States, the recent movement and activities of the Maoist cadre in the districts of Bolangir, Kalahandi, Kandhamal and Boudh is worrisome.”“We should handle this new development effectively. We have already created adequate resources in terms of manpower, equipment and other logistics supplemented by the deployment of central armed police forces. There is no reason why the police leadership cannot counter the inroads made by the Maoist into the central Odisha,” Chief Minister pointed out.“District superintendent of police and the senior officials in the headquarters should fight the menace with renewed enthusiasm and commitment backed by meticulous planning,” he exhorted, adding officials should take special interest to ensure timely payment of personal claims of police personnel who die in duty.Mr. Patnaik, who also holds Home portfolio, asked senior police officers to make district visit during the first week of every month regularly like senior IAS officers “Besides, inspecting police stations they must visit some of the complainants and assess the performance of police. I will review the outcome of your visit.”Laying emphasis on improvement in police investigation with regular training and capacity building, Chief Minister said, “the recently created District Level Standing Committees have started reviewing the acquittal orders, but they have to fix responsibility for shoddy performance. Disciplinary proceedings should be initiated against poor investigation and prosecution.”“The Home Department is taking steps to improve the prosecution system by recruitment of government prosecutors and to enhance the disciplinary control of the director of public prosecutions,” he said.
