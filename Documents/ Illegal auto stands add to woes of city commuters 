Illegal autorickshaw stands continue to thrive in the city, thanks to the lack of enforcement and political patronage enjoyed by the organisations of drivers.Estimates by the Motor Vehicles Department revealed that the number of unauthorised stands will be several times higher than the nearly 13 stands sanctioned by the Kochi Corporation.“Illegal stands are a common sight near malls, hospitals, busy junctions and in front of key commercial establishments in the city. They [drivers] have the backing of various political parties. No action is possible as any move to clamp down on such unauthorised stands will invoke political protests and put pressure on us to keep quiet,” said a senior inspector of the Motor Vehicles Department, Ernakulam.The illegal stands have turned commuting through the already narrow and congested roads in the city a harrowing experience.Autorickshaws here occupy a major portion of these main stretches slowing down the movement of other vehicles. The enforcement agencies seem shifting its responsibilities by not acting against the violators.“It’s a reality that there are many illegal autorickshaw stands in the city. Nobody is permitted to block public transport as per the guidelines,” said Baby Vinod, Assistant Commissioner of Kochi Traffic (West). He refused to comment on whether political backing enjoyed by the autorickshaw drivers was stopping them from acting against the illegal stands.Autorickshaw drivers said that the number of authorised stands in the city was abysmally low compared to the vehicles plying on the roads.“We have been requesting the authorities to sanction more stands in city areas instead of asking us to utilise the authorised stands that are mostly out of the city limits. The autorickshaw drivers have no other option but to identify spaces in city areas with the support of the political parties,” said V.S. Sunil, Ernakulam mandalam secretary of Autorickshaw Drivers Federation (AITUC).
