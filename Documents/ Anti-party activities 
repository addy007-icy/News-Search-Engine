The TRS suspended four of its councillors in Nirmal Municipality from the party for 6 years for anti-party activists. Party Adilabad district president Loka Bhuma Reddy said the councillors, and husbands of two of them, were supporting the Congress on the floor and outside the municipality which warranted the action. An inquiry was held following which the suspension order was issued. Those who were suspended were Thota Latha, 5th ward councillor, Sadam Swapna, 14th ward councillor, Nella Arun, 15th ward councillor, and Gopu Gopi, 20th ward councillor, besides the husbands of the first two incumbents.
