: The Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) has postponed the ‘no vehicle’ stir that it had planned for half an hour on January 14.Front convener Vaikom Viswan said in a press note here on Tuesday that the stir, to protest against the hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel, was being postponed in view of the difficulties it was likely to cause to Sabarimala pilgrims. Fresh date of the stir, which seeks to bring vehicular traffic to a halt for a brief period, would be announced later, he said.— Special Correspondent
