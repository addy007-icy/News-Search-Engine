In a pre-budget meeting with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Indian IT majors warned the government that the proposed new norms for determining a company’s effective place of management could result in double taxation on their global subsidiaries.The information technology industry also raised concerns about the phasing out of SEZ incentives and tax issues. Mr. Jaitley stressed upon the importance of the electronics, IT and BPO industry to the government’s initiatives.“The Government recognises this sector’s potential and the Information Technology sector is a key pillar in various flagship initiatives like Digital India, Make in India, Skill India as well as Start-up India among others,” Mr. Jaitley said during his opening remarks at the meeting.“We expressed our concerns regarding the Place of Effective Management rules that will come into place from April 1, 2016. Our request is to defer the law until the necessary changes have been made. We (IT companies) have subsidiaries outside, and they should not be taxed in India as they are already being taxed abroad,” Anil Chanana, Chief Financial Officer, HCL Technologies said.The draft guidelines on the Place of Effective Management (POEM), open for comment until January 9, defines the POEM as “a place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made”.Ambiguity in the guidelines regarding how long a company has to have India as a place of effective management for it to be subject to Indian tax law is one of the issues troubling Indian corporates. Similarly, the “key management and commercial decisions” term in the definition is considered too vague. Another major point of concern raised by the IT companies was the government’s plan to remove the tax incentives granted to Special Economic Zones. Most representatives asked for this to be deferred by 3-4 years.“In the face of a barrage of protectionist measures being adopted in other countries, notably by our clients, we need to be careful about remaining competitive. With the exports benefits under the foreign trade policy not applicable to IT, we expressed out concern regarding the phasing out of the SEZ benefits,” Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar said.The tax exemptions currently given to SEZs are set to be removed as part of the NDA government’s proposal to phase out corporate tax exemptions and bring down the corporate tax rate.While companies like Foxconn expressed their commitment to the Indian market, they also voiced their concerns regarding certain tax issues.“Our commitment to India remains, and we continue to support Digital India and Make in India. We will have more investments, and are looking to move beyond mobile and TV. But we have asked for an extension of the exemptions from the 12 per cent countervailing duty,” Josh Foulger, Vice President, Foxconn said.At the moment, parts used in the manufacture of mobile handsets and tablets in India are exempt from the countervailing duty. However, the Economic Survey 2015 had suggested that these exemptions be removed so as to boost domestic manufacturing.The Economic Survey is critical of the government's strategy to exempt certain imported goods from countervailing duty (CVD) and has suggested that such a strategy should be done away with to make imports expensive and help the 'Make in India' programme.“There is one response that would help manufacturing and the 'Make in India' initiative without being as difficult as improving the business environment, and as controversial and expensive as the industrial policy or protectionist response: eliminating the exemptions in the countervailing duties (CVD) and special additional duties (SAD) levied on imports,” the Economic Survey said
