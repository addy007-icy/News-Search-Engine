: Concentration levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 10 to 13 per cent during the 15-day odd-even plan by the Delhi government, a new study has found.Researchers from the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago and Evidence for Policy Design at Harvard University studied the levels of PM2.5 in Delhi and surrounding areas before and after the odd-even trial. The researchers used hourly data from November 2015 to January 2016 from seven monitors of the Central Pollution Control Board in Delhi and 16 monitors of the data journalism initiative IndiaSpend in Faridabad, Noida and Gurgaon.As per the study, the odd-even programme decreased PM2.5 levels in Delhi by 35 to 47 micrograms per cubic metre, which is 10 to 13 per cent on average. An additional 10 per cent decrease was seen between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. â€“ the duration of the odd-even scheme. The level was well above 200 micrograms per cubic metre, while the standard for PM2.5 is 60.The study says that though levels of PM2.5 increased across the NCR, the hike in levels in Delhi was comparatively less than that in Faridabad. This, the researchers said, points to the effectiveness of the odd-even policy. The study is based on the assumption that there are parallel trends, which means that if the odd-even policy had not been imposed the change in PM levels in Delhi would have been similar to that outside the Capital.The programme ended up reducing pollution by taking cars off the road which lead to decongestion. This in turn translated to fewer cars idling on the roads, said the study.
