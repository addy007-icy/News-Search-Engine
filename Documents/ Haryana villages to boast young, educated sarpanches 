Haryana villages will now boast a large number of young and educated sarpanches as people have largely voted for such candidates in the first two phases of the three-phase elections to Panchayati Raj Institutions.According to the e-dashboard of the State Election Commission, the average age of the elected sarpanch in the first two phases is just 34 years. The average age in the case of Mewat is 28 years, the lowest average age of an elected sarpanch for any district in the State.The low average age in the elections is being attributed to several new conditions, including minimum educational qualification, fixed by the Haryana government for the candidates this time.The government has fixed matriculation as essential qualification for male (general) candidates contesting the panchayat elections, while the qualification for females (general) and Scheduled Caste male candidate is education up to Class VIII. In the case of a female candidate belonging to the SC category contesting election for the post of panch, the minimum qualification is education up to Class V. Of the total 2,576 sarpanches elected in phase one of the elections, 1,515 are males and 1,061 females. The total sarpanches in phase two are 1,964. Of these, 1,154 are males and 810 females.In the first phase, 264 elected sarpanch are graduates or above: 19 from Ambala, 18 from Bhiwani, 17 from Faridabad, 10 from Fatehabad, seven from Gurgaon, 12 from Hisar, 10 from Jhajjar, 11 from Jind, 14 from Kaithal, 11 from Karnal, 16 from Kurukshetra, 14 from Mahendergarh, seven from Mewat, 18 from Palwal, four from Panchkula, eight from Panipat, 23 from Rewari, 10 from Rohtak, 13 from Sirsa, six from Sonipat and 16 from Yamunanagar. Also, 344 elected sarpanches have studied up to the senior secondary level, while 1,552 and 416 sarpanches are matriculate or Class VIII pass respectively.In the second phase of the elections, 219 elected sarpanches are graduate or above, 243 are Class XII pass, and while 1,165 and 337 sarpanches are Class X and Class VIII pass respectively. Besides, as many as 1,061 female sarpanches have been elected in the first phase of these elections and 810 in the second phase.“Seventy-seven female sarpanches have been elected in different villages of Mewat in the first two phases of these elections. It can largely be attributed to the new educational qualifications imposed by the Haryana government. Due to this, many older people were rendered ineligible and were forced to field young men and women from their families,” said social activist Mohammad Yunis Alvi.In the third phase of the general elections to Panchayati Raj Institutions held for 36 Blocks of Haryana on January 24, 11,584 candidates were in the fray for 5,362 posts of panch; 6,370 candidates for 1,550 the posts of sarpanch and 2,877 for 750 posts of member of the panchayat samiti.According to the e-dashboard of the SEC, the average age of the elected sarpanch is just 34 years
