Nothing like a dash of masala or spice to lend that extra flavour to your favourite dish. But if the latest report of the Pesticide Residue Analysis Laboratory under Kerala Agricultural Laboratory is anything to go by, spicing up a curry may not be a good idea for the health conscious.While two of the five samples of cardamom collected from the open market between July and September had pesticide residue above the maximum residue level (MRL) prescribed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), oregano, dry chilli, chilly powder, crushed chilly, cumin powder, cumin, cumin powder, curry masala, fennel, fennel powder, Kashmiri chilly powder, rasam powder and tea were found to contain pesticide below MRL or pesticides without prescribed limits.Of the 31 spices, condiments and processed foods tested, 18 were found to be of safe-to-eat quality.Traces of ethionWhile the two samples of cardamom had residue of quinalphos, an organothiophosphate chemical, tea was found to contain traces of ethion. The other contaminated condiments had residues of pesticides including profenofos, chlorpyrifos, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, bifenthrin and cyfluthrin.VegetablesOf the 48 types of vegetables tested, only curry leaf had pesticide residue above the prescribed limit while samples of green chilly and mint leaf had traces below MRL or pesticides without prescribed MRL.The samples were collected from outlets in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam and Kasaragod districts.Samples of all the 16 types of fruits collected from across the state tested negative for pesticide residue.Of the four dry fruits tested, only two samples of raisins contained pesticides below MRL.None of the six processed foods tested positive for pesticide residue.Experts however point out that the report masks the real picture of pesticide safety because of the failure to prescribe MRL for most pesticides that are abundantly used by farmers, especially on vegetables imported from neighbouring states.Codex standardsIn the absence of MRL approved by FSSAI, scientists under the pesticide residue monitoring project had relied on EU and Codex standards to evaluate samples, a practice that was later dropped on directions from ICAR.Most vegetables safe to eat
