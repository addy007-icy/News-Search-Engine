Twitter proved to be a major boon for scores of commuters in the national Capital on Friday as it provided real-time information on shortest traffic routes and public transport availability, on a day when the Delhi government rolled out its ambitious odd-even scheme.As the number of private cars in the streets of Delhi went down nearly by half, prompting many people to take public transport, this social media provided live information to help people reach their destinations conveniently.Many commuters, not so accustomed to taking public transport and being used to travel in private vehicles, were not at ease with the situation.But, Twitter came in handy for such tech-savvy people, giving them live information, from bus routes to metro links and last-mile connectivity.â€” PTI
