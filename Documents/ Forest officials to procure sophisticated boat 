The authorities of Amrabad Tiger Reserve have decided to procure a new sophisticated boat to patrol from Nagarjunasagar reservoir to Srisailam, an 82-km. stretch of Krishna river.The Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve was divided after the division of Andhra Pradesh. The Telangana part of Tiger Reserve was named as Amrabad Tiger Reserve.Since the boat used earlier went to Andhra Pradesh Forest Department after the bifurcation, the forest authorities had hired a motorised boat used by the local fishermen to patrol along the river.Speaking to The Hindu , Field Director of Tiger Reserve, Vinay Kumar, said that they have decided to procure a sophisticated boat by investing Rs.15 lakh soon.A five-member squad will regularly patrol from Nagarjunasagar to Srisailam, while another five-member staff will patrol from Srisailam to Somasila in another boat. “We already have a boat to discharge the duties from Srisailam to Somasila in Mahabubnagar district,” Mr. Kumar said.Apart from checking poaching, the Field Director said that the patrolling team would also observe the movement of wild animals, which often swim across the river in search of prey and fodder. Mr. Kumar said that the patrolling teams would even help animals cross the river if any of them are found struck in water or mud.Since the division of the State, Mr. Kumar said that they have been using country-made puttis , which are being used by local fishermen, apart from using a hired motorised boat.It will help them patrol from Nagarjunasagar reservoir to Srisailam in Amrabad Tiger Reserve
