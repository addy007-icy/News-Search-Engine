Former One Direction star Zayn Malik has revealed his firs solo single “Pillowtalk” will be released on January 29.Malik, 23, made the announcement by sharing a shirtless snap on Instagram and said the song is about physical intimacy.“I think I’m pretty black and white about what it’s about. Everybody has sex, and it’s something people want to hear about. It’s part of everybody’s life, a very BIG part of life! And you don’t want to sweep it under the carpet. It has to be talked about,” he said.The singer also revealed he would consider doing a One Direction reunion in the future.“I don’t know. If the time was right and that was the thing to do, then I would make that decision when it came around.”One Direction continued as a four-piece and went on to perform their world tour and record a fifth album without him.
