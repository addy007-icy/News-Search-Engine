Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party took out a protest march here on Friday condemning the milk price hike implemented by the State government.During the protest held under the aegis of Hubballi-Dharwad Mahanagar Zilla unit, the party members marched from the party office in Deshpande Nagar to the Court Circle where they staged a demonstration.The protesters then prepared tea on the road and served it to people, without adding milk to it.Addressing protesters, State general secretary of the BJP N. Ravikumar condemned the State governmentâ€™s move in strong terms and said that it was indulging in election politics.He said that now that the panchayat polls were nearing, the State government had claimed that the move was to pay additional price to farmers. But the move was intended at influencing the voters keeping in mind the panchayat polls.The State government should immediately reduce the burden on the public by revoking the hike, he demanded.District BJP president Lingaraj Patil said that although diesel prices were going down since the last two years, the State government, which had hiked bus fares, had not reduced ticket fare till date. And, now, the government had increased milk prices unnecessarily, he said.State BJP vice-president M. Nagara, Deputy Mayor Smita Jadhav, the former MLAs Virabhadrappa Halaharavi and Ashok Katwe and party office-bearers Mahesh Tenginakai, Siddu Mogalishettar, Viresh Sangalad and Nagesh Kalburgi took part in the agitation.
