: After South Delhi, now malls and hospitals in East Delhi will have to make their parking lots free of charge for users as the local municipal corporation passed an order to that effect on Wednesday.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation passed a resolution calling the parking fees being charged by private malls and hospitals as “illegal” under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation had passed a similar resolution in November 2015.Ram Narayan Dubey, the leader of the House in the EDMC, said that parking services were a municipality responsibility under the DMC Act, and the private parking lots were operating without sanction from the corporation.“The parking lots are shown as ‘common areas’ in the building plans of these complexes, so they cannot use the same area to make money by charging for parking,” said Mr. Dubey.EDMC Mayor Harsh Deep Malhotra added that the malls and hospitals were not only illegally operating parking lots, but were charging exorbitant rates. Officials have been asked to carry out a survey to ascertain the number of malls, markets and hospitals in East Delhi that are charging for parking. Once the survey is done, the Mayor said that legal notice would be sent to the establishments asking them to make their parking facilities free of charge.The EDMC has 35 parking lots of its own where the rates are between Rs.20 to Rs.100, depending on the duration of use. Malls and hospitals charge users a lot more.
