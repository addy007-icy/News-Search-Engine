ailure of monsoon and the consequential lack of water in irrigation projects and steep depletion of groundwater table have taken a heavy toll on the production of foodgrains in Telangana State this year as the estimates show a fall in production by over 30 per cent, compared to last year.The production of foodgrains including cereals, millets and pulses has been estimated to be about 49.35 lakh tonnes in the current (2015-16) agriculture year as against 71.24 lakh tonnes last year. According to official sources, a sharp decrease in the production of paddy, the staple food in the State, has pulled down the total produce of food crops. Paddy output is estimated to less than 30 lakh tonnes this year as against over 44 lakh tonnes last year.Similarly, the production of pulses is estimated to be 2.5 lakh tonnes this year against 2.57 lakh tonnes last year. It is no better for oilseeds either as the officials of the Economics and Statistics (Planning) Department have estimated their production to register a decline of over 2.14 lakh tonnes this year. Their production is likely to be 4.73 lakh tonnes against 6.87 lakh tonnes last year.“Sharp fall in the production of foodgrains and oilseeds has become certain by the end of kharif season itself with no water for crops this year in major irrigation sources – Sriramsagar and Nagarjunasagar projects. Except for some medium irrigation projects and tanks in Khammam, Adilabad and parts of Warangal district, the remaining areas have experienced paucity of rain resulting in drought conditions in over half (233) of the mandals in the State”, a senior official of the Agriculture Department said explaining the reasons for poor production.Cultivation of food crops had seen a sharp fall in kharif by over 6.13 lakh hectares (15.32 lakh acres).The total extent of cultivation was down by 5.65 lakh ha with all crops raised in 35.78 lakh ha against the season normal of 41.43 lakh ha.The prospects in rabi season appear to be even worse with cultivation of food crops taken up only in 3.88 lakh ha against 6.31 lakh ha normal by the end of January third-week.Paddy is the worst-hit crop with its transplantation taken up only 36 per cent of the normal extent.
