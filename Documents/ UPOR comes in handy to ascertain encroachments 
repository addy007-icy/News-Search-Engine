The Urban Property Ownership Record (UPOR) being implemented as a pilot project in the city has come in handy to ascertain encroachment of government and private lands.The UPOR project director in Mysuru Prasad Kulkarni told The Hindu that nearly 250 acres of government land has been reclaimed so far over the last few years, following the completion of the survey as part of the project.The encroachments pertained to foreshores of what were once lakes like Malalvadikere, besides the feeder channels of Kukkarahalli lake. The UPOR was launched as a pilot project in Mysuru in 2010, under which the property records are being digitised complete with spatial details, land area, built area, history of transactions, and mutations in records if any.Property owners are issued Form Number 13, which is the urban equivalent of Record of Rights, Tenancy and Crops for rural properties.Besides identifying encroachment, the survey and spatial data base generated has also come in handy for registration of properties whose records are questionable.The UPOR in the city has issued 1,19, 223 draft documents to property owners, which will be converted to final document or UPOR certificate in case the details are found to be in order and there are no objections from the owners. So far, about 25,000 to 30,000 final certificates have been issued in the city.SurveyThe survey held as part of the UPOR project documented 3,15,566 properties in the project area, which includes Mysuru city and 42 villages coming under it. The 42 surrounding villages were included in anticipation of the future growth and horizontal expansion of the city.Mr. Kulkarni said UPOR certificates for apartment owners too had been streamlined
