As many as 73 houses were locked, 20 were illegally occupied, one was unoccupied, six had collapsed and two were abandoned. In the meeting, it was decided to allot and build houses for 86 beneficiaries in the first phase. The others will be allotted houses after an inquiry about their eligibility,” he said.Mr. Chikkatumbal said that a verification committee comprising municipal officials, councillor and others had been constituted to look into the complaints, if any, against the remaining 102 beneficiaries and the committee had been asked to complete verification within a month.He said that January 20 had been fixed as the deadline for the residents to vacate their houses. “We have been asked to wait for five months for construction and allotment of alternative houses,” he said.
