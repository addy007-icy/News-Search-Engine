Dealing with bounced cheques will no longer be tedious, with the government notifying changes to the negotiable instruments law on Tuesday.One of the main amendments cleared by Parliament in the winter session deals with where a cheque-bounce case can be filed.While the original Act stipulated that the case be filed only where the cheque was issued, the amendment says it can be filed only where it was deposited. This should help expedite resolution of cheque-bounce cases since the aggrieved party need not travel to the issuerâ€™s location to file a case. Estimates peg the number of cheque-bounce cases in India at 18 lakh, 38,000 of which are pending in the High Courts.The provisions of the amended Act are to come into force with retrospective effect from June 15, 2015, the Ministry of Finance said in a notification.
