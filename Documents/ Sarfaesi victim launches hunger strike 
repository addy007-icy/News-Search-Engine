Hours after a team of Revenue and police officers attempted to evict hi from the residence he had allegedly occupied by force, P.D. Ravi, a Dalit and a victim of the ‘loan mafia’ in Panambukadu near Kochi, launched a hunger strike on Thursday.The protest, seeking action against the loan mafia, comes even as the Samithy fighting against attachment proceedings by banks under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (Sarfaesi Act), is slated to hold a discussion with District Collector M.G. Rajamanickam.According to the Samithy, the strike was part of the hunger protest being observed by the victims for the past 102 days. “Despite a series of official reports against it, the government is still neglecting the victims of this draconian act. There is no other way we can bring the issue to the attention of the authorities concerned,” said P.J. Manuel, coordinator of the Samithy.Activists of the Samithy poured kerosene over their bodies in self-defence and stopped the police from forcibly evicting a landless family from their place of residence on Wednesday. The situation was defused about five hours later when the Revenue authorities assured the agitators that a meeting would be convened with the District Collector to sort out the issue.Members of nearly 25 families, who claim that they had been cheated by the loan mafia, have been on a sit-in protest in front of the Ernakulam District Collectorate for the past five months against attachment of their properties under the Sarfaesi Act. According to them, they have been cheated by the mafia in connivance with certain bank officials.The Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe Commission, while considering the case about six months ago, noted that the mafia had bagged rich dividends and properties in the metro town, and called for a probe in this direction. The State government, however, is yet to act upon it.
