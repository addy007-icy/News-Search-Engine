The centenary clock tower on the Manasagangotri campus of the University of Mysore turned into a major attraction for delegates of the 103rd Indian Science Congress which started on Sunday.In memory of their visit to Mysuru, delegates and other visitors took a selfie with the clock tower in the backdrop.Despite the huge rush around the clock tower, as it happened to be closer to the amphitheatre, the main venue of ISC-2015, and the mega food court, the undeterred delegates (some of them had accompanied with their families) took selfies with the clock tower, which was recently installed by the university as part of the centenary fete.As there was huge rush for lunch at the food court, the delegates, while waiting in the queue, managed to click pictures of the clock tower, which stands at 72 feet. This is third such clock in Mysuru after the clock tower near Town Hall and another one near Devaraja Market.
