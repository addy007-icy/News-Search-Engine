In addition to their studies, students attached to the eco club of Thamarakudi Sivavilasam Vocational Higher Secondary School, near Kottarakara, are now engaged in a mission to counter the onslaught of native and exotic invasive plants that have started threatening the Stateâ€™s ecology in an alarming manner.During field studies undertaken during Christmas holidays, they noticed that sacred groves also face threat from such invasive species. These creepers engulf the canopy of native trees and choke them to death by denying sunlight. Many sacred groves are facing death because of this phenomenon.The students are now engaged in rooting out this threat from the sacred groves of Kulakada and Mylom grama panchayats, near Kottarakara. They are also engaged in spreading awareness among people in the panchayats of the need to root out the invasive plants.The students spread this by showing the people the destructive plants.They also play a 30-minute documentary film in the villages so that people can identify the invasive plants better. The film was produced by Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi. Twenty-four shrubs and 15 climbers are identified as most invasive by students.
