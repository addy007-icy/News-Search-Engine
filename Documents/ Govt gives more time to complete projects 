The Centre has granted more time to developers of 13 special economic zones (SEZ), including Navi Mumbai SEZ, to implement their projects. An inter-ministerial board of approval for SEZs had taken this decision on December 30. The validity period of the formal approval given to Navi Mumbai SEZ Pvt Ltd has been extended by a year from October 24, 2015 to complete IT/ITeS SEZs at Ulwe, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. The board also approved two proposals — from ValueLabs Infra LLP and GAR Corporation — for establishing IT/ITeS SEZs in Telangana.
