The services of around 2,500 volunteers of the National Cadet Corps, Student Police Cadets, Bharat Scouts and Guides, National Service Scheme, Junior Red Cross, 2,000 teachers from across the State and 800 ministerial staff from the Education Department made the State School Arts Festival stand apart and helped the government keep expenditure under check.It was on the shoulders of this strong workforce that the seven-day mega event ran like clockwork. While volunteers from student centric organisations were tasked with crowd management, ensuring that venues remained plastic-free, stage operation and other odd jobs, the teachers formed the vital part of committees such as programme, accommodation, finance, transport, and light and sound. But the commendable work of teachers at the Oottupura (kitchen), on par with professional caterers, was the highlight of the festival, like in previous editions.“It’s a service that we do willingly and with pleasure. During meetings held prior to the conduct of the arts festival, suggestions crop up on handing over the task of running the festival to an event management company. But when we pointed to the amount of money that could be saved from the deployment of teachers at the kitchen, the suggestions to rope in event managers were dropped,” K. Buhari, State secretary of the All Kerala School Teachers Union, said.Around 600 teachers worked every day in the mess, serving food to an estimated 20,000 people. “If the same amount of workforce were to be outsourced for seven days, the overall cost involved in conducting the festival would have gone up by a few lakhs,” Mr. Buhari said.The duties rendered by around 1,000 personnel from the Police Department, 150 doctors, 200 staff of the City Corporation and dozens of employees from the Kerala State Electricity Board were also noteworthy.
