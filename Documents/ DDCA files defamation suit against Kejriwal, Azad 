The Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) has filed defamation suits in the Delhi High Court against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Kirti Azad for allegedly making defamatory remarks against the sports body.According to DDCA treasurer Ravinder Manchanda, a civil defamation suit against Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Azad has been filed claiming damages of Rs. 2.5 crore against each.“The CM and Kirti Azad have put our association to disrepute with such baseless allegations of sexual favour and exchange of money for selection. We would like to know who asked for sexual favours and from whom. We have never heard of any selector asking for sexual favours or money for picking a player (in the age group teams). Let them give us evidence. You can't make such outrageous charges without proof,” Mr. Manchanda told The Hindu .Mr. Kejriwal had claimed that a senior journalist had brought to his notice the matter of a selector in DDCA seeking sexual favour for picking his son.Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also filed a criminal defamation case in a Delhi court against Mr. Kejriwal and five senior Aam Aadmi Party leaders.

It has also sought Mr. Jaitley’s resignation on the ground that several financial irregularities took place in the cricket body when during his tenure as its chairperson.The AAP had also alleged that the raid on Mr. Kejriwal’s office was an attempt to cover corruption activities in the DDCA.Union Minister Arun Jaitley has also filed a defamation case against Kejriwal
