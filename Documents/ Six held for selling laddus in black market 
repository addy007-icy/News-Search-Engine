The police on Monday arrested six persons for their alleged involvement in the black marketeering of laddus at the hill temple.Even though the TTD has imposed several restrictions in the past to contain the black marketeering of laddus, it continues and the offenders adopted new modus operandi this time.According to the police, though the incident occurred a couple of days ago, it came to light only on Monday when Srivari Seva volunteers deployed at the counters lodged a complaint with the temple officials with regard to missing of three laddu trays.The volunteers, entrusted with the responsibility of counting the number of trays entering the counters and those being brought out, are deployed by the TTD as a measure to check the staff from adopting unlawful practices.TTD JEO Srinivasa Raju verified the CCTV footage and found that the accused took away three trays of laddus on the pretext of carrying back the emptied trays. Even though each tray consisted of fifty laddus, 152 laddus were missing. On questioning, all the six accused confessed to the crime and admitted to have sold them in the black market double the original price of Rs.25 each.
