The idea of Sharira as a whole is a crystallisation of abstract principles like sexuality, femininity and spirituality, which combines together with a body performance, said Sadanand Menon, art critic and show director of the dance drama Sharira , of the Chandralekha Group.During ‘Meet the Artist’ session at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala on Monday, the artistes on and behind the stage of Chandralekha’s dance drama Sharira were interacting with the audience about the political discourse of the drama.While recollecting the process building of the 15-year-old Sharira , the last work of famous dancer late Chandralekha, Mr. Menon, show director of Chandralekha theatres, navigated the audience through the unique experience starting from the initial choreography and later finding the music for Sharira . Around six years, the artists worked without music and then they started working with Drupad, he noted.Music of leading Dhrupad exponents, Umakant and Ramakant Gundecha, has taken the drama to a higher level.“Chandralekha has a style of sleeping over an idea till its saturation and maturation, and it will blend the moment and meaning together,” said Mr. Menon.Performing artist Tishani Doshi explained how the music from Gundecha Brothers integrated with the physical movements and transformed the play. “I was a writer when I came back to India. When I started with Chandralekha I didn’t know my body have such capabilities,” Tishani noted.Tishani’s long-term working chemistry with counterpart and martial arts performer Shaji John was not male-female or Radha-Krishna, but was just representation of ‘bodies’, the actors explained.The late Chandralekha stressed the need for re-integrating the diverse Indian physical tradition and exploring contemporary directions for dance. Her works highlighted the unity of dance and other physical disciplines such as kalairipayattu and yoga.
