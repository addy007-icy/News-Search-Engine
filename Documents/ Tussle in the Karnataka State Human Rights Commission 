The Karnataka State Human Rights Commission has asked for the removal of the head of the police wing for his activities that have been considered as being against the commission.Meera Saxena, acting chairperson of the commission that sees nearly 5000 cases lodged yearly, said on Wednesday that the members had recommended to the State government to “repatriate” (that is, transfer), Additional Director General of Police N. Shivakumar from the post.While proceedings for the removal had started nearly two weeks ago, the commission took the resolution on Saturday.“Since the appointment nearly eight months ago, there have been only a handful of raids or reports from the officer while complains surge,” said Ms. Saxena. She added that in most cases, other officers such as the Public Relations Officer or court officers had to be empowered to do the raids or reports to ensure complaints do not pile up.While the commission has given him warnings, the tipping point seems to be letters written by Mr. Shivakumar to the police department asking for the repatriation of numerous officers who had been deputed to the personal staff of the Chairperson. This included gunmen for the Chairperson, office staff and even the operator of the toll-free helpline.In response, Mr. Shivakumar told The Hindu that he has “promptly” conducted all investigations referred to him. “I asked for the police personnel to be transferred as they were doing menial jobs and not investigation work at the commission,” he said.
