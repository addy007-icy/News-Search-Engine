Fast bowler >Mohammed Shami, hoping to return to international cricket after a nine-month injury layoff, pulled his hamstring on Friday.The Hindu has come to understand that Shami hurt himself ahead of the warm-up game and was unable to bowl as a result. Confirming the injury, a BCCI insider revealed that a final decision on Shami’s availability will be taken on Saturday.“He suffered an injury during the team’s training and is being monitored. Based on the medical advice on Saturday, it will be decided whether he will continue to be a part of the squad or not,” the source said.Shami played the latter half of last year’s World Cup through pain, thus aggravating his knee injury.
