Members of the Malabar Development Forum staged a protest in front of the office of Air India in the city on Saturday to demand restoration of A 321 aircraft service in the Calicut-Sharjah-Dubai sector.The A 321 aircraft with a larger carrying capacity (both passenger and cargo) had been withdrawn and an A 320 aircraft is being operated in this sector.Members of the forum said at the protest venue that sea food and farm produce exports from this region had been severely hit because the A 320 aircraft had far less cargo capacity.Frequent flyers in this sector were inconvenienced by lesser seats.Business classThe high-end flyers were disappointed as there was no business class in this aircraft.Forum chairman and Panchayats Minister M.K. Muneer said the region would stand as one to get all the withdrawn flights back at Calicut Airport.The protesters also put forward to other airliners and the Airports Authority of India the major demand of this region that direct Haj services should resume from Calicut International Airport.The runway works had led to the diversion of the large aircraft of various operators to Nedumbassery.Forum working chairman K.M. Basheer said this had inconvenienced a large number of Haj pilgrims.From MalabarThe bulk of the total number of pilgrims from the State were always from the Malabar region.But, last year, the diversion of the flights forced these people to take an arduous road trip to Nedumbassery to board the flights. “We have around 7,500 Haj pilgrims from Kerala every year.And, 70 per cent of the pilgrims are from Malabar region- from Kasaragod to Thrissur,” said secretary of Calicut Chamber of Commerce Abdullah Maliyekal, expressing support for the protest.“We are optimistic that the runway works will be over by August this year, and the runway will be open to the large flights in time for the Haj in September,” Mr. Maliyekal said.AppealStating that Saturday’s protest was for a significant common cause of this region, Malabar Chamber of Commerce president C. Mohan said that in addition to requesting the AAI for speedy completion of the runway works, an appeal would have to be made to the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation to resume the services thereafter.
