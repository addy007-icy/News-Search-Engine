Confidence about near-term sales growth among chief executives around the world has fallen to its lowest level in six years as China’s economic engine slows and a slump in oil prices signals deep unease about the global outlook.A survey of over 1,400 CEOs released on Tuesday, on the eve of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, paints a gloomy picture, as corporate leaders contemplate a rising tide of threats.Stimulus and easy moneyDespite the trillions of dollars of stimulus and ultra-easy money that central banks have pumped into the system since the 2008 financial crash, just 27 per cent of CEOs expect global economic growth to improve over the next 12 months, compared with 37 per cent at the same time last year.China, whose demand helped bring the world back from the brink last time around, is at the centre of concerns.“You’ve got the second largest economy in the world that until now has seen very, very good growth rates when many others were really struggling, and now we are seeing a real slowdown,” said Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which conducted the annual corporate health check.
