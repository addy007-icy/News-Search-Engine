Cautioning the government against implementing the proposed development plans of Chamundi Hills, the Mysuru Grahakara Parishat (MGP) has come out with alternative solutions.It said instead of catering for parking of more private vehicles at the top of the hills by constructing a multi-level parking lot, visiting devotees and tourists should be provided with regular public transport vehicles. Bus services and stopping private vehicles at the helipad of Lalitha Mahal grounds during Ashada Ekadashi and Dasara have proven successful, and a similar arrangement can be provided to protect the flora and fauna of the hills, it said.R. Chandra Prakash, MGP president, and Maj. Gen. Sudhir Vombatkere (retd), social activist, said that pilgrims should be encouraged to return to Mysuru after visiting, rather than staying overnight at the top. This will also help the hotel industry within Mysuru city.The proposal of the planners to develop Chamundi Hills as a tourism destination on the lines of Tirupati was questionable. It said an increase in the people who stay atop Chamundi Hills would adversely affect its ecological balance and religious serenity.The MGP suggested that the funds proposed for the “development works” could instead be invested to strengthen the existing assets on the top of Chamundi Hills, and institute a regular system (including permanently employing empowered Inspectors) to prevent pollution and to handle the wastes generated at present.
