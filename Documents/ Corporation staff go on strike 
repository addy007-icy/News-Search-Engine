Thousands of sanitation workers, teachers, engineers, doctors, nurses and managerial staff of the Capital’s municipal corporations went on a one-day strike on Thursday to demand their salaries. The cash-strapped North and East Delhi civic bodies have been unable to pay employees for three to four months, forcing workers to come out on the streets in protest. Workers from zonal offices made their way to Civic Centre – the headquarters of the North and South civic bodies – to hold a dharna.“We have become like a football for the authorities. The corporations kick us towards the Delhi Government, which kicks us towards the Centre,” said Rajendra Mewati, the general secretary of the United Front of MCD Employees.
