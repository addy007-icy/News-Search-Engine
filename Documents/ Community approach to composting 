Last September, Avvai Home, decided to do something about the waste generated in their institution premises.The home for less privileged girls and women was generating a lot of it. “We cook every day for 195 people and earlier, we would just dispose of all our garbage.But I wanted to use our kitchen waste for a vegetable garden,” says V. Susheela, secretary of the home.And so, they set up composting units, into which their garbage goes and is converted as compost. “It’s been coming out very well. The rains delayed our gardening project, but we are planning to set it up soon,” she says.Every day, the city disposes of nearly 5,000 tonnes of garbage. Most of this is un-segregated and is dumped in the massive landfills in Pallikaranai and Kodungaiyur.Avvai Home, says Navneeth Raghavan of Daily Dump which sells and sets up community composting units called Aaga, is one of many organisations that are now expressing an interest in composting their waste.
