Speakers at a meeting organised by the CPI (M) Kothagudem division committee at Punukuduchelka village in Kothagudem mandal on Tuesday expressed concern over the proposal to set up a Greenfield airport at the village, citing ‘socio-economic, environmental and livelihood’ issues.Several speakers deplored that the move to establish an airport at the village, predominantly inhabited by tribal people, would tantamount to depriving tribal people of lands and livelihood besides violating the forest and tribal laws, according to sources.However, they maintained that they were not opposing the airport, but only want it to come up at some other suitable site near Kothagudem, devoid of any issues.The CPI (M) division leader Satyanarayana said the move to set up an airport at Punukuduchelka would not only displace several tribal families but also amount to violation of tribal acts.It is mandatory to obtain the consent of tribal people of the Agency area for any such proposal as per the provisions of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Area (PESA) Act, 1996, he contended.The authorities should identify some other suitable site near Kothagudem town for the proposed airport to avoid displacement of tribal people at Punukuduchelka, he said.Earlier, a CPI (M) delegation comprising the party district secretary P Sudarshan Rao and Bhadrachalam MLA Sunnam Rajaiah visited Punukuduchelka and its adjoining habitations under Mylaram gram panchayat.They interacted with local residents mainly comprising tribal people on the reported proposal of the government to set up an airport in 1,600 acres of land at Punukuduchelka.A section of the villagers reportedly raised apprehensions that the proposed project would deprive them of their traditional livelihood and cause pollution problems.The CPI(M) delegation assured them that the party will highlight their concerns at various forums and strive to safeguard their interests.The move to set up an airport at Punukuduchelka will also amount to violation of tribal acts, says CPI (M) division leader
