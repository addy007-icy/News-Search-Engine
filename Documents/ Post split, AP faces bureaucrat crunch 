: Andhra Pradesh is facing bureaucrat crunch, more so at the level of Principal Secretaries as even after one and a half years after the bifurcation due to delay in rationalisation and restructuring of departments.The problem as a consequence is two-fold. While some officers are burdened to handle two to three key departments, other senior officials who could do with more responsibilities head sub-departments in the Secretariat.Thus there is no proper distribution of work to get optimum work from every senior bureaucrat, admit government sources. For instance, senior IAS officer Ajay Jain handles Energy, Infrastructure and Investments and subsequently given the responsibility of the Capital Region Development Authority as well under MA & UD. On the contrary departments like Revenue and Finance has three secretaries each.In addition, senior officers like Giridhar, Soloman Raj have been waiting to go on deputation to Centre .The sources said that for a bifurcated State like Andhra Pradesh, cadre review and notifying the designations and administrative hierarchy should have been the priority but not done so far.Telangana State relatively was quick in this regard and prevailed upon Union government to allot it more IAS officers at the junior level during allocation of IAS cadre to the States.Andhra Pradesh for some reason did not go for restructuring of departments though a committee of senior officials before bifurcation of combined State submitted a report to rationalise the number of departments and officials by clubbing related wings of a department and put them under one or two secretaries depending on the size of the department.Another drawback was as the cadre became top heavy, subjects under one department had been segregated and handed over to different senior officials like in revenue, finance. This was also the case with directorates and offices of head of departments.Some reliefSenior bureaucrats recall that when they had joined the service, there were not so many departments. The State government got a reprieve recently as it got some 10 to 12 officers from IRS, customs etc., on deputation from Central service and the Group of Ministers has been entrusted to look into restructuring of departments and give its report.Delay in rationalisation, restructuring of departments leads to the situation
