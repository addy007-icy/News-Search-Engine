Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi has decided to drop a $3.3 million civil law suit against Chris Cairns in connection with a match-fixing scandal — a major reprieve for the New Zealand all-rounder who was recently cleared of any wrongdoing in a perjury trial.“He’s decided to bring the civil matter to a close and draw a line under it,” Modi’s lawyer Rajesh Vyakarnam told the New Zealand Herald.Modi had lost to Cairns in a 2012 court battle after the administrator was sued by the Kiwi player for claiming that he was involved in match-fixing in the now-defunct Indian Cricket League.Cairns was later accused of lying under oath in this trial but was cleared of the charge in a perjury case in the U.K. last year.Modi had, in 2010, tweeted that Cairns had been left out from the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction due to his “past record of match-fixing.”
