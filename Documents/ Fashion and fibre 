How many of us know our saris well enough? Know the weaver who wove them? The process involved? More importantly, do we know what the sari means to the weaver? These were some of the lines of thought at Warp And Weft: Let’s Talk Textiles, organised by organic cotton brand Ethicus, recently at Kanakavalli, Kingsley.The panel comprised textile revivalist Ratna Krishnakumar, renowned for her work with weavers in Banaras and for Aranya, her project involving natural dyes; Anaka Narayanan of Brass Tacks, Chennai, who predominantly uses hand-woven fabrics in modern silhouettes; and Vijayalakshmi Nachiar of Ethicus. Engaging them in conversation was Prabha Nagarajan, who works with natural dyes through her brand Prana.The setting at Kingsley was perfect. Banaras saris, featuring designs that have been revived, framed the stage and fluttered gently in the breeze. Mango blossoms showered down and scented the air — it was all in keeping with the theme of getting back to Nature.Anaka, wearing a jacket designed from her grandmother’s Kanjeevaram sari, spoke about the process of contemporarising hand-woven textiles into something the present generation would pick up.  Vijayalakshmi detailed the journey of Ethicus, of how they decided to create a product that stayed true to its roots, yet possessed that extra edge in the form of detailing. Ratna narrated the story of weavers in Banaras – the most moving segment of it all.Ratna got the weavers to make saris for the staff at Taj properties, and sent them photos of the girls wearing them. They immediately hung them alongside their gods — that’s how much they revere the loom and what it creates. Says Ratna, “I went back and told the girls that this is what the sari means to the weaver, and that they must cherish it the same way.”(Ethicus also inaugurated its new store at Kanakavalli, Indira Nagar, Adyar.)
