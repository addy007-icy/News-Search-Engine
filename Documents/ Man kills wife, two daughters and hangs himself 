A scrap dealer poisoned his wife and two daughters before hanging himself to death reportedly owing to financial problems at his house in Sitarambagh on Monday morning.According to the police, N Balraj (30) lived along with his wife Narva Surekha (25) and 18-month-old twins Medha and Megha at a rented house in the Afzalsagar area of Mallepally under Habeebnagar police station area. Balraj’s mother Maniamma and brother Prem also lived along with them. On Sunday evening, Balraj along with his family after having dinner went to his room to sleep.On Monday morning, as the family did not come out of their room, Maniamma repeatedly knocked at their door. As there was no answer, Prem and other neighbours peeped into the room through a window and found Balraj hanging to the ceiling in the room.Shocked, people broke open the door and found Surekha lying on the floor while the girls were found on the bed in an unconscious state.“Balraj removed the ceiling fan and hanged himself with a cable wire to the ceiling. Before ending life, we suspect he fed his children and wife poison-laced food,” Inspector of Habeebnagar R Sanjay Kumar said. Family members told the police that he was facing financial problems.
