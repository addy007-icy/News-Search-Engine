Even the dogs are not spared of racism. This was precisely why some young animal lovers from the city got together with a pledge to find home for native breeds besides, create awareness among the citizens. An NGO, A Place To Bark, conducted an adoption drive at exhibition grounds where 37 puppies of indigenous breeds got a new family.“People want only dogs of exotic breeds as pets and look at it as a status symbol,” said Md. Zabi Khan, founder of A Place To Bark. “We are trying to explain people that all pet dogs love their owners in the same way. Native dogs have great immunity, require low maintenance and are excellent guard animals.”The puppies between the age group of two to three months caught the fancy of many youngsters. According to the volunteers conducting the drive, there will post-adoption checks to make sure that the pets are well taken care of. “Those interested in adopting the pets need to fill in a form. We also take their ID proof and house address. After a week, we will check and see if the pet is being taken good care of. If not we can take back the animal which is a condition we mentioned in the application form,” said Mr. Khan.
