Allocation of posts for senior doctors based-on Kamalnathan Committee recommendations has not gone down well with the members of Telangana Government Doctors Association (TGDA). Citing ‘injustice’ in allocation of posts, senior doctors from Telangana on Wednesday boycotted their regular duties and protested in front of the officer of the Director of Medical Education (DME).Outpatient services at Osmania General Hosptial (OGH), Gandhi Hosptial, Government Chest Hosptial, Erragadda and Niloufer Hospital were crippled, as senior doctors joined the protests. They demanded suspension of the DME and urged the State Government to reconsider the allocation of posts to doctors hailing from Andhra Pradesh.“In all, TS has to receive 2,446 posts of doctors but according to the reallocation, only 2173 posts have been filled. Moreover, there are instances in which doctors from Andhra Pradesh, who did not opt for Telangana, have been posted to Telangana. This is sheer injustice and we demand immediate suspension of the DME,” the protesting TGDA members said.Threaten to boycott dutiesThe senior doctors from TGDA, in addition to staying away from outpatient services, also threatened to boycott emergency duties in the next few days if the allocation list is not revised.Senior doctors familiar with the issue pointed out that tertiary hospitals from Telangana will stand to lose Post Graduate medical seats if doctors from AP are transferred.Meanwhile, the senior doctors from TGDA have decided to further intensify the protests by boycotting outpatient services in all the tertiary hospitals in Telangana district.
