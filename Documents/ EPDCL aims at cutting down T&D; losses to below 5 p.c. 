In 2016, the Andhra Pradesh Eastern Power Distribution Corporation Limited (APEPDCL), which caters to the requirements of the five coastal districts, will focus on bringing down the transmission and distribution loss to below 5 per cent.The Discom has been recording the lowest T&D losses since the last few years.In 2013-14, it recorded a loss of about 7.09 per cent, in 2014-15 it dropped further to 6.87 per cent, and in 2015-16 it recorded an all-time low of 6.32 per cent.“Our target is to bring it down to below 5 per cent this year and we are working on many initiatives,” said Chairman and Managing Director R. Mutyala Raju.To begin with, the entire Discom area is segregated into 20 divisions, and each division is divided into 309 sectors.“The segregation is done basically to focus on the weaker sectors. We will also be adding another 60 new sub-stations, which will add another 400 MVA of power and reduce the length of the LT lines by about 20 per cent. And this will reduce the losses further,” he said.Power to allThis apart, the Discom is nearing its target of providing power to all under its fold.“We have five districts under our control and over 50 lakh consumers. Power is yet to reach about 1.29 lakh households located in the remotest parts of the Agency areas of Paderu in Visakhapatnam district, Rampachodavaram in East Godavari, Parvathipuram in Vizianagaram, and Seetampeta in Srikakulam districts. By March, work will be completed and power supplied to all the houses. About 10,000 villages or hamlets will be covered under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana,” he said.According to Mr. Mutyala Raju, the Discom is working towards fulfilling the promise of 24/7 power to all and continuous seven-hour power to farmers.“The 24/7 power is likely to be a reality this year. Farmers too will get continuous seven-hour supply,” he told The Hindu .He also said that the underground cabling network would be grounded in February or March.“The DPR is ready and in February we are going for tenders. Once the tenders are floated and finalised, World Bank will release 5 per cent of the total funds as mobilisation fund,” he said. The Discom and the State government will chip in with minor shares.The total project cost is estimated at Rs.719.48 crore. About 7,000 km of cross-linked polyethylene cable will be laid across the city in three phases under the project.We are working on initiatives such as adding new sub-stations and reducing the length of LT lines to achieve the purposeR.
