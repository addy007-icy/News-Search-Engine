High Court Judge Vilas V. Afzulpurkar on Friday inaugurated a video linkage room facility on the premises of the Courts Complex at Madanapalle.Speaking on the occasion, Mr Afzulpurkar and District and Sessions Judge (Chittoor) T. Anand said that as part of the ongoing computerisation of the judiciary under guidance of the Supreme Court, the pilot project of linking prisons with court houses was undertaken for which 37 places in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had been identified.The video linkage between jail and court at Madanapalle is the first assignment undertaken as part of the project.“The new facility will be put for extension of remands, and it is planned to extend the same for recording of evidence and addressing arguments,” the Judges said.The video linkage would certainly obviate the government of the ordeals of transportation of prisoners from jail to court and relieve the burden of staff constraints with the Prison Department. It would further help timely disposal of the cases too, they observed.The facility will be used for extension of remands and plans afoot to extend the same for recording of evidence and addressing argumentsThe new facility will be used for extension of remands as of nowPlans afoot to extend the same for recording of evidence and addressing arguments
