: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) will soon send notices to the Directorate of Medical Education and the Health Department Secretary seeking their response on a proposal to start a full-fledged cardiology centre and a Cath-lab at the Ernakulam Government Medical College.Considering a petition by the Collegeâ€™s House Surgeons Association in this regard, the Commission sought detailed reports from both the entities before its next sitting, slated for February 22.As per the complaint, several cardiac patients visited the hospital on a daily basis.But the cardiology department at the hospital functioned only three days a week, that too with a single doctor.
