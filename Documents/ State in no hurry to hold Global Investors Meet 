Global investors meet (GIM) may fast be becoming a preferred forum for more and more States across the country to reach out to potential investors, but Telangana seems to be in no hurry to host the event.Although a GIM figures in its scheme of things, the State government is unlikely to give shape to the plan anytime soon. It will happen next year, says Industries Secretary Arvind Kumar, expecting the meet to be held either towards 2016-end or in early 2017. Behind the decision, not to rush ahead with what would also be the State’s first GIM is an eagerness to leverage the industrial policy as well as the measures to improve the ease of doing business unveiled alongside.Top initiativeOne such initiative that has come in for appreciation is the Right to Clearances, assuring time-bound approvals, and a penalty on officials responsible for delaying them.With the policy launched only six months ago, the thinking in the government is to give more time for awareness of the industry-friendly measures to grow and consolidate the gains. An apparent change in the plans, since IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao had in April indicated of a GIM in January 2016, could also be due to less than the desired pick up in economic growth.Notwithstanding the situation, quite a few States, however, went ahead or will soon hold GIM or GIM-like events to woo global investors.

Such an approach of not making it one more GIM also stems from the fact that the prospective “investors have only so much time and appetite (for investments).” Hence, the emphasis on having everything in place before going all out.Government eager to see awareness of the industry-friendly measures grow so as to consolidatethe gains
