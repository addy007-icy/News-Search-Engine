The CPI has demanded that the Governor system be scrapped in the wake of dismissal of Arunachal Pradesh Government.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, CPI national secretary K. Narayana said that the toppling of the Arunachal Pradesh Government through the institution of the Governor was testimony to abuse of the system by the government. The Modi Government was politically intolerant and was misusing office of the Governor to destabilise non-BJP State governments, he alleged. The CPI leader was insistent that the issue be reviewed threadbare.It was a burden on the State exchequer. A look at the history shows that the Governors had more often than not subverted the spirit of the Constitution.The dismissal of the Arunachal Pradesh Government once again would exert unbearable strain on the federal character of the Constitution, he said. Dr. Narayana, referring to Vemula Rohith’s suicide, took strong objection to Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu inquiring about the caste of the deceased. “It was an unnecessary discussion on whether it was a death of a Dalit. But, it was a death of a scientist in a university. The governments should be sensitive to it,” he said. Dr. Narayana said: “Every political party has a way of addressing the issue. The political party should find a solution to problem, create awareness among public, and derive some benefit out of the issue.”The Modi Government is politically intolerant and misusing the office of the Governor to destabilise non-BJP governmentsK.
