A Sikh man along with his four friends, who were kicked out from an American Airlines flight because their appearance made the captain uneasy has filed a $9 million lawsuit against the airline.Shan Anand, a Sikh, along with three other friends — Faimul Alam besides a Bangladeshi Muslim and an Arab Muslim — were ordered off the flight 44718 from Toronto to New York last month based upon their perceived race, colour and ethnicity.The Bangladeshi Muslim and Arab Muslim were identified only by their initials W.H. and M.K. Anand and Alam switched seats with strangers after boarding, so they could sit next to W.H. and M.K.Several minutes later, a white woman flight attendant asked W.H. to get off the plane, according to the lawsuit.When they asked the flight crew why they were being removed, the flight attendant told them to exit “peacefully” and “demanded” they return to the gate and await further directions.
