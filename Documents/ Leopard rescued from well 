The Forest Department officials rescued a female leopard that had fallen into a well at Kutyar village near Kaup on Wednesday.The leopard had fallen into the well belonging to Girija Mulya at Karmaru Jiddu in Kutyar village. While it is not known exactly when the leopard fell into the well, it was noticed by Ms. Mulya, when she went to fetch water from the well at around 3 p.m. on Tuesday. There was a small cave-like structure inside the well, where the leopard was sitting. She then informed the local people about the presence of the wildcat. They, in turn, alerted the personnel of the Department of Forests. Though the personnel from Shirva, Belman and Udupi tried to lure the leopard out of the well, they failed. On Wednesday morning, the personnel and the local people supplied water from a nearby well into the well where the leopard was sitting. After the water-level increased, the leopard jumped into the cage and got trapped.
