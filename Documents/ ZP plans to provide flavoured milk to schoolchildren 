The Mysuru Zilla Panchayat is contemplating providing flavoured milk to schoolchildren under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme.The zilla panchayat is planning to write to the State government about the need to distribute flavoured milk in schools and request the government to approve it under Ksheera Bhagya and explore the possibility of giving flavoured milk to schoolchildren across the State under the said scheme.The Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru, at the behest of the zilla panchayat, had developed three different flavours of milk powder, including vanilla and badam, ZP president Pushpavati Amarnath told The Hindu.Ms. Amarnath said that the ZP was contemplating this move due to various reasons. Several students were avoiding milk consumption owing to the alleged foul smell and high water content in the milk being provided to them at present. A large number of children, with whom she interacted during a recent visit to villages, wanted the government to provide milk obtained from cattle instead of milk powder, as it gave a foul smell. Also, the parents had complained that the milk being given to their children was low in fat and vitamins.Meanwhile, an official said that the government would incur an additional cost of at least eight to 10 paise a day on each child, if the scheme of providing flavoured milk were to be implemented. Besides, the Karnataka Milk Federation had to give its consent to add flavours to milk powder, the source said.“Whether the government is ready to incur the additional burden is another factor to be considered,” the sources said. Flavoured milk would be given to officials and a few ZP members either on Monday or Tuesday before embarking on its distribution in schools on a trial basis, sources said.If the flavoured milk scheme gets widely accepted by children, then steps would be initiated to implement it in all schools in the district, sources said.Government will also be requested to explore possibility of extending the scheme to entire StateAt the behest of ZP, Central Food Technological Research Institute has brought out three different flavours of milk powderAt present, several students said to be refusing to consume milk owing to ‘foul smell and high water content’People in villages want schoolchildren provided with milk obtained from cattle instead of milk powder
