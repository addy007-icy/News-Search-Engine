R. Revathi, a woman from Kancheepuram, who had gone to Malaysia to work as a domestic help in September, but had not been able to return, is now back home, her son, R. Sriram, said on Thursday. “My mother is back home now. She has become thinner and said she had a difficult time there,” said the 18-year-old.Revathi said it was a terrible experience for her to work there. “The work was not what had been initially agreed upon. First, they told me I could leave in December, and then they said I could not go until they got a replacement. I only managed to get out through the Indian High Commission,” she said.According to S. Srivathsan, a resident of Chennai who had helped her by contacting the Indian High Commission in Kuala Lampur, Revathi arrived on an Air India flight, landing at 12.35 a.m.Officials of the High Commission had facilitated her arrival, he said. She was then dropped off at her home in Kancheepuram.
