It was a pleasant surprise for traffic policemen toiling under the sun at various traffic junctions in Hubballi on Wednesday as they were greeted with ‘thank-you’ cards, poems, sweets and flowers.The surprise came to them through volunteers of Children’s Movement for Civic Awareness (CMCA) and members of Round Table 153, who conducted the event as part of the Traffic Police Day.Beginning from the busy Kittur Chennamma Circle, the volunteers moved to different junctions and handed over the sweets and flowers to the traffic police personnel on duty. At some junctions the surprised policemen turned emotional at the children’s gesture. They said such small gestures motivated them to continue the work they were doing.They also asked the children to adhere to the traffic rules and regulations in the interest of their own safety and not to ride a two-wheeler unless they become eligible for a valid license.The Hubballi-Dharwad wing of CMCA has been organising Traffic Police Day annually and this is the ninth year in the twin cities.
