North Korea’s claim that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday drew swift condemnation from friends and foes alike.In a strongly worded statement, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said: “It is a matter of deep concern that DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] has again acted in violation of its international commitments in this regard. We call upon DPRK to refrain from such actions which adversely impact on peace and stability in the region. Our concerns about proliferation links between North East Asia and our neighbourhood are well-known.”China’s state-run Xinhua news agency said the announcement was “highly regrettable”.“It was a breach of UN resolutions and a blow to the Korean Peninsula denuclearisation process,” it said.
