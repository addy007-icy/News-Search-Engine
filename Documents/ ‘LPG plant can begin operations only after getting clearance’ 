The National Green Tribunalâ€™s Southern Bench here on Wednesday held that the LPG bottling plant of Indian Oil Corporation Limited at Gangaikondan taluk in Tirunelveli district could commence operations only after obtaining environmental clearance and nod from the National Board for Wildlife.The Bench comprising Justice M. Chockalingam and expert member P.S. Rao further disposed off an application by S. P. Muthuraman, who alleged that Indian Oil Corporation Limited had constructed the LPG bottling plant at Gangaikondan without obtaining environmental clearance and sought a direction to authorities not to grant post-facto clearance.Counsel for Indian Oil Corporation Limited Abdul Saleem contended that they took 42 acres of land from SIPCOT on lease for 99 years and further wrote to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) twice in 2012 seeking clarification as to whether environmental clearance was required for their project activity.Though they proceeded with the construction based on the Consent to Establishment issued under Air and Water acts by TNPCB in September last, eventually the Board had issued Consent to Operate.
