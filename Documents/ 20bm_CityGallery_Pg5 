Though Mumbai winters aren’t exactly what you’d define as cold, Foodhall has stocked-up on winter treats. The live kitchen counter has treats like silken tofu and water chestnut khow suey, wild mushroom and barley broth, sweet potato and carrot gratin and a winter vegetable stew. Hot-bowls are available in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and feature dishes like the Malayan laksa with noodles, kung pao tofu or chicken or smoked chicken burrito bowls and deconstructed falafel/ chicken rice bowls.Time: 10:30 am to 10 pmVenue: Foodhall, Lower ParelPhone: 30264581
