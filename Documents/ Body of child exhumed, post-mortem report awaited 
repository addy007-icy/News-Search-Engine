The body of eighteen-month-old Srujan, who died after a pharmacist administered him injections for treating a fever, was exhumed from the burial ground in Hulgunda village near Kushalnagar on Monday and subjected to post-mortem examination.The body was buried again after the post-mortem, which was conducted by forensic medicine experts from Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMC&RI) in the presence of the officials and the parents of the boy. Srujan died at the Government Hospital in Madikeri on January 11, days after Ganapathi, a pharmacist in Koppa, administered him antibiotics without a qualified doctor’s prescription.“The post mortem report is awaited,” Deputy Superintendent of Police, Hunsur, Harish Pande told The Hindu. Sources in MMC&RI said that the sample of the skin, where the antibiotics had been injected, and other routine samples had been collected for pathological and forensic laboratory examination.The post-mortem report, which is likely to be submitted to the police in three to four days time, is expected to throw light on the cause of the boy’s death. “The idea is to ascertain whether the antibiotics administered by the pharmacist led to the boy’s death,” a medical expert said.The boy’s parents Mohan and Kokila, both agricultural labourers, took their sick child to Deshik Medicals, Ganapathi’s pharmacy in Koppa, about 8 km from their village, on January 3. Police said the nearest primary health centre from Hulgunda village is situated in Kushalnagar, about 9 km away. The accused Ganapathi, an ex-serviceman, who was known as “Military doctor” in the area, allegedly administered him injections on January 3, 5 and 7.The boy developed complications and died on January 11, after which his parents lodged a complaint with the Bylakuppe police station on January 16, leading to Ganapathi’s arrest.Chairman of Mysuru unit of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) anti-quackery cell Dr. Arivandam blamed the scarcity of qualified doctors in rural areas for the rise in quacks. He also said there was a need to create awareness against quackery among the rural population.
