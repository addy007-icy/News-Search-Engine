With his objections for most recent projects in forest land being dismissed as being “too general” or “insignificant”, environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy has written to Regional Empowered Committee claiming there was “no point” in continuing as a member.“I have submitted a letter to the government saying there is no purpose of me being in the committee if my views are not considered at all. I had not asked for the post, but was appointed. The committee is there to adopt mitigation measures and not as a rubber-stamp authority to approve every proposal without strict conditions,” he told The Hindu . In the past three months, his objections to proposals for construction of windmills in Gadag, the massive Yettinahole river diversion project, quarrying in the Western Ghats, mangrove felling in Karwar, and opening of a soda factory in Karwar, had been “ignored”. An official of the committee said the resignation had been forwarded to the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
