A 14-year-old boy, who ran away from his house in Guntur district, was rescued by the Childline India Foundation NGO partner HELP from the railway station here on Monday. Yesuratnam, a 8th class student of a school in Varahapuram village near Vemur, decided to run away after his grandfather with whom he was living expressed his inability to fund his studies further, HELP social activist B.V. Sagar said. He boarded the Vijayawada-Ongole passenger train and got down at the railway station here. He was sent to the rescue home ''Asha Sadan'' as ordered by Child Welfare Committee Chairman B.V.S.N.K. Prasad.
