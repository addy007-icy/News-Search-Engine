A 65-year-old was found murdered, allegedly by her debt-ridden grandson, at her Uttam Nagar residence on Tuesday morning.Like the rest of the family, 24-year-old accused Vinay too was present at Munni Devi’s residence following the incident. Thanks to footage from a CCTV camera, the police cracked the case at the spot itself, said an officer.The incident came to light around 11 a.m. when a neighbour visited Munni Devi’s house. She lived alone since her husband’s death and her three children, including Vinay’s mother, lived nearby. “When no one responded, the neighbour entered the house and saw her body. She had been strangulated and hit with a heavy object,” added a police officer.Neighbours informed the police and her son Rajkumar, who was at his Ashok Vihar office. “I was initially told that my mother was injured. I called up my wife and Vinay. He expressed shock and assured me that he will rush her to a hospital immediately ,” Mr. Rajkumar said. When he reached his mother’s house, he saw Vinay consoling other relatives. A police team noticed a CCTV camera at the entrance of a house located right opposite the victim’s residence. “The footage showed Vinay entering the house post-midnight and leaving around 6 a.m.,” said an officer.When confronted, he purportedly admitted to having killed his grandmother. “He revealed that he had recently bought a smartphone by borrowing money from friends and was under a lot of pressure to repay them,” said the officer.
