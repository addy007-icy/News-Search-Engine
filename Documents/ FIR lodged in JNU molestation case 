A case of molestation has been registered against a professor of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) who was sacked from the varsity last month.The professor has been accused of molesting a foreign research scholar pursuing her research under him. The case was registered after the university took the matter to the police. “A case under Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) of IPC has been registered on basis of the woman’s statement submitted before the university,” said a police official.The university had on December 21 terminated services of the professor in the varsity’s Department of Sociology after the varsity’s Gender Sensitization Committee Against Sexual Harassment (GSCASH) found him guilty. After the professor was sacked, the JNU Students Union had approached the administration demanding an FIR be registered against him.On Wednesday, the students marched from the JNU campus to the Vasant Kunj police station demanding an FIR be lodged.
