A section of sanitary workers from two wards on contract has submitted a memorandum to the Collector K. S. Palanisamy, demanding a directive to the City Corporation to disburse their monthly wages.In a memorandum to the Collector here on Monday, they said that they were yet to get a part of the wages for the past few months.They sought the district administration’s immediate intervention to direct the Corporation authorities to ensure prompt disbursement of their wages. One of the workers said that against Rs.4,500, they got just Rs.3,000 towards last month’s wages. They said they were attached to Wards 64 and 65 and their contract term would conclude by February 28. They expressed their apprehension over the ‘possible curtailment’ in wages for the current month too. In all 40 workers were deployed in these wards of whom about 10 workers came to submit a petition to the Collector.
