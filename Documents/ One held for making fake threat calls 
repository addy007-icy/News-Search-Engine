According to Rayagada Superintendent of Police K. Siva Subramani, Dhaneswar had also been arrested in the past in relation to cheating and forest products smuggling cases.Although having no links with the Naxalites, Dhaneswar had started posing as a member of the outlawed Maoist organisation for extortion. On December 31, 2015, he had made threatening call from his cell phone in the name of Maoists to construction contractor P. Ramesh of Pujariguda village under Kalyansinghpur village. Dhaneswar had demanded Rs.5 lakh as protection money. However, Ramesh refused to pay.Dhaneswar, with the help of some other persons, started pasting threatening posters in the name of Maoists in the Sikarpai area.
