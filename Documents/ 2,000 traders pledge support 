: The Trade Wing of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday continued to create awareness in addition to attempting to garner support for the government’s odd-even vehicle-rationing scheme among businessmen and shop owners across the Capital’s prominent markets.Close to 2,000 traders pledged their support for the scheme at Chandni Chowk, Karol Bagh and Kashmere Gate among others by opting for stickers proclaiming that they would only use their vehicles on days allowed by the regulations of the scheme based on odd or even dates, said Brijesh Goel, convenor, AAP Trade Wing.“Businessmen and shop owners form a segment of private vehicle users that cannot do without personal conveyance due to logistical reasons such as carrying significant amounts of cash or moving from one location to another throughout the day,” Mr. Goel said.“Despite these issues, however, close to 2,000 of them have pledged their support and have promised to either use public transport or car pool over the last two days and the number is expected to grow substantially over the next week,” he added.As an incentive, Mr. Goel said, 15 of the participants will be felicitated by Transport Minister Gopal Rai at the conclusion of the 15-day anti-pollution experiment.
