Charmasa Malipatil, State president of the Karnataka Rajya Raith Sangha, has urged the Union and State governments to impose a ban on selling Bt cotton seeds and release a compensation of Rs. 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per acre to each farmer, whose crop was destroyed due to pink bollworm attack. He said that crops on around 60,000 hectares were damaged in Raichur district alone.Addressing at a press conference here in Yadgir on Tuesday, Mr. Malipatil said that scientists from University of Agriculture Sciences in Raichur had submitted a report to the State government saying that only 40 per cent to 50 percent of crop was damaged due to pink bollworm attack. But in reality, there more than 80 per cent of crop was destroyed. Hence, the State government should conduct a resurvey to ascertain the exact loss, he said.To discuss the problems facing by farmers, the KRRS would hold a State-level conference of cotton growers in Raichur on January 24.
