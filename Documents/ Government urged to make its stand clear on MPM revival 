Member of Rajya Sabha Ayanur Manjunath has asked the State government to make its stand clear on the future of Mysore Paper Mills (MPM), a public sector undertaking at Bhadravati.“Harsh Gupta, Managing Director of MPM, has said that the State government has given its consent to hand over the firm to a private company on lease while Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education Kimmane Rathnakar has said that no decision has been taken in this regard, so far. These contradictory statements have created confusion among the workers of MPM,” he said at a press conference here on Wednesday.The indefinite protest being staged by the workers of MPM against the move to subject 1,152 employees to layoff entered 52nd day on Wednesday.The MPM’s management has also plans to withdraw some of the perks being offered to the employees and enforce a ceiling on employers’ contribution to provident fund and reimbursement of medical expenses.It was possible that efforts were on to privatise the firm, he said.Mr. Manjunath expressed his displeasure over what he described as the management employing intimidating tactics against protesting employees. Notices had been issued to some protesting employees, he said.The MPM’s factory and township spreads across an area of 850 acres of land. In addition, the Department of Forest has sanctioned around 20,000 acres of land to MPM for developing captive plantation. If the firm were to be handed over to a private company on lease basis, then the ownership of this land should remain with the government. If a joint venture were to be formed with a private company to run the MPM, then the government should have 51 per cent stake in it so that it could have a decisive role in future on important issues, including the ownership of land and interests of workers, he said.He pressed the government to protect the interests of workers, who had rendered commendable service for the firm. Recent developments had created apprehension in the minds of the employees on their future and the State government should initiate measures to instil confidence among them, he said.It is possible that efforts are on to privatise the Mysore Paper Mills.Ayanur Manjunath,Rajya Sabha Member
