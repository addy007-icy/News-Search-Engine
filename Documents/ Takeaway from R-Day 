At 85, I have seen the dawn of Independence in 1947, the birth of our great Republic in 1950 and the gradual transformation of this nation from an economically weak country, which once faced a shortage of food grain, clothing, communication facilities and other essentials, into an economic powerhouse with an abundance of all these. The grandeur of the >67th Republic Day parade made me realise that all of us need to get over our narrow religion- and caste-driven politics and instead salute our great workers, farmers and soldiers who have made this achievement possible. We have the strength and the resources to progress even further.V.R. Sastry,BengaluruIndia celebrated its 67th Republic Day with the usual pomp and splendour. While the tableaux showcased the cultural and geographical diversity of this country, what stood out was the Centre’s eagerness to enforce Hindi. None of them had the State name in their respective State language embossed in front. The Prime Minister’s speech was not translated into our various languages, and the greetings by the Prime Minister and various ministries on social media were limited only to Hindi/English. A noticeable thing on social media was how the #NotHindiRepublic hashtag was trending at an all-India level. One hopes that the government takes cognisance of this. Thanks to Hindi-centric policies, a majority of the people in this country experience a strong feeling of “being left out”. The Union government can easily resolve this by amending the Official Languages Act to provide equal status to all languages. Many of us hope we get to see this at least by the 68th Republic Day celebrations.Suhruta Yajaman,Bengaluru
