H. Seema, Assistant Conservator of Forests (Chikkamagaluru subdivision) has filed a complaint with the Chikkamagalur police alleging that M.S. Manik, Deputy Conservator of Forests, abused her in the name of her caste and harassed her by issuing notices.The complaint has been registered by the Chikkamagaluru Town Police under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Atrocities) Act. Ms. Seema has been working as ACF at Chikkamagaluru for the last four months. Since the first day of her reporting for duty, Mr. Manik had been harassing her. “For no reason, the officer issued notices. In the last four months, I have been issued with more than 20 notices," she charged in the complaint.The DCF, according to the complainant, often shouted at her in the office and threatened to suspend her. Besides, the DCF used the name of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to show how influential he was and told the ACF that he could get her transferred or suspended using his clout. Last month, the DCF had reportedly asked a peon to send her out of the chamber. “Many a times, he scolded me taking my caste,” she charged. Mr. Manik was not available for comments.
