The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) State leadership is learnt to have prepared an action plan to step up the activities of the Rashtriya Isai Manch and the Muslim Rashtriya Manch in the State to reach out to the Christian and Muslim communities respectively before the Assembly elections.Sources say the Sangh leadership, which will be spearheading the BJP election campaign, is trying to rope in opinion leaders including historians, legal luminaries, academicians and bureaucrats from both the communities to head the movement. The leadership is understood to have already identified some of them and has held preliminary discussions, in some cases.The idea is to project the manch as a socio-cultural forum of the Sangh to efface the popular notion that the State BJP unit is being headed by hardcore Hindutva proponents, sources say.Though the change of guard in the BJP State leadership was expected to give a fillip to the party’s plans to win over the Nair Service Society (NSS) and different denominations of the Christian community, a dominant section in the party still holds that it did not yield the desired results, maintaining that only estranged sections show an affinity to move closer to the party, the sources said.Building confidenceLaunching the activities of the manch for the two communities is being seen as a confidence-building move to open parleys before the elections. Though a dialogue with the Muslim community is not expected to yield any immediate palpable gain, it would at least help to bring down a general perception of hostility and develop camaraderie that could yield benefits in the future, the sources added. The Isai Manch leaders would be given the responsibility to regularly engage community leaders and also work out an understanding in Central and south Kerala – including in Thiruvananthapuram, where the party hopes to put up an impressive performance in the Assembly elections.
