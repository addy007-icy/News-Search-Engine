The government has now decided to find ways to ensure regular income to the families of farmers who have committed suicide, and to bring them to the mainstream.To begin with, the government wants to bring them under the Pashu Bhagya scheme where dairy cows are given to farmers at subsidised rates, according to Minister of State for Agriculture Krishna Byre Gowda.Mr. Gowda told reporters on the sidelines of a programme organised to release Agri Diary–2016, brought out by the Karnataka Agriculture Graduate Officers’ Association, on Friday that all deputy commissioners had been instructed to give priority to families of farmers, who committed suicide, while selecting beneficiaries for the Pashu Bhagya scheme.He said dairying was one of the best options to ensure assured and regular returns as there was a co-operative mechanism for milk procurement.
