The Opposition complained that they were hardly given enough time to study the proposal being tried for the first time anywhere in the country. Kitco, the consultants who made a presentation on the project, were bombarded with questions by the Opposition.The Kitco officials assured that the Rs.295 crore project would not impose additional burden on the civic body.Opposition leader K.J. Antony alleged that a proposal, which needed in-depth technical scrutiny, is being forced up on the council. Opposition councillor Benedict Fernandez sought to know how the rent for the land had been fixed. He also wanted to know what would be the fate of the project if 300 tonnes of waste were not generated a day. Citing statistics, he claimed that the volume of waste generated in a day would not exceed more than 100 tonnes.Councillors also expressed doubts about the tariff of the energy generated, environmental safety of thermal composting and the corporationâ€™s responsibility in providing the viability fund.In her reply to the debate, Mayor Soumini Jani said that the civic body has received the government order directing to discuss the proposal and get it approved by the council only on January 4 and announced the agenda as passed and adjourned the session amid uproar.
