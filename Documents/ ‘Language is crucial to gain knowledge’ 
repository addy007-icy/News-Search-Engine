Language is crucial to gain knowledge and knowledge is essential for a sustainable society, Prof. Awadesh Kumar Mishra, Director, Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru, said here on Wednesday. He was speaking after inaugurating the 108{+t}{+h}orientation programme organised by UGC-Human Resource Development Centre, University of Mysore, here.Prof. Mishra said that knowledge, which was earlier controlled and found only with a set of individuals, is now being liberated. “The role of education is to shed ego, and to create understanding among people. Language is fundamental for development, including development in science and technology. Language is a God’s gift and it is the only thing that distinguishes man from animal,” he said.Highlighting the importance of the orientation programme, Prof. Mishra called upon teachers to develop their thinking ability and to work with ‘head, heart and hands’ as stated by Mahatma Gandhi. Prof. Lingaraja Gandhi, Director of UGC-Human Resource Development Centre, emphasised on the importance of professional competence. “The new (smart) generation of learners is well-acquainted with technology … this enables them to have quicker access to information. Teaching is not so much about transmitting information, but is about imparting knowledge, values and instilling confidence. Hence, teaching today requires familiarity with education technology,” he said. About 40 teachers from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are participating in the programme.
