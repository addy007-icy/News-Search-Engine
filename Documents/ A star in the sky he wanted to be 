While politicians and sundry stir the already vitiated academic pot in the UoH ever since Rohith’s death, his close friends and classmates are still unable to fathom what made him take the extreme step.What could have been the tipping point for Rohith, considered an “emotionally strong” academic, to kill himself without even discussing his mental turmoil.A look at the research scholar’s timeline for a period of five-and-a-half months since August 1, last indicates that his mind was hyper-active and that he thought about several issues – be it the screening of the film Muzaffarnagar Baaqi Hai , or the death penalty to Yakub Memon. His question on why he should ‘tolerate’ the ABVP – on alleged atrocities since the 1985 Karamchedu incident – he was aggressively-communicative.On his Facebook timeline, he said he had no regret and that he would continue to ‘fight against hegemonic cultural oppression of Hindutva-backed organisations anywhere - in or outside the campus’.Two close friends, who did not wish to be named, recall one of his Facebook posts on the day his suspension was revoked, when Rohith narrates a story about a poor boy telling his grandmother that he was scared of the night and the darkness it brought with it. The grandma replies: “Darkness is not final. The stars you see in the night are not victims. They are immortals. They are martyrs. They still refuse to succumb to darkness…”
