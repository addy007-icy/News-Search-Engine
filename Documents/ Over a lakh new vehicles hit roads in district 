Ernakulam may soon have to devise its own ‘odd-even’ policy going by the burgeoning vehicle population, which has increased by over a lakh last year.Ernakulam Regional Transport Office (RTO) and its five sub RTOs accounted for 83,709 new registrations while Muvattupuzha RTO and its two sub RTOs witnessed registration of 29,443 vehicles taking the combined total for the year to 1,13,152.Unsurprisingly, Ernakulam RTO that registered 29,681 vehicles tops the list. Among its five sub RTOs, North Paravur registered 12,503 vehicles, Tripunithura 12,259, Aluva 11,320, Mattancherry 10,305, and Angamaly 7,641. Muvattupuzha RTO registered 12,587 vehicles while its sub RTOs at Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam registered 11,183 and 5,673 vehicles respectively.Ernakulam and its sub RTOs collectively suspended 3,625 driving licences for drunk driving, and rash and negligent driving. “Strict enforcement has brought down instances of drunk driving,” said K.M. Shaji, Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer, who received the District Collector’s civilian award last year for exemplary service.The six offices collectively issued 19,683 check reports for various violations accounting for compounding fee of Rs.7.23 crore and made a total contribution of Rs.220.68 crore to the State exchequer in 2015.Automated enforcement with the aid of surveillance cameras brought in Rs.85.75 lakh to the coffers, of which Ernakulam RTO alone accounted for Rs.52 lakh.Bus permitsThe year also witnessed the Ernakulam Regional Transport Authority taking a significant decision not to issue new permits to buses older than five years. “It’s a first of its kind move aimed at putting an end to the unhealthy practice of buying near-condemned buses with just a couple of years left in their maximum permitted lifespan of 15 years, thus badly affecting the patronage of public transport,” Mr. Shaji said.
