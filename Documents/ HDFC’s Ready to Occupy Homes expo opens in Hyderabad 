A ‘Ready to Occupy Homes’ exhibition by frontline housing finance company HDFC got underway in Hyderabad on Saturday.As many as 3,500 properties, from apartments to villas, to suit different budgets and requirements have been featured at the 2-day event, at JRC Conventions and Trade Fairs on Narne Road, Raidurgam. On both days, the exhibition will be open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.Member, Executive Management of HDFC, Mathew Joseph, who earlier inaugurated the event, said the exhibition provides customers the option of choosing what he or she sees. The “comfort of seeing”, he explained, is quite important as it addressed the concerns of customers, their hidden fear, related to the timeframe specified about the possession date.“Sometimes it becomes imperative to consider an option of buying a ‘ready to move-in ‘property as they as devoid of risks such as fear of project being delayed, construction not being up to the mark…”, a release issued on the occasion said. Those opting for ready to occupy property, especially those living in a rented accommodation, get to save on the rent.The exhibition is significant from a realty sector’s perspective since it serves as a platform bringing together various developers. It’s a win-win situation for the customers, developers and HDFC with the housing finance company, whose loan book in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, according to Mr.Joseph, is Rs.15,000 crore, looking to generate new business.Hyderabad, he added, is the most sought after destination in the realty space with the products of good quality and the city boasting of well developed infrastructure. Moreover, realty prices in all the comparable south Indian markets are expensive.Stating that the Hyderabad market was a little depressed sometime ago, he said now is the time to buy realty in the city. HDFC has a total of 18 branches in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, including eight in Hyderabad. It plans to take the number in Telangana next month to 11 with the opening of a branch in Karimnagar.
