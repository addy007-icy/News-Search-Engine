Two rebel JD(U) MLCs -- Narendra Singh and Samrat Chaudhary -- were on Wednesday “disqualified” from the Upper House.The Legislative Council chairperson Awadesh Narayan Singh passed the order disqualifying the two for anti-party activities.“Narendra Singh and Samrat Chaudhary, the two JD(U) MLCs, have been found guilty of violation of anti-defection law and disqualified under tenth schedule of the Constitution,” Mr Singh told PTI.The two law-makers with their advocates were present for final hearing on petitions, he said.The Legislative Council chairperson had disqualified another rebel JD(U) MLC Mahachandra Prasad Singh on identical ground last month.Reacting to annulment of his membership of the Council, Samrat Chaudhary kept mum on the merit of the order against him.Mr Singh, who was a minister in the Nitish Kumar government for eight years, was not available for his comments.It may be mentioned that Sanjay Kumar Singh alias Sanjay Gandhi, the JD(U) chief whip in the Legislative Council, had petitioned the chairperson of the Upper House for disqualification of five rebel party MLCs on charge of their involvement in anti-party activities during Assembly polls.While three rebel JD(U) MLCs have been disqualified, Manzar Alam has resigned from the upper House even as the hearing on disqualification petition of Shiv Prasanna Yadav was under way with the rebel MLC undergoing treatment for unspecified illness at a hospital in New Delhi. -- PTI
