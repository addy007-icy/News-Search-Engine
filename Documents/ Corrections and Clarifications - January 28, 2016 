>>A sentence in the Editorial “ >Consolidating ties with France” (January 27, 2016) said that Mr. Hollande marked the fifth visit by a French President as Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade. It should have read “the fifth visit by a French leader”. Earlier Mr. Chirac attended once as Prime Minister and once as President.
