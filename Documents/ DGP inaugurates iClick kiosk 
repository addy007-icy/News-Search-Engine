Andhra Pradesh Director-General of Police J.V. Ramudu on Thursday exhorted the public to feel free to visit the nearest iClick kiosk to lodge complaints online without visiting the police station concerned.“I too was afraid of visiting a police station before joining the police service,” he said while inaugurating an iClick centre at Markapur town in Prakasam district, the 11th in the State.Women could feel free to visit the iClick centre close to the bus stand, he suggested.“Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is very particular on IT innovation in policing, drawing best features from different parts of the world,” said the DGP, who also inaugurated Fingerprint Identification Network System (FINS), a pilot project in the country to ensure online verification of fingerprints of suspects.“Lodging a complaint through iClick is as easy as drawing cash from an ATM,” the DGP said and patted Prakasam Superintendent of Police Ch. Srikanth for creating a record of sorts in the State by disposing of a maximum of 823 of the 851 complaints received from public through the two iClick centres in Ongole in the last six months.South Coastal Zone Inspector General N. Sanjay exhorted banks to come forward to share their ATMs for housing iClick centres.The DGP clicked the mobile app developed by Quadrivium Technologies Limited to verify the fingerprints of the suspects caught under suspicious circumstances on roads at odd times online with the data available at the Command Control Centre (CCC) within seconds.“'We want to minimise human interference to a possible extent to avoid conflicting situation with the public,” he explained, adding based on the success of the pilot project, FINS would be extended to other parts of the State which had a collection of fingerprints of about 7 lakh offenders.E-challan systemThe DGP also introduced ‘E-challan’ system with a breath analyzer in Markapur town. In Ongole city alone 6,600 offenders were penalised through E-challan system for not wearing helmet, he explained.Later, he told reporters that the State police after bifurcation had a shortage of 13,000 police constables. In the first phase 5,000 to 7,000 constables would be recruited shortly and the rest subsequently. “The State police machinery is also not in a position to train 13,000 constables if recruited at one go,” he added. Ahead of Sankaranti, he made it clear that the police would initiate stern action against those who indulge in cock fights.Replying to a question, he said, “there is no restriction on staging peaceful protests.” “But we will have no option but to intervene when the protesters cross their limits,” he said referring to the police suppressing sternly the agitation by Anganwadi workers when they turned violent recently.Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu is very particular on IT use in policing, says the DGP
