Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Varla Devasthanam on Indrakeeladri here was packed with ‘Bhavani’ devotees on Sunday, penultimate day of ‘Bhavani Deeksha Viramana’. Thousands of them from across Andhra Pradesh had darsan of the Goddess after doing ‘Giripradakshina’. The temple administration made elaborate arrangements for the five-day event (‘Bhavani Deeksha Viramana’) that commenced on December 31. A large number of devotees walked all the way to the temple in fulfilment of their wish and invoked the blessings of the presiding deity. The devotees got their ‘Irumudis’ removed by Guru Bhavanis who conferred the ‘Bhavani Deeksha’.Voluntary organizations distributed drinking water packets and buttermilk to the devotees.
