With large volumes of food and kitchen waste compounding the solid waste management programme in cities and expanding municipalities, the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority has finally decided to enforce a forgotten mandate for big builders to provide in-house systems to handle food waste.According to officials of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, from now on any builder who undertakes a project spread over 2.20 lakh square feet area will have to mandatorily provide a decentralised system to convert food waste generated in the building complexes into biogas or compost.“Provision of this facility will be mandatory at such large complexes before the flats are handed over to the owners,” an official told The Hindu.Of late, the Authority has also begun directing builders to include food waste from the local community and small eateries in the neighbourhood for generation of alternative energy or compost.“This will provide the required volume of waste for biogas plants and keep the neighbourhood clean. Residents in apartment complexes will have to segregate waste,” said a source in the Authority.The various environmental bodies are also focussing on handling food waste, since it forms 16 per cent of the municipal solid waste and also leads to formation of landfill gas and leachate (any liquid oozing from garbage is called leachate and is a potential pollutant).It is formed in landfills when water infiltrates and percolates through waste and dissolves organic and inorganic components.
