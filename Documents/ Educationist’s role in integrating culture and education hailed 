Mrs. Y.G. Parthasarathy, dean and director of PSBB Group of Schools, was conferred the ‘Living Legend’ award here on Sunday by PSBB Alumni Association and Rotary Club of Madras T. Nagar.Speaking on the occasion, she said many students of the school have attained great heights now. But what was more important was that art and culture have become part of teaching and children have taken to music and dance very well, she said.“My mother always told me ‘be true to what you do and children will always be grateful to you’,” she said.Dancer Padma Subrahmanyam, who felicitated Mrs. Y.G. Parthasarathy, recollected her decades-long association with the family.She noted that Mrs. Y.G. Parthasarathy was the first person to combine education with culture and that is one of her greatest contributions to society.“I still remember how she completed her doctorate in Vaishnavism at the age of 75. Her husband was in the hospital and she was sitting beside him and writing her thesis to be submitted. She is a very strong woman,” she said.K. Shivakumar and Mohan Rajan of PSBB Alumni Association were among those who spoke at the function.
