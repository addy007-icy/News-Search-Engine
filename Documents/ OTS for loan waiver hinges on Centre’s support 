In what is being seen as a political strategy, the Telangana Government that has initially planned to spare funds from recovery of commercial taxes dues and sale of lands for implementing one time settlement (OTS) of the remainder of crop loan waiver of Rs.8,300 crore is now banking its hopes on the Centre. “With most of the resources planned to be utilised for OTS initially being diverted to GHMC area ahead of the elections, the government appears to have changed its strategy to rely on the Centre for the purpose by pursuing for increase in its borrowing limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, even as less than three months time is left for the completion of the current financial year,” official sources told The Hindu .Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has made no bones of his government’s intentions by making it clear a few days back that they have plans to implement OTS in the next fiscal only if the Centre agrees for raising the FRBM limit from the present 3 per cent of GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) to 3.5 per cent, as recommended by the 14{+t}{+h}Finance Commission based on Telangana’s sound fiscal management in the previous financial year.It is understood that the State Government could mobilise about Rs.4,000 crore additionally if the FRBM limit is increased and in that prospect it would become easy for it to implement the OTS while repaying the third quarter of the loan waiver scheme to bankers in the coming financial year itself. The government was putting into use all tactics to get the FRBM bar raised for it by the Centre as it would also help the ruling party to blame the Centre politically for ignoring its rightful plea, in case its request goes unheeded.Official sources further stated that a proposal from the Agriculture Department has already gone to the State Government seeking allocation of the entire amount required for repaying the remaining half of the crop loan waiver in the coming budget. It has suggested that the step would be one of the measures to infuse confidence, which has dipped further following drought conditions prevailing in the State now, among the farming community.The government is putting into use all tactics to get the FRBM bar raised for it by the Centre
