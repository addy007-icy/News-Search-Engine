Host Karnataka succumbed to its second defeat in the men’s section of the senior National basketball championship, after a 84-73 loss to Delhi, here on Monday.Delhi’s Gopal Ram dominated his smaller opponents to take 33 points and was ably supported by point guard Parvin Davon (22 pts). The two guided their side to its first victory in three outings so far.Karnataka received an early setback when India international Arvind Arumugam took an elbow to the face, in the second-quarter. Arumugam, who required six stitches above his left eye, took no further part in the contest. His teammate Anil Kumar impressed with his athleticism, but a 24-point return was not enough on the day.In another fixture, a pitched battle between Punjab and defending champion Uttarakhand finished with the former emerging a 65-57 winner. Burly centre Gagandeep Singh (16 pts, 13 rebounds) was unstoppable under the ring, while a charged-up Gurvinder Gill also had a good outing, scoring 13 points and grabbing 14 rebounds. The action was physical, yet remained without any malicious intent or untoward incidents.Railway women excelIn the women’s section, an all-round show from Railways helped the powerhouse shut out Tamil Nadu 96-71. The two units were evenly matched until half-time, before Railways broke free.N. Navneetha (19 pts, 14 rebounds), D. Rajapriya (16 pts), Shruthi Menon (13 pts) and Smruthi Radhakrishnan (11 pts) combined well to wreak havoc in the Tamil Nadu defence.
