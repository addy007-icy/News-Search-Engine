Employees of Big Bazaar on Khanapur Road here were in shock when they saw Belagavi City Corporation Commissioner G. Prabhu accompanied by his team of officials and police personnel closing down the supermarket on Wednesday for its failure to pay property tax.Mr. Prabhu initiated punitive action against Big Bazaar as the latter had not paid property tax of around Rs. 19 lakh. He asked all workers to come out of the shopping complex and locked all the entry and exit doors of the supermarket. Caught unawares, the officials of the establishment were quick enough to shell out the entire outstanding tax through a bank cheque for Rs. 19,01,075 to the Commissioner. Thereafter, Big Bazaar resumed its business.Mr. Prabhu had already cautioned property tax payers that action will be taken if they failed to pay dues to the corporation, which was running short of funds to support various development and maintenance works. The corporation could collect only Rs. 15 crore revenue from property tax against an expected Rs. 45 crore during 2014-15. It was expecting to collect Rs. 55 crore during 2015-16 but receipts accounted only for Rs. 29 crore till December 2015.Sources said there were at least 1.18 lakh property in the corporation limits and taxes on these property could come to around Rs. 85 crore. But, the failure of the property owners was causing a major problem and it was affecting development works and maintenance of various other works.The corporation has set up teams for various wards to recover property taxes from defaulters. The teams will visit each defaulterâ€™s premises to recover taxes, the sources added.
