The Special Investigation Team (SIT) police will file a petition in the court seeking week-day custody of former Congress MLA Malladi Vishnu, who was accused No. 9 in the spurious liquor case. The Krishnalanka police, who took up investigation of the case on December 7, arrested nine persons, and SIT arrested Vishnu and Srinivas, taking the total number of arrests to nine in the sensational case during the 34-day investigation.“Though Vishnu was not the licence holder of Swarna Bar and Restaurant in which the incident occurred, he was the main person who was running the bar. The former was the benami and running the liquor business in the names of other family members, including his 78-year old mother,” said city Police Commissioner D. Gautam Sawang who is supervising the investigation of the case.Police are planning to check the income sources, bank accounts, income tax returns, partners and other details of the Congress leader and his brother. “We will invoke Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act against the accused,” said the official.As the accused was not cooperating for investigation and went absconding for 20 days soon after the incident, police are planning to seek permission from the court to grant custodial interrogation of Vishnu and other accused in the case. “The first bail petition was dismissed in the court. If the accused move the bail petition again, SIT will oppose it as the accused may intimidate the witnesses, and still more accused are to be arrested in the case,” said the Commissioner.Statements recordedPolice recorded the statements of many witnesses who revealed that Vishnu threatened the neighbours at the bar over parking and other issues several times.
