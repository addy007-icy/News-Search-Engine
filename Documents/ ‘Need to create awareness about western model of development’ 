Columnist Nagesh Hegde has stressed the need to create awareness among people on the western model of development that has reportedly damaged the ecology.He was speaking at a convention on sustainable living, held as part of ‘Charaka Utsav-2016’ at Shramajeevi Ashram in Honnesara village in Sagar taluk on Sunday.The policy makers have adopted the western model of development that believes in urban-centric economic growth in a blind manner. The commissioning of mega power generation, infrastructure upgrades and industrial projects are being projected as economic growth but the damage they inflict on the ecology is being ignored, he said.He said that Indian villages that were once self-reliant economic units are now witnessing a large scale exodus of people towards urban centres in search of employment. The rapid urbanisation has created new socio-economic problems and has exerted great pressure on the ecology. The quality of air in major urban centres in India is deteriorating and the garbage disposal has become a challenge for the municipal bodies.The rapid industrialisation and urbanisation has also resulted in ecological imbalance, he said.Mr. Hegde stressed on the need to promote native model of development that believes in sustainable and de-centralised economic growth.Addressing the gathering, theatre activist Prasanna said that, the satyagraha launched by him in Badavanalu village in Mysuru district in April 2015 to create awareness among the people on the evils of market-driven economy and to promote sustainable living had evoked good response.It has been planned to organise more number of such campaigns in rural areas in coming days, he added.The programme was organised by Charaka women weavers' cooperative society of Bheemanakone village. As part of the Charaka Utsav, a music concert was held in Bheemanakone village on Saturday in which vocalist Vidyabhushan and troupe performed.
