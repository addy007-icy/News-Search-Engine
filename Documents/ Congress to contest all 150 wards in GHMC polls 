All India Congress Committee general secretary Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday categorically stated that the party would field candidates from all the 150 wards in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).Speaking to presspersons after chairing a Coordination Committee meeting comprising senior leaders, he said the party would firm up the names of those in the fray between January 14 and 16. The Congress manifesto would be released on January 18, adding that it would fight the elections on the plank of development and secularism. Mr. Singh ended his two-day visit to Hyderabad during which he launched the party’s election campaign, on Tuesday, apart from holding back-to-back meetings with aspirants and senior leaders. On Wednesday, among those who attended the Coordination Committee meeting included Leaders of Opposition Mohd. Ali Shabbir (Legislative Council) and K. Jana Reddy (Assembly), apart from Pradesh Congress Committee President N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and Rajya Sabha Member V. Hanumantha Rao.Throwing more light on how the campaign would be this time around, Mr. Singh said that traditional modes of electioneering comprising meetings and rallies apart, the focus would be on door-to-door campaign to lend a personal touch to the candidates’ seriousness in working for the people. Also, he said that in tune with the times and considering that there would be more youth in the fray, social media – primarily Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp – would be leveraged to their full potential.He regretted that the TRS government had tried its best to reduce the number of campaign days, post the announcement regarding reservation of wards.
