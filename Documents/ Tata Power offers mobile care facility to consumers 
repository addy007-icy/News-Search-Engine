Catering to those who are unable to reach customer centres to pay their electricity bills payment owing to the odd-even scheme, discom Tata Power (TPDDL) has introduced a ‘mobile customer care’ facility to provide doorstep services to consumers.Under this initiative, a customer care team of the TPDDL will visit the homes of customers and provide consumer centric services.“The move will drastically reduce customers’ visits to TPDDL offices using their personal vehicles.A few services that would be provided include resolution of general queries related to metering, billing, new connection or supply-related problems, apart from issues related to safety load violation, meter shifting or changing, etc,” said a discom official.The initiative is in line with the ‘digitalisation’ initiative of power utilities under which the discom encourages consumers to opt for E-services.“During the visits by these mobile consumer service vans, which are internet-enabled, consumers will be encouraged to opt for E-billing, track connection details online and contribute to reducing carbon footprints,” added the official.sThese vans will be on the rounds every Saturday in the North and North Western parts of Delhi — the areas where the discom supplies power.“The visits will focus on remote areas. Soon, the service will be extended to industrial and commercial consumer segments,” he said.Commenting on the initiative, Praveer Sinha (CEO and MD, TPDDL) said, “On the customer engagement front, our promise to each consumer is the 3Ds – Develop, Deliver and Delight. The Mobile Customer Care Center is a step in that direction. I am sure it will not only add to the consumer’s convenience, but also empower them to take informed decisions. It will also take TPDDL closer to consumers and cut down on their visits to TPDDL offices using personal vehicles, resulting in reduction of vehicular pollution.”The initiative isin line with the ‘digitalisation’ initiative ofpower utilities
