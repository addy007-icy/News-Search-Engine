Holding the team’s batting failure responsible for the opening T20 loss, Australian batsman David Warner on Wednesday said the hosts need to play smarter cricket against the Indian spinners and take full advantage of the bigger stadiums.Apart from skipper Aaron Finch’s 44, the rest of the Australian batting surrendered meekly against the Indian attack.And Warner, who fell to debutant medium-pacer Jasprit Bumrah (3-23) for 17, says he wants to learn from his mistakes.“During those middle overs a lot of us get carried away trying to play too many big shots and not trying to take advantage of the big fields in Australia. I think in India you can actually get away with trying to hit boundaries because it’s a bit smaller and with either side of the fielders around the bat, you can actually get a more value for your shots,” Warner told reporters here ahead of the second T20 game at the MCG on Friday.“But definitely your basic batting wasn’t there last night [in Adelaide] and that’s trying to get twos on the big field.”Shane Watson (2-24) was the pick of the Australian bowlers in India’s tall score of 188 for three in the first T20 match and Warner welcomed his teammate’s return to the international fold.“Obviously his form over the last 18 months hasn’t been as good as he would like. He knows that; we all know that. We always want him performing to the best of his ability and the one thing I think he’s at strength is his bowling.
