The traffic was allowed a free U turn towards Mehdipatnam.Similarly, traffic coming from Langer Houz towards Mehdipatnam was diverted towards Tolichowki. The motorists were allowed a free U turn near Rumaan Hotel, Tolichowki. Similarly, traffic coming from Tolichowki had to come till Mehdipatnam and take a u turn for going towards Rethi Bowli under pillar no 23.“Motorists were forced to wait for two signal cycles.

We will again study the traffic scenario on Wednesday and then take a call,” Inspector Tolichowki traffic police station, Satish Kumar said.He explained that they need to take into consideration road engineering aspect also as at a few stretches the road conditions are narrow.
