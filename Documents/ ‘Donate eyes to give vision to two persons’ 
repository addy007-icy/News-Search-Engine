At least three million of them can gain eye sight through cornea transplant if only more and more people come forward to donate their eyes after death,” says Dr Bhaskar Rao, whose hospital has been recently upgraded into a multi-specialty hospital to treat patients in the district hitherto moving to Hyderabad or Chennai for treatment and undertake surgeries in Ongole itself under NTR Vaidya Seva.“But we need not lose heart as awareness on eye donation is picking up now,” he adds while talking to The Hindu .
