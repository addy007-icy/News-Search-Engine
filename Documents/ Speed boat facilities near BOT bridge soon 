The Cochin Port Trust is inviting competent parties through a tender to set up water sports and speed boat facilities from the water front along the Fort Kochi-Madura National Highway lying south of the Thoppumpady BOT bridge.The area planned to be developed include the present walkway south of the BOT bridge, which has now fallen into disuse. The port authority had pointed out that it had noticed dumping of waste in the area and would beautify the walkway and adjoining areas for drawing tourists to the place.Port Trust sources said that the successful bidder would be allowed to operate speed boats and water sports activities for tourists. The selected party would also be allowed to operate temporary stalls and sales outlets for snacks and tea/coffee, mobile phone accessories, etc. and to undertake tourism-related activities. K.V. Thomas, MP, said that the initial project was based on a master plan prepared by an architect in the city and envisaged an expenditure of Rs.12 crore. However, a smaller project was initiated later and the present, unused walkway was built. However, it had fallen into disuse and lorry parking is rampant in the area, he said.However, the project is now being revived with the State government pitching in with Rs.50 lakh. Permission has also been sought from the National Highways Authority of India for building new tourist amenities. The present plan is to build a walkway between the BOT bridge and the Alexander Parambithara bridge. It is also planned that a walkway would be built from the old Mattancherry bridge to the BOT bridge. The place will be beautified to attract tourists.Mr. Thomas also said that the DTPC planned to maintain the old Venduruthy bridge and to build facilities for angling since the spot is a frequent haunt of anglers in the city.
