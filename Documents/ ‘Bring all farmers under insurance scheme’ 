State president of the Karnataka Prantha Raita Sangha (KPRS) Maruti Manpade has demanded that the Union government bring all farmers under insurance scheme mandatorily to provide maximum relief to farmers for their losses.Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Mr. Manpade said that the all farmers should be brought under the insurance scheme by setting up an insurance corporation.Expressing displeasure over increasing farmers’ suicide, he said that mounting debts and crop failure were the major reasons.Stating that the Pradhanmantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which will replace the existing National Agriculture Insurance Scheme, would not help farmers, Mr. Manpade said that under NAIS, compensation was calculated based on the loss of yield and by comparing with the average of last five years yield.Of the 1.31 crore farmers covered under the NAIS in the last 13 years, only 49 lakh farmers had benefitted under the scheme, Mr. Manpade said.Mr. Manpade also welcomed the Union government’s decision to increase subsidies for some crops.According to the new scheme, the compensation for crop loss has been increased to Rs. 6,500 per hectare, which was Rs. 4,500 per hectare under the UPA government.
