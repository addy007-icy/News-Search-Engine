Over the last 15 years, butterfly enthusiasts from different parts of the State and neighbouring States congregated in January every year at the Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) here to survey the butterfly species found in the sanctuary including rare ones.The butterfly survey of the Aralam WLS was initiated in 2001 by a team of Malabar Natural History Society (MNHS). Since then the annual survey event continued in every second weekend of January till date. To mark the completion of the 15th year of the survey, the butterfly watchers released a book, Butterfly Diversity of Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, authored by Muhamed Jaffer Palot, V.C. Balakrishnan, Balakrishnan Valappil and G. Harikrishnan Nair. The book was published by the Forest Development Agency of the Forest Department.The book lists the total of 252 species of butterflies recorded over the past 15 years in the WLS. Of the 36 endemic species known from the Western Ghats, 21 species are recorded from the sanctuary. Species such as Nilgiri Clouded Yellow and Nilgiri Tiger are restricted to the high altitude montane Shola grassland ecosystem of Ambalappara.The Malabar Banded Swallowtail and Malabar Banded Peacock were sighted mainly during July-December. The Kanara Oak Blue is an extremely rare species in the State.Dr. Palot said that of the 252 species, 30 species are listed in various schedules of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. He said that important butterfly locations at the WLS are Valayamchal, Pookkundu, Chullikandam, Narikkadavu, Kuruckithode, Pottanplavu, Boothamkallu, Kriackosepalam, Meenmutty falls, Kariankappu, Chavachi, Ambalappara and Paripputhodu.
