With political parties in Tamil Nadu making a vociferous demand for promulgation of ordinance by the Centre for allowing the popular bull-taming sport ‘Jallikattu’, there is a growing clamour for allowing the traditional cockfights in Andhra Pradesh, with some restrictions taking into view the people’s sentiments.Under pressure from animal right activists, the lovers of cockfights in Prakasam district argue that the blanket ban under the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act, 1960, and the Andhra Pradesh Gaming Act, 1974 is unfair.The rural sport should be legalised with some reasonable restrictions as the popular game had been practised in the land of Dravidians for centuries during Sankaranti and temple festivals, they said.Meanwhile, Prakasam police acting tough against the punters, registered 38 cases and bound over 347 persons who had organised cockfights in the past, said Special Branch Deputy Superintendent of Police Rayapatti Srinivas.As many as 162 persons were caught red-handed while organising cockfights in the district and Rs. 1.04 lakh in cash was seized from them along with 40 roosters, the DSP added.A group of cockfight organisers on the city outskirts, on condition of anonymity, pointed out that the stakes involved in Kodipandelu was very less when compared to the Godavari districts.The organisers say that naked heel sport should be allowed and the best of the roosters in a series of bouts should be declared winner to kindle interest in preserving and promoting the poultry wealth of the State.In the past, the losers used to arrange for feast for the entire village during the big festival, they recalled, adding that instances were there when the rulers allowed the winning cock owner to collect taxes for some period before another person whose cock wins the fight.The sport has been a popular pastime from the ages and the same should not be forbidden, they added.Growing clamour for allowing cockfightsin view of the vociferous demandto permit Jallikattuin Tamil NaduPolice have registered 38 cases and bound over 347 persons who were involved with the cockfightsin the past162 persons caughtred-handed in Prakasam district so far, with seizure ofRs. 1.04 lakh, along with 40 roosters
