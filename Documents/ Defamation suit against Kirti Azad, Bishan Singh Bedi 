The father of a cricketer has filed a defamation case against BJP MP Kirti Azad, former spinner Bishan Singh Bedi and two others in response to allegations that an exchange of Rs. 25 lakh was made to get his son selected for a team.Taking cognisance of the suit, Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain has posted the matter on February 22 for pre-summoning evidence.Plaintiff Tejbir Singh alleged that the four respondents — including erstwhile batsman Surinder Khanna and Sameer Bahadur — levelled the allegations against his son at a press conference held last month while talking about the DDCA controversy.“They have intentionally and with mala fide imputed that the complainant’s son has been wrongly selected for one of the important tournaments and that there has been an exchange of Rs.25,00,000 for such selection,” the complainant said.“Such explicit false imputation has been made with specific intention to defame the complainant and his son and with intent to lowering their reputation and esteem in the eyes of public at large and among their friends, colleagues and family members and also to take advantage of such false statements while handling the above stated political controversy in an unlawful manner,” it was added.The complainant has urged the court to punish the respondents according to the law.
