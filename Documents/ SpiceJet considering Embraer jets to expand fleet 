SpiceJet, which has activated plans to place orders for new planes to expand its fleet strength, is considering Embraer jets for its fleet, among others.The Brazilian aircraft-maker had late last year given a presentation on its aircraft to the SpiceJet management, which is exploring all options before taking a final call on the purchase order, top airline sources said here, adding at present, “all options are on the table”.If the budget carrier opts for Embraers along with other types of aircraft, it will become the second domestic carrier to have such planes, after regional airline Air Costa.The now-defunct Paramount Airways also had an all-Embraer fleet when it was operational.SpiceJet has a total of 41 aircraft in its fleet comprising 25 Boeing 737s, 14 Bombardier Q400s and two leased A320 family Airbus planes.“SpiceJet is evaluating all option before placing order for new aircraft. As part of this exercise, an Embraer team has also given its presentation,” the sources said.The Gurgaon-based airline has not yet decided about the type or types of new aircraft it will buy or the number of planes, the sources said.When contacted, a SpiceJet spokesperson said that the airline is talking to multiple aircraft makers but refused to share details. — PTI
