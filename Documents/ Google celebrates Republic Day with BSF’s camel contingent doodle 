Google on Tuesday celebrated India’s Republic Day with a doodle of a tableau of camels carrying band members. Each of the six camels carries a letter of the word ’Google’ on its golden caparison. The BSF camel contingent is the inheritor of the heritage of the Bikaner Royal Camel Force, known as ‘Ganga Risala’, and is based in the border town of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan.The 90-camel contingent became part of this celebration in 1976 after it replaced a similar squad of the Army which had been participating in the Republic Day parade since it first took place in 1950.Every year it travels to Delhi in November to participate in the Raising Day event of the BSF on December 1 and the Republic Day parade after which it retreats to its base.Google had marked the 65th Republic Day with a doodle featuring ‘Jaanbaaz’, BSF’s motorcycle daredevils who delight the crowd at Rajpath every January 26, in their famous pyramidal formation.
