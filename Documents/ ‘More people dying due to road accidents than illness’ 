Traffic rules are meant for public safety and anybody violating them would only be endangering their lives, said city Police Commissioner G. Sudheer Babu.Taking part at the 27th National Road Safety Week celebrations here on Thursday, the Commissioner addressed a large number of students of Chaitanya Colleges who took part in the traffic awareness rally. Mr Sudheer Babu pointed out that more people were dying in road accidents than due to illness in the country.He urged the youth not to cross the speed limit and end their lives. “Your parents only provide you a facility by buying you two-wheelers. Use it for the correct purpose than using to meet bad fate,” he said, adding that by observing traffic rules one could save his or her life.ACP (Traffic) Ch. Venkateswar Rao urged the students not to seek pleasure in violating the rules. If the youth could restrain from going at high speeds, most of the road accidents could be prevented. “The traffic rules are for our own good. If we violate them, they not only harm us but others as well,” he pointed out.Chaitanya Colleges secretary Ch. Purushottam Reddy lauded the traffic police for organising the awareness programme and wanted the students to inculcate sense, discipline and sense of belongingness. “The traffic police are there for us and we should listen to them,” he said. Inspectors Venkatesh and Babu Rao, and SIs Hatihram, Dattadri, Madhu, Prabhakar Reddy, Vijaychander Rao and Purnachander Rao, among others, were present.
