The much-awaited and hyped 150{+t}{+h}film of megastar-turned-Rajya Sabha member K. Chiranjeevi has run into serious issues. His son Ramcharan Tej has already announced that he would produce his father’s landmark film, a remake of Tamil hit ‘Kathi’ and that it would be directed by V.V. Vinayak, with dialogues to be penned by Paruchuri brothers.‘Kathi’ had Tamil superstar Vijay as hero and was helmed by A.R. Murugadoss. It was a hit last year but from the very next day of its release on the Tamil screens, a Telugu film director Narasimha Rao has been crying himself hoarse that “80 per cent of the scenes of ‘Kathi’ were part of an original story” that he claimed to be his, slamming charges of plagiarism against Mr. Murugadoss.Mr. Narasimha Rao has been associated with the Tamil director of ‘Robot’ fame, Shankar, for some time in Kollywood and it was during that time that he said he had narrated his script to actor Vijay. However, it soon was shelved for various reasons. Later, he alleged that Mr. Murugadoss had taken his script and made ‘Kathi’ with Mr. Vijay, which went on to become a success.And when Ramcharan announced that the 150th film of his father that he would produce was a Telugu remake of ‘Kathi’, Mr. Narasimha Rao took the matter to the notice of the United Forum of Telugu Film Directors, of which former Union Minister and popular director Dasari Narayana Rao is Chairman.The Forum had promptly shot off a letter to the Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce demanding that Mr. Murugadoss be ‘ostracised for plagiarism’ as far as the Telugu industry was concerned. The issue also became a hot topic on the social media.Whether the development can affect Mr. Chirjanjeevi’s movie is not yet known but what has made eyebrows rise is that the megastar has not been on the best of terms with Mr. Dasari Narayana Rao in recent times and this could set off another war of words between both camps. There was no response from the Film Chamber till late in the night.
