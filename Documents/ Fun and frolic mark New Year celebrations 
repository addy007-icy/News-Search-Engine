Revellers in different age groups bid adieu to 2015 and welcomed 2016 amid fun and frolic here on Thursday night.While many people hosted New Year parties at their houses and estates, hotels added flavour to the celebrations by organising programmes suiting the needs of different classes of people. The events organised by hotels witnessed a large turnout of students and young people. Mesmerising dance and music programmes and delicious food added colour to the programmes.At the stroke of the midnight hour, revellers cheered, burst crackers and greeted one another. The celebrations in most places went on till 1 a.m. A good number of youth roamed around the city on motorcycles, wishing all those they came across a happy New Year.In Dharwad, cultural and musical events were held in several localities.However, the celebrations were relatively free from pomp and were limited to households.The police had made elaborate security arrangements to prevent untoward incidents. Additional troops of the District Armed Forces were deployed at specified locations.Interestingly, activists of the Sri Rama Sene who used to oppose such events remained silent this time.
