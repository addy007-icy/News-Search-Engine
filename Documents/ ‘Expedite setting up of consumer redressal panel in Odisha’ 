The Ganjam District Consumer Bar Association (GDCBA) on Thursday requested Odisha Governor S. C. Jamir to initiate the process of setting up of the proposed Circuit Bench of the Odisha State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission (SCDRC) in Berhampur.Although the State government on January 13, 2014, had decided to establish this Circuit Bench for consumers of south Odisha districts as well as in Sambalpur for Western Odisha and had also agreed to provide necessary infrastructure for its functioning, till now nothing has been done in this direction so far.A four-member delegation of the GDCBA, comprising its president Kailash Chandra Mishra, vice-president Sriharsha Prasad Das, senior members Nilamadhav Mohapatra and Satish Panigrahy, met Mr. Jamir in Bhubaneswar to apprise him about the situation. Speaking to The Hindu , members of the delegation said he promised to look into the matter. “He promised to take up the matter with the Chief Minister and chief secretary,” said Mr Panigrahy.The GDCBA has approached the government and the administration several times on the same issue. It had ceased work from August 1, 2014, to October 14, 2015, hampering the functioning of the Ganjam District Consumer Redressal Forum (DCDRF). The GDCBA had called off their strike following an assurance promise by the government.The decision to establish two Circuit Benches was taken considering the large number of cases pending before the State Commission from southern and western parts.
