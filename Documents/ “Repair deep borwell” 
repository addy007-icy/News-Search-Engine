Appealing to Collector M. Karunakaran to instruct officials to repair the out-of-service borewell in their hamlet, a group of villagers from Paththinipaarai near Moontradaippu in the district submitted a petition to him on Monday.The petitioners said their village, housing 200 dwellings, was relying upon the deep borewell sunk a couple years ago for drinking water. When the source of drinking water went out of service, the villagers were desperately searching for alternative source for getting drinking water for the past two months, but in vain.“Though we’ve submitted a good number petitions to the officials over the past two months, no step was taken to bring the deep borewell back to service,” the petitioners said.
