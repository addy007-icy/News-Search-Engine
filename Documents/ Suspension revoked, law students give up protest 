Six students of Government Law College here, who were on a hunger strike since Wednesday, gave up their protest on Thursday after the college administration revoked their suspension.The students were allegedly suspended for taking part in the protest at the Madras High Court in September 2015 along with a section of lawyers demanding that Tamil be made a court language.They started the hunger strike on Wednesday alleging that the administration had unfairly suspended them for participating in peaceful protests for what they termed a legitimate demand of making Tamil a court language.During their strike on Wednesday, four students were detained by the police and released at night.Meanwhile, on Thursday morning, various students’ associations, including Students’ Federation of India, Revolutionary Student Federation, All India Students’ Association, All India Students’ Federation and Tamil Nadu Students’ Movement, issued a joint statement expressing solidarity with the protesting law college students.The students gave up their protest in the afternoon after the college administration informed that their suspension had been revoked.
