The city and rest of the State have shrugged off the cold wave that gripped it during much of last week.Temperatures over the last three days steadily climbed due to south-easterly winds from over the Bay of Bengal that brought in moisture and warmth.While the warmth was welcomed by denizens, it redefined New Year celebrations.“For most people it must have been the first New Year celebration in recent years when they posed for pictures without sweaters,” said C. Nimisha Patel, who along with her friends had gathered at an eatery on Necklace Road to usher the New Year.On Saturday, the city recorded a maximum of 33 degree Celsius, up by about four degrees from a week ago.Scientists at the Indian Meteorological Centre in Begumpet said that the wind pattern changes can be attributed to anti-cyclonic circulation over the bay.Last week, minimum temperatures dipped below 20 degree Celsius in Hyderabad even as it touched 4 degree Celsius in Adilabad. Until December 21, 2015, easterly winds dominated to give an impression that winter onset was delayed.“The northern winds are responsible for the chills while the wind from the Bay is warm. When one trumps the other, their respective effects are felt. These changes are usual,” said meteorologist Narasimha Rao, adding that the warmth would last until the circulation is over the bay. The northern winds also lack moisture and are responsible for dry air.The Met department has predicted that both maximum and minimum temperatures will start dipping again in a few days even as fog would engulf the city during early hours. However, the maximum temperature will continue to remain above the 30-year normal, indicating that the days could be warm, while nights could cool.
