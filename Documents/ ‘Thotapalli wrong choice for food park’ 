A day after the government issued a GO allotting 460 acres for the proposed mega food park at Thotapalli village in Agiripalli mandal, the Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (APCCIF) faulted the choice of the land for the project owing to two reasons.The first one is the land is not suitable for establishment of industries due to its rough terrain and secondly levelling it and creating basic infrastructure entailed huge expenditure and was time consuming.The government should look for a more suitable location for the project that was sanctioned for Krishna district way back in February last, said APCCIF president – elect M. Murali Krishna.Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Murali Krishna said the government had promptly framed the Food Processing Policy in July last year and the rules thereof a few months later, but it did not pay heed to the suggestions that the chosen parcel of land was not suitable for development of any industry. There are good places like Mallavalli (Bapulapadu mandal) and Veerapanenigudem (Gannavaram) but they were ignored, he said, contending that levelling of the land and creation of plug-and-play infrastructure by the master developer would take not less than two years.More precious time was bound to be lost in getting prospective entrepreneurs to actually set up their units. In the course of time, investors would scout for better alternatives avenues, he observed.APCCIF Executive Director P. Bhaskar Rao said substantial value addition was being made to the bountiful production (6 lakh tonnes) of mangoes at Srini Food Park in Chittoor district by about 60 processing units.The production of mangoes in Krishna district was marginally low at 5.6 lakh tonnes, but zero value addition was done due to the lack of proper facilities.A lot of hopes were pinned on the proposed mega food park but the wrong choice of land was affecting its prospects, he claimed.Land allotted for the project is notsuitable owing to its rough terrainCreating basic infra on such land will entail huge expenditure and it’s time consuming
