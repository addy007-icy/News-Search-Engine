Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy opined that university students protesting for more than one day should be thrown out as it was a place for learning.In reply to a question on the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a research scholar of Hyderabad University, Mr. Swamy said it was a tragedy but his suicide note did not mention anything of suspension. “I am a professor and a university is a place to read and hold opinions. You can protest but only for a day and cannot go on bunking classes and preventing others from attending classes,” he said. They should learn politics but have party affiliations only after they leave the university, Mr. Swamy added.
