Demolition of a century-old structure built by the then princely State of Cochin to house its various offices in Thrissur began here on Saturday to make way for a spacious employability centre. Two-thirds of the building has been razed down, and only the portion housing the District Employment Exchange remains.The demolition drive was undertaken to build a multistoreyed complex in which an employability centre with various facilities for job seekers will come up. However, civil society groups rue that the demolition work was undertaken without following the proper procedure.In the case of buildings that are more than a century old, demolition must be undertaken only after obtaining permission of the State Archaeological Department. The Town Planning Department had not sought such permission, they alleged.The earlier plan was to build a new structure without damaging the existing building, which remained stable. The foundation stone for the new building will be laid on February 1 in the presence of Labour Minister Shibu Baby John. Though the building had housed many offices in the past, over the past several years it was used by the District Employment Exchange.
