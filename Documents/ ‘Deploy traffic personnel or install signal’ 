Residents and commuters want a traffic signal to be installed at the intersection of Sholinganallur-Medavakkam Main Road and the First Main Road and Prabhu Nagar Road, Perumbakkam. If a traffic signal is not installed, traffic police personnel should at least be deployed, they say.The crossroads are marked by heavy vehicular traffic throughout the day. During rush hour, the intersections witness traffic bottlenecks, hindering free movement of vehicles. It is common to see vehicles lined up for more than 500 metres on the arterial stretch, including First Main Road and Prabhu Nagar Road, connecting Medavakkam and Rajiv Gandhi Salai.The intersection is a private bus pick-up/drop point for the staff of various companies and this affects traffic movement to a great extent.“Reaching Velachery Main Road and Rajiv Gandhi Salai taking the stretch is an ordeal. Though the afternoon witnesses free flow of traffic, it comes to a grinding halt near the intersection as the road here is in a sorry state.Vehicle users, mostly motorcyclists, swerve to the left and to the right in order to avoid the potholes and a huge crater, unmindful of the consequences. A few even sneak through the small gap between heavy vehicles or come in the wrong direction,” J. Manoharan, a motorist, said.Several vehicle users indulge in reckless driving, and don’t bother to stop at the intersection. Pedestrians find it difficult to negotiate the crossroads and feel that there is no respite from continuous honking.“Company vehicles, water tankers and heavy trucks pass through the intersection,” Manoharan adds.Pedestrians and motorists said that the traffic chaos at the two intersections could be controlled either by installing traffic signals or by deploying traffic police personnel, at least during rush hour.
