She is all set to add a touch of glamour to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls. Film actor and popular Telugu TV host Jeevitha will be actively engaged in the campaign on behalf of the BJP over the next six days.Engaged in drafting her campaign schedule at the party office, Jeevitha said she will hit the campaign trail on Tuesday and continue till the last day of the campaign on Sunday. “The detailed schedule of where to address meetings and where to canvass is being worked out,” she informed.But do glamorous and celebrity campaigners fetch votes? In her usual candid manner she said, “Film stars are useful in getting crowds for meetings, but can they get votes, is a big question. I think it is a myth that the large crowds that throng for our campaign get converted into votes.”On the day of polling, glamour stuck crowds need not actually feel swayed by the stars from the celluloid, unless a certain bond of faith is established, she opined.Jeevitha said she was highly impressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his commitment for the nation, and joined the BJP much before the Parliamentary elections. “I am fascinated by his drive and his concepts,” she quipped.Does her film star husband, Rajasekhar, have political plans? “No. He is an outspoken person and says what he has to say. He feels not being affiliated to any party allows him to be candid in voicing his opinions,” Jeevitha said.
