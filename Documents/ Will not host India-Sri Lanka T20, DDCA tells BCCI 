Snubbed by the Delhi High Court, Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) today officially intimated the BCCI that it will not be able to host the second India-Sri Lanka Twenty20 International scheduled to be held on February 12.The match is all set to be moved to another venue with Ranchi being the favourite.After the Delhi High Court refused to direct the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to provide them with Provisional Occupancy Certificate (POC), there was little chance for the controversial faction-ridden association to host the slated match.“We have informed the BCCI today that we will not be able to get the clearance from MCD in time after complying to norms. We told the BCCI officials that we will have all the compliance certificates ready for World T20, but it will not be possible to get clearance before February 12 and then get clearances from state’s fire and electrical department,” DDCA working president Chetan Chauhan, told.Asked if the High Court observation turned out to be an embarrassment for the association which is neck-deep in financial scandals, Mr. Chauhan said “We had to take a chance and that is why we moved High Court. Had we not done that, we would have been criticised for letting the match go.”“At least we tried to organise but in such short time, we would not be able to complete the required 60-point deviations that the MCD has cited. But rest assured we will be ready for the World Cup,” he said.He also denied knowledge of DDCA official Manjeet Singh misinforming secretary Anurag Thakur about having all the compliance certificates.“I know he (Manjeet) said DDCA is ready but I do not think he mentioned about having the compliance certificates. If he has said so and it is there in the BCCI minutes of the meeting, we will surely pull him up,” he said.
