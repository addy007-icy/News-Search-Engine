Surgeons from Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, conducted a heart surgery on a 63-year-old doctor Vishwanath Jadav from Udgir, Maharashtra by using an Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenator or ECMO that works like a heart and lung machine, a statement said.Angiograms revealed that the doctor had critical (95 to 99 per cent) blocks in the left main artery and right coronary artery.“Due to his poor heart function, surgery or any form of intervention would have been extremely risky with a high probability of on-table mortality. At this juncture, the team of cardiologists at the hospital took the decision to perform ECMO-assisted angioplasty,” the doctors said.Surgeons said that the patient was connected to ECMO without opening up or anaesthesia while angioplasty with three stent placements for both left and right sided blocks was rapidly accomplished.The ECMO ensured that the patient tolerated the procedure without any major hiccup.
