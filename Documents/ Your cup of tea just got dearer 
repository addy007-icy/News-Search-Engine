Now, you will have to dig deeper into your pocket to enjoy a cuppa tea at a roadside tea stall or a restaurant.Within days of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) hiking the price of milk by Rs. 4 a litre, people have to pay up to Rs. 4 more now.After KMF increased the price of milk — the popular toned milk now costs Rs. 33 against the earlier Rs. 29 — many roadside tea stall vendors have been forced to raise the price of tea and coffee by Rs. 1 or Rs. 2.The hike in price is, however, more steep in middle class restaurants.Costly commoditiesRanganath, owner of a provision store, who came to the law courts on Tuesday, prefers to have tea at a roadside stall. “A cup of tea, which used to cost Rs. 8 in a middle class hotel or restaurant, now costs Rs. 10,” he said.The hike at the roadside stall is more reasonable. Raju, who runs a stall near Mysuru Zilla Panchayat office, said he was forced to increase the price of a cuppa from Rs. 6 to Rs. 7.“Not just milk, even sugar has become dearer now,” he lamented. He sells about 150 cups of tea or coffee per day.But, a few hotels like Preethi Sagar in Shivarampet have not increased the rates.“We do not want to lose customers by increasing the price. We stand to lose by allowing the milk and labour costs to go in waste if customers do not come,” he reasoned.Awaiting BudgetPresident of Mysuru Hotel Owners Association, Narayan Gowda, told The Hindu that most roadside tea stalls had increased the price by Rs. 1 or Rs. 2 for a cup, and hotels Rs. 2 to Rs. 4 per cup.“Bigger hotels have not increased the price for now. They are waiting for the Budget to see if there is change in taxes or price of commodities,” Mr Gowda said.
