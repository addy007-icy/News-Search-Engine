Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said that the judgment of the High Court will be honoured and elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation conducted in 21 days from the date of issue of notification as ordered by the court.Reacting to the verdict, Mr. Rao stated in a release that the government decided to prune the election schedule to introduce electoral reforms with a view to eliminate a couple of problems faced by it and also the people.One of them was the deployment of one lakh government employees on election work for a month which will inconvenience administration beside crippling developmental programmes. The one lakh employees constituted a third of the work force of the government.The density of population in Hyderabad was huge and, if the election schedule was long drawn, it will expose public to hardship, he added.
