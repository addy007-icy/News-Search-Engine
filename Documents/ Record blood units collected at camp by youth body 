Improving its own record, a youth organisation in the city on Saturday collected over 3,000 units of blood in a single camp.While nearly 5,000 volunteers turned up, the blood banks managed to collect 3,062 units of blood, requesting the others to donate during summer days when the banks face acute shortages.The blood donation camp was organised by the Cuttack Nagar Yuvak Sangha in association with the Metaphor Trans Corporation Pvt. Ltd. at the Windsor Place here in Markat Nagar.Around the same time last year, the organisation had collected 1,239 units of blood, informed Sangha member Ranjita Biswal.Besides the Central Red Cross and SCB hospital blood banks here, other blood banks from Dhenkanal, Bhubaneswar, Talcher, Bhadrak, Puri, Jajpur and Angul took the units for their respective hospitals. Looking at the requirement of thalassemia patients in the State, the youth organisation is planning to organise more such camps during the summer days during which the blood availability is less. “We are planning to adopt some thalassemia patients in near future to meet their annual blood requirements,” said Metaphor director Sushil Kumar Dhalasamanta.“Odisha requires around four lakh units of blood every year to cater to the patients,” informed a staff of the central Red Cross blood bank here, adding that half of this requirement is now being met by donation and the rest through exchange of blood.
