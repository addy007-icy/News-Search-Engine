Land acquisition problems continue to thwart a new project for water supply augmentation with a water treatment plant at Kalamassery.The plant envisaged with producing 185 million litres of water a day, for which the government had even provided administrative sanction for Rs. 256.53 crore, continues to remain a non-starter even though the government had earmarked Rs. 358 crores for the new plant in the 2014 budget.Though senior officials in Kerala Water Authority say that the government has sorted out the land issue where KINFRA would provide six acres to set up the plant, nothing has been inked to take the project ahead. Earlier, land was sought from HMT, but it failed to come through.The first phase of the project would include setting up of a plant with 135 mld capacity at an investment of Rs. 56 crore. For bringing water to the plant, raw water well has to be set up in the Periyar at Aluva. The new plant is expected toimprove the supply to areas like Mulavukkad, Eloor, Cheranelloor and Vypeen where the supply is not able to meet the demand as these areas are at the farther end of the supply lines.It will take at least 18 months to set up the planr along with the electro-mechanical works including sub-station works.
