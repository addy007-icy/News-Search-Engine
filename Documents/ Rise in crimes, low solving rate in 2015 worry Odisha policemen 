The capital city of Bhubaneswar witnessed a rise in cases of robbery, dacoity and theft in 2015 compared to the previous year.After the annual review of crimes recorded in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, Commissioner of Police R. P. Sharma said the number of robberies shot up to 156 in 2015 from 123 in 2014. In previous years (2011, 2012 and 2014), this number had never crossed 100.The city police have also failed to sustain the rate of success in cracking robbery cases in 2015, 66.6 per cent compared to 72.3 per cent in 2014. Value of property stolen in robberies in 2015, however, was assessed to be lower than that of 2014. The capital city has witnessed 34 robberies on National Highways compared to six committed in Cuttack.There has also been sudden increase in theft cases in Bhubaneswar. According to Mr. Sharma, 1,788 theft cases were reported in 2015 as against 1,432 in the 2014. The value of property stolen was Rs.10.75 crore in 2015 (Rs.5.42 crore in 2014). The city police have also failed to match the success rate in property recovery. In 2015, 50.3 per cent of stolen property was recovered as compared to 60.7 per cent in the previous year.Two-wheeler owners had a harrowing time in Bhubaneswar as 760 two-wheelers were lifted from different localities in 2015 while at the same time 200 such vehicles were stolen from Cuttack.In case of dacoity, 13 such cases were reported in Bhubaneswar in 2015 compared to 12 in 2014. There has also been marginal rise in murder cases which rose from 42 to 44 between 2014 and 2015.With regards to crime against women, 129 rape cases were reported from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Incidentally, in 90 cases, victims were minors. The police commissioner said: “As high as 80 per cent of rape cases are associated with love affair leading to elopement. So involvement of minor girls is apparently reflected in cases of rape.”Mr. Sharma, who would relinquish the post of commissioner and soon join as the vigilance director upon his promotion, expressed satisfaction on law enforcement and crime detection during his two-and-a-half years’ tenure.960 two-wheeler were lifted from different localities in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack
