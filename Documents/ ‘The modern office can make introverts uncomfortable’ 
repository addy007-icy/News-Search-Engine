Modern office features such as hot-desking or desk-sharing and open-plan floors appeal mainly to extrovert workers with others finding them uncomfortable, according to a new study.Personality has a big impact on the type of office environment people prefer to work in, researchers said.“Despite changes in technology many people still work in an office. Understanding how personality interacts with the office environment is key to improving job satisfaction and productivity,” said John Hackston, Head of Research at business psychologists OPP in the United Kingdom, who conducted the study.Over 300 people – 71 per cent of them female and an average age of 47 years – completed an online survey about their current office environments.The results showed that many features of the modern office were much more likely to be preferred by extroverts than by introverts.Extroverts were significantly happier at work and had higher levels of job satisfaction. Some features were desired by almost everyone, such as having your own desk and working area, having well-designed workplaces and having ‘quiet areas’ available. Others, such as desk-sharing or hot-desking, were disliked by most people.However, there are some simple changes that can be made to improve staff satisfaction and increase productivity.“These include allowing the staff more storage for personal items when hot-desking; creating smaller neighbourhoods within open-plan offices; not overdoing clear desk policies as clearing away all personal items can be demotivating to some people and providing quiet zones for people to work in when needed,” he added. The finding was presented at the British Psychological Society Division of Occupational Psychology’s annual conference in Nottingham.
