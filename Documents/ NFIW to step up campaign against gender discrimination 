The National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) would step up campaign against discrimination in all forms and continue its fight to achieve gender equality, general secretary NFIW Annie Raja said.Addressing the media here on Sunday on the just concluded 20{+t}{+h}National Congress of the NFIW, she said over 1,000 delegates participated in the deliberations spread over three days on the theme ‘Denial of Rights and Justice to Women is Violence’.Five major issues — Communalism and Fundamentalism, the Politics and Economics of Caste Violence, the Right to Education and Women, the Revolutionary Potential of Women in Agriculture and Women and Employment — were taken up at the national meet.She noted with concern the rising cases of witch-hunting in the country, even in South India, and demanded that the government draw up a law across the States to curb the evil practice.“Women are being exploited under the garb of religion and personal laws,” Ms Annie Raja said reiterating their demand for a Uniform Civil Code. In many parts of North India the clergy have passed decree against ration cards since the law dictates that the Food Security Cards be issued only in the name of the woman of the family, she said elaborating on how religion had become an excuse to continue gender bias.The NFIW has decided to take up a nation-wide consultancy on the subject and draw up a draft law and submit it to the government.The national congress passed resolutions demanding that the government take steps to stop honour killing, National secretary Nisha Siddhu said.Aruna Roy was elected president and Annie Raja general secretary along with 131 member new leadership of the NFIW.
