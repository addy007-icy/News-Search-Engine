Minister for Fisheries and Ports K. Babu has hailed CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that his party will not oppose the Vizhinjam seaport project or attempt to change the project agreement with the Adani group. A pressnote quoting the Minister said it was heartening that the CPI(M) had, though belatedly, acknowledged the potential of the project to bring benefits for the State. “The strong popular support for the government’s determination to make the project a reality has forced the Opposition to drop its resistance,” it said.— Special Correspondent
