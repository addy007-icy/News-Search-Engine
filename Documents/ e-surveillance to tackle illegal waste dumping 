With increased instances of waste dumping on the streets, civic authorities of Kochi are planning a crackdown on offenders.The authorities are planning to introduce electronic surveillance. The local body will soon come up with a surveillance system, which will be mounted on street lamp posts to keep tabs on offenders.The local body has fined a few prominent residents of the city after their vehicles were caught bringing domestic refuse. The tendency to throw waste packed in carry bags and plastic covers is on the rise. This has led to piling up of waste on roads at points other than the designated collection centres. “The trend has attained alarming proportions in some parts of the city, especially in Kaloor and Edappally areas,” said V.K. Minimol, chairperson of the Health Standing Committee of the Kochi Corporation.A number of such incidents were reported from Vyloppilli Road near Kaloor and BTS Road near Edappally. After a couple of people dump waste at a spot, heaps of garbage reach the area within no time. People come in cars and two-wheelers to dump waste.
