The Rashtriya Lok Dal, joined by farmers, staged a protest at the Collectorate here on Wednesday demanding the government pressurise the sugar mill owners to pay the cane growers remuneration in one go.The RLD’s western UP in-charge Rajkumar Sangwan warned that they would block roads and railways if the government fails to meet their demands. The protesters came in a procession and thronged the Collectorate, where extra police force was deployed.If the government is not raising the sugarcane prices under pressure from the mill owners, they should at least ensure that farmers are paid their due amount at the rate of Rs 280 a quintal in one go, Mr Sangwan said.They also submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Chief Minister, to the district administration.Addressing the gathering, Mr Sangwan accused the Central and the State governments of “joining hands” with the mill owners to “destroy” farmers.The Central government has been giving loan to mill owners at zero interest rate. The State government is also giving them rebates. But nobody cares as to how the farmers will repay their loan, he alleged.He also alleged that the Central and the State governments were “conspiring” to implement the Rangarajan Committee’s recommendations.It will be fiercely opposed, he said. -- PTI
