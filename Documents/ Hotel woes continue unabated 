Five years after its lease expired, Tata-owned Indian Hotels Company Limited (IHCL) may get some more time before it has to give up the iconic Taj Mansingh hotel.The New Delhi Municipal Council, which has already given nine extensions to IHCL since the lease expired in 2011, is still completing paperwork for the hotel’s auction. The last extension given in November will expire on January 31.NDMC chairperson Naresh Kumar said: “We are completing documentation for the auction. It is an iconic hotel and has been with the IHCL for 33 years, so we are being very thorough.”Mr. Kumar said the NDMC was assessing the assets of the hotel. He said that a meeting of the Council would be held soon to decide on the auction, but refused to comment if IHCL would get another extension. Meanwhile, the NDMC’s dispute with Le Meridien hotel over licence fee continues. The matter is in court, said Mr. Kumar.
