A birth defect that occurs in just one of 50,000 live births was a matter of great discomfort, untold embarrassment and pain for 31-year-old him Ajnesh Kumar.An exstrophy bladder ( Ectopia vesicae) made life extremely difficult for him. Since the bladder was not formed completely, leaking urine from the exposed surface of the organ would wet his clothes all the time.“Ajnesh kept a cloth wrapped around his private parts to wipe and clean the urine. This became a very serious social problem and hygiene issue for him. What made the situation worse was the fact that he was repeatedly turned away by different hospitals,” explained Dr. Anant Kumar, the director of urology and kidney transplant at Max Super Specialty Hospital in Saket, who finally corrected the problem.Ajnesh underwent a 12-hour surgery in mid-December. His small contracted bladder was removed and an artificial bladder constructed. After seeing his struggle to live with dignity for the past three decades, the people of his village contributed to cover his surgery costs.
