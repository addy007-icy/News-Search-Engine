The Kochi City police have registered a fresh case against Thadiyantavide Nazeer, a suspected Indian Mujahideen operative and his close aide Shahanas P.A. on charges of seeking to raise funds from abroad to finance terrorist activities.According to the police, the case was registered by the Ernakulam Central police on the basis of emails sent by Nazeer through Shahanas to a person residing in an undisclosed location abroad.“Despite being in jail, Nazeer had sent emails to people staying abroad and some of these discussed matters that pose serious threat to the security of the nation,” confirmed S.T. Suresh Kumar, Assistant Commissioner of Police. The official, however, refused to disclose the specifics by saying that it would affect the progress of the investigation.Meanwhile, official sources said one of the emails had received a positive reply with regard to raising money and the police are looking to trace whether they had communicated on the matter any further.Based on the finding, the duo and a recipient of the email, who is yet to be identified, have been booked under IPC sections 120 (b), 121 and sections 17, 18, 19 and 40 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. More persons will be arraigned as accused in the case based on further investigation. Earlier, the police had found that Nazeer and Shahanas had conspired to influence witnesses in the Bangalore blast case by threatening and luring the witnesses and attempted to destroy the evidence with the help of one Thasleem, a native of Kannur.22-year-old Shahanas was arrested in November from the Ernakulam North railway station under suspicious circumstances and during an examination, the police also recovered eight letters, three mobile phones and two SIM cards from his possession. Nazeer is currently lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bengaluru while Shahanas is in the Ernakulam district jail at Kakkanad.
