Citizens on ‘low-tech’ cycles pedalling through potholed streets and garbage-infested spots have become part of a ‘high-tech’ solution to fix the city’s problems. HSR Layout’s experiment with mapping the problems in their ward – from black spots to potholes to areas where garbage is routinely set on fire – has caught the imagination of people in many other localities.Syed Imran, a resident of HSR Layout Sector 1, who spearheaded the project, says that residents’ groups from five wards – Basavanagudi, neighbouring Somasundarpalya, BTM Layout, Uttarahalli and Indiranagar – have approached them to develop a similar map for their areas. Even a few people from South Africa have contacted him.Active citizenry and a mobile phone are all that are needed for the project. Nearly 55 people had been selected in HSR Layout to cycle through the streets of the area and report problems. A picture – with the geo-tag of the phone switched on – is then sent to Mr. Imran who plots it on a map with a tag describing it as ‘major’, ‘huge’ or ‘minor’.“We update the plots weekly and share it with the BBMP’s zonal commissioner. Sitting in their office, they can see the kind of issues that need to be attended to on a priority basis,” he said.The advantage is that it is easier to visualise the bad roads in the sector. Looking at the plotting of potholes, it is obvious that the whole of 11th Cross needs to be asphalted. The concept was even sent to the Chief Minister’s Office, who in turn forwarded it to the concerned department to take immediate action.“It is working brilliantly. There is now a lot of data, which has become a dashboard for BBMP officials. We follow up to ensure that the problem is fixed,” says Zahid H. Javali, a resident who has started a WhatsApp group to coordinate between citizens and local elected representatives.
