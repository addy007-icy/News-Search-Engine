Even as the indefinite fasting by Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani completed three days on Wednesday, Youth Front (M) activists laid siege to the Rubber Board headquarters here demanding a lasting solution to the crisis in the natural rubber sector. According to YF leaders, three activists were injured when the police tried to remove them forcibly. They were taken to hospital.Meanwhile, P.C. George, chairman, Kerala Congress (Nationalist), on Wednesday alleged that the fast was only a ploy to mislead rubber farmers. According to him, Mr. Jose K. Maniâ€™s relatives were involved with a synthetic rubber trading firm. As such, there was no sincerity in the fight for natural rubber growers, he said.The venue of indefinite fasting witnessed a steady flow of visitors. A day-long fast by party activists in other districts will also be organised, a press note said.
