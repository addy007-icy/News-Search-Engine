As a prelude to the global investors meet to be held in Bengaluru next month, the district administration, in association with the District Industries Committee, will organise an investors meet at the Central Hall of the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha here on Thursday, where over 400 prospective investors would converge to explore the possibilities of venturing into various focussed sectors of agro and food processing, textiles, basic metal, general engineering, automobile and tourism sectors.As much as Rs. 15,000 crore of investment and creation of 15,000 jobs are expected from Thursdayâ€™s meet.Belagavi district, which is the second largest district in the State and is known as the sugar bowl of Karnataka, thrives mainly on its agrarian economy, supported by nine rivers and three irrigation dams. Belagavi city, which has common boundaries with Goa and Maharashtra, is being developed on the lines of a second capital of the State. It is connected by the railways, national highways and air. It is rich with a vast pool of educated and skilled human talent, with two government universities and one in the private sector offering undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in engineering, medicine and business management.Although Belagavi is regarded as the best among the tier two cities in the State, the pace of progress has not been as expected due to the slow pace of infrastructure developments, which was fundamental to attract large investments. A major problem that has been discouraging industrial growth is the shortage of good quality and uninterrupted power supply, the lifeline for growth in both the agriculture sector and industry.Ongoing developments include major roads that have been taken up for widening, construction of railway over-bridge and proposed flyover aimed at decongesting vehicular traffic in the city. The government has approved 24 x 7 drinking water supply project for all the 58 wards in the Belagavi City Corporation limits and the city is competing to be among the first 20 cities to be developed under the Smart City project of the Union government.An inland container depot at Desur, about 18 km from the city, a Government Tool Room Centre to provide technical cues and training, 13 industrial areas, a foundry cluster, hydraulics and automobile body building industries, a SEZ in aerospace engineering near Hattargi form an established infrastructure facility in the district.
