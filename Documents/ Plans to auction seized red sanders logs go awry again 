: The crisis in the Chinese economy has adversely affected the global sale of confiscated red sanders logs by the Andhra Pradesh government with the fourth phase of e-tender-cum-e-auction failing to evoke encouraging response.Number of biddersWith the three-day auction concluding on Thursday, official sources said the number of bidders might be less than 10 and the exact number would be known in the next couple of days.At the pre-bid meeting held earlier this week by the Forest Department, 10 prospective buyers participated and a majority of them were Chinese traders.However, for the second time in a row, the plans of the AP government to raise revenue through global sale of red sanders have been dented.The government hoped to raise around Rs. 1,000 crore through this round.Following the lukewarm response during the third phase, the government cancelled the bids of that round and announced that the fourth phase auction would be held from January 12 to 14 for the sale of 2,868 tonnes of seized red sanders logs.CurbsTalking to The Hindu , a top official said that with Chinese being most of the buyers during international bidding, the restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on transfer of foreign exchange have hit the fourth phase auction.“We expected 90 per cent of the logs to be sold this time,” he added.New strategyHe said the government would probably have to devise a new strategy for the sale to take place.Another phase of global auction would be conducted after one or two months.Fresh permissionto be soughtWith the Director General of Foreign Trade giving permission to the State government to complete the sale of seized stocks by April 30, 2016, the official said that fresh permission would be sought if the sale has to be conducted after that date.The first phase of global auction fetched Rs. 855 crore to the State exchequer, while the second phase yielded only Rs.178 crore.
