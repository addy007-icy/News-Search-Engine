The so-called progressive measures taken up by the Centre and the State governments are not inching towards any positive direction. Under the veil of smart city concept, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is only aiming at land pooling process by suppressing the oppressed classes, general secretary of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) Jagmati Sangwan has said.At a meeting at CITU office here on Thursday, she said that the State government’s ill-conceived policy of encouraging belt shops as a move to generate revenue was only ruining scores of families. Ms. Jagmati Sangwan came to the city to take part in the on-going 20{+t}{+h}All India conference of the National Federation of Indian Women. Pointing out the recent brutal action taken against Anganwadi workers, she said: “The State government is making an attempt to suppress the democratic struggle of the Anganwadi workers for just demanding better working conditions and salaries.”Supporting the statement, State president of AIDWA B. Prabhavathi said that Mr. Naidu expressed his solidarity with the struggles of Anganwadi workers when he was in the Opposition. “Subsequently, after coming to power, all the promises made have been forgotten. The State government initiated a vindictive action against Anganwadi workers who participated in ‘Chalo Vijayawada’ programme by issuing a GO to remove those who took part in the protest.” The AIDWA representatives felt that any GO should aim at strengthening people’s interest and not as a policy to meet a political vendetta and termed the removal of Anganwadi workers as ‘most reprehensible’.Members of AIDWA said that certain new regulations are likely to be implemented to deprive rural women from contesting in local body elections.
