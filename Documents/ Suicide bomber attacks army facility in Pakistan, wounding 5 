Police say a suicide car bomber has blown himself up outside the gate of an army facility in southwest Pakistan, wounding at least five people.Senior police officer Zahid Afzal says the attacker detonated the car bomb on Friday after being asked to halt in the district of Zob in Baluchistan province. He says a child, a civilian and three security force members were wounded in the attack.Shortly after the attack, Azam Tariq, a spokesman for a breakaway faction of Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility in a telephone call with The Associated Press.Earlier this month, another Taliban faction attacked a university in the northwest and killed 21 people, mostly students.
