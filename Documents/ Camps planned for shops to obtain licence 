However, many shops continue to run without registration certificate causing huge revenue loss and affecting the safety and rights of the employees.Labour officer (Enforcement Cell) S.K.Rao, in Puducherry, on Wednesday said that the Labour Department along with the Chamber of Commerce have organised the special camp to facilitate registration and renewal of the Establishments in all commune panchayat or municipalities.This is an annual drive which began in 2011. “Till 2010, there were only 8,484 shops registered under the Shops and Establishment Act. Beginning from 2011 to 2016, the number of shops registered has increased by 9,772. This has led to an increase in the revenue to the government as well,” he said.In total, there are 24,105 units registered under Shops and Establishments Act having a workforce of 68,281 and 2,472 units registered under the Catering Establishments Act, having a workforce of 14,627 in the Union Territory of Puducherry.Under the Shop Act and Catering Establishment Act, every employer has to obtain registration certificate and renew the same every year for three years.
