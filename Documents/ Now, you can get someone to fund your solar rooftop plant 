Have a large rooftop but not the financial resources to install a solar plant that could earn you some profit? There is sunlight at the end of this tunnel. You can now rope in a developer or financer to fund the project.In bid to boost power generation from solar energy by roping in more of its consumers to install rooftop solar plants, the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) has introduced a provision to have an interested third party fund the installation. This will involve three parties – the rooftop owner, the developer/financer and the power utility sign a tripartite agreement between themselves. The score card for solar generation under Bescom stands at around 3.4 MW at present, with miles to go to achieve the targets set by the State and Central governments.ProcedureThis is how it works: the rooftop owner (anyone with a valid consumer number) will first enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Bescom like it is done under the normal scheme. The basic requirement for a solar rooftop plant that generates 1 kW is a rooftop measuring 10 sq ft.Under the new provision, the rooftop owner will also enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the developer/project financers.Similar to the regular scheme, Bescom will pay for the excess power pumped into the grid from the solar plant. However, in this case, the developer or financer will have the first lien on cash flows generated and received. Bescom will route the payment for excess solar energy exported to a consumer-defined ‘Escrow’ account, with the developer having first right over the payments received.“Facilitators will be set up who will be able to guide rooftop owners willing to set up solar plants to interested developers,” a Bescom official told The Hindu.The tripartite agreement will be a long-term one, which will automatically be terminated at the end of completion of 25 years of operations. But the agreement can also be terminated with the mutual consent of both the developer and rooftop owner.
