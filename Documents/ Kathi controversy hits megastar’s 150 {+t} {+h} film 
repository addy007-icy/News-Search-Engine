People have been waiting for a long time to see the actor-turned-Rajya Sabha member K. Chiranjeevi in his 150{+t}{+h}film. And when his son Ramcharan Tej announced that he would produce his father’s landmark film and that it would be directed by V.V. Vinayak, with dialogues to be penned by Paruchuri Brothers, it was welcomed.According to Ramcharan, the 150{+t}{+h}film would be the Telugu version of the Kollywood’s Kathi that had Vijay as hero directed by A.R. Murugadoss. It was a hit last year, but from Day Two of its release on Tamil screens, a Telugu film director, Narasimha Rao, has been crying hoarse that 80 per cent of the scenes of Kathi were a part of an original story that he claimed to be his, slamming charges of plagiarism against Mr. Murugadoss. Mr. Narasimha Rao was associated with the Tamil director of Robot fame for some time in Kollywood and it was during that time that he said he had narrated his script to actor Vijay. However, it soon was shelved for various reasons. Later, he alleged that Mr. Murugadoss had taken his script and made Kathi with Mr. Vijay, which went on to become a success.And when Ramcharan announced that the 150{+t}{+h}film of his father was a Telugu remake of Kathi , Mr. Narasimha Rao took the matter to the notice of the United Forum of Telugu Film Directors, of which former Union Minister and popular director Dasari Narayana Rao is Chairman. It is said that the Forum promptly shot off a letter to the Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce demanding that Mr. Murugadoss be ‘ostracised’ for plagiarism as far as the Telugu industry was concerned.On Wednesday, a report in a Telugu television channel attracted attention and a mention of the same in the social media too, went viral. While the development cannot exactly be called a spanner in the works of Mr. Chiranjeevi’s much-awaited 150{+t}{+h}film, it has certainly led to tongues wagging, considering that he has not been on the best of terms with Mr. Dasari Narayana Rao.
