With the Union Ministry of Environment giving clearance for the execution of 2X800 MWs (1600) of coal-based Telangana Super Thermal Power project Stage-I at NTPC Ramgundam, the NTPC authorities are making efforts to rope in Prime Minister Narendra Modi for laying foundation stone for the project during his visit to Ramgundam on February 13, tentatively.Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, on Friday visited Ramgundam coal-belt and inspected the site for the laying of foundation for the Ramgundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (RFCL) by the Prime Minister.As Mr. Modi will be coming for the stone laying ceremony of RFCL, the NTPC authorities have been planning to hold the stone laying ceremony for the TSTTP project also on the same day.The 1600 MWs TSTTP stage-I would come up in the existing land of 2600 MW NTPC Ramgundam at a cost of Rs. 9,954.20 crore. This project was taken up as part of the AP States Reorganisation Act of 2014, which announced setting up of 4,000 MW of power plants through NTPC in Telangana State.Similarly, the second phase of 2,400 MWs of TSTTP will come on the same premises in the next stage.Incidentally, the power generated at the 1600 MWs TSTTP stage-I will be utilised by the Telangana State. The coal linkage for the project was made with the Singareni Collieries and other agencies.The NTPC authorities are giving priority to environmental protection programmes for the project by allocating Rs. 834.81 crore. They have decided to set up recycle ash water system and develop green cover around the ash pond to reduce pollution.NTPC is also setting up countryâ€™s tallest chimneys measuring 275 meters for the TSTTP. The authorities are also planning to make these two new units more efficient and consume less coal.
