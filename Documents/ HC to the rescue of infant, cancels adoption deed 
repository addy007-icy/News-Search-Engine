Upholding an infant’s rights, the Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday cancelled the adoption deed of 11-month-old Mulk Raj, whose parents had decided to give him in adoption to a “godman” from Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh.The Ajmer-based Pawan and Pooja had decided to give away the infant to the godman who had named Mulk Raj his successor.While Pawan and Pooja were determined to give their son to Rameshwar Dayal or Chhote Sarkar Maharaj for adoption, the grandparents had approached the High Court in July asking the court to either give the infant’s custody to them or the parents.In August last year, the court passed interim orders restraining the parents from handing over the infant to the godman, who currently heads the Dada Darbar Vedic cult.
