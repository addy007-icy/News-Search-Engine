It was a good development that many talented young persons were working in the field of literary and cultural research and also introducing innovative ideas. But simultaneously, they need to focus on reaching the rich cultural and literary heritage to the international audience, said senior researcher Hampa Nagarajaiah.Participating in a session, Talk with the researcher, where he replied to queries of R. Sesha Shastri, Mr. Nagarajaiah said that whatever had been done to introduce Kannada to foreigners so far was meagre when compared to the efforts made in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam. Young scholars with English knowledge should join hands in this task and facilitate translation of Kannada classics into English, he said.About the changing trends in literary research, he said that research on these topics would yield results and attract youngsters only if their values were discussed in relevance to modern times. He expressed satisfaction over ongoing research activities despite certain drawbacks.
