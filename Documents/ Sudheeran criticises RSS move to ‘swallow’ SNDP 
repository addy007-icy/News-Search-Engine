Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V. M. Sudheeran has fired the opening salvo against SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan on the eve of his much publicised ‘Jana Raksha Yatra’ scheduled to commence in Kasaragod on Monday.In a lengthy press release that set the tone for his one-month-long political tour of the State, Mr. Sudheeran condemned the RSS move to ‘swallow’ the socially reformist, essentially liberal and inherently progressive SNDP movement.He said the Prime Minister’s office and Mr. Natesan were responsible for the last minute withdrawal of the invitation to Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to participate in the unveiling of the R. Sankar statue in Kollam. Mr. Natesan’s newly launched party was an RSS front.The BJP’s bid to usurp the political legacy of R. Shankar would fail. Mr. Natesan’s actions and comments were deeply divisive and communal.Mr. Sudheeran touted the decision to close 730 non-5 star bar hotels as a singular social welfare achievement of the State government.He claimed there has been a record 20.27 per cent dip in the legal sale of alcohol since the policy was implemented in April last.The Supreme Court decision, which vindicated the government’s pro-prohibition stance, had given an added impetus to his ‘yatra’. It would conclude in the capital on February 9.Flagging rubber, coconut and cardamom prices had driven farmers to debt and poverty. Unrestricted import had caused the prices to deteriorate.He listed Vizhinjam port, Kochi Smart City, Kochi Metro Rail and Kannur airport as major achievements of the ruling front.Landless people, pesticide victims and KSRTC pensioners were duly compensated, activities of loan sharks curbed and campuses rid of drugs and tobacco, Mr. Sudheeran said.
