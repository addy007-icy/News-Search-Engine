Rejecting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s charge that Congress was responsible for the logjam in Parliament, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, on Tuesday said it was the BJP that “opposed and stalled” the crucial reforms including the Goods and Service Tax (GST) and Insurance bills when the UPA was in power.In a press statement, Mr. Sharma said compared to the BJP’s performed as an opposition party during UPA I and II, the Congress has been “responsible and mature” in its approach.“The fact that the Rajya Sabha in the last 18 months has passed 45 bills, including the Insurance bill, and amended and enacted the Acts for Coal, Mines and Minerals besides passing the historic Constitutional amendment on the land boundary agreement with Bangladesh which was vehemently opposed by the BJP in the opposition, cannot be ignored,” said Mr.Sharma.Accusing the BJP government of being “arrogant and confrontationist,” Mr. Sharma said there cannot be any “consultative engagement achieved by targeting, blaming and insulting the Congress leadership.”“The continuous tirade is also a divisionary tactic to deflect focus from the miserable failure of the BJP government on all fronts,” he said.
