Actor Simbu has moved the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Director General of Police (DGP) to issue a circular to all the police stations in the State not to register any further FIR against him over the ‘beep’ song row.The actor submitted that already two FIRs have been registered against him in Coimbatore and Chennai for allegedly distributing a music track containing words degrading the modesty of women. “Besides the two FIRs various complaints are being filed on the same issue by individuals as well as associations who are not aggrieved persons before various police stations throughout the State,” the petitioner said.Simbu alleged that since he is a well known and established actor in the Tamil film industry, most of such complaints were given for the sake of publicity and with an ulterior motive to extract money from him.Claiming that none of the complainants have any personal interest or in no way they are affected by the circulation of the alleged song, the petitioner sought for a direction to control such frivolous complaints.
