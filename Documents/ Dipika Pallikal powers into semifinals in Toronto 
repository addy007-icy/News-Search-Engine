Last year’s runner-up Dipika Pallikal moved into the semifinals of the Granite Open squash tournament after a convincing win over Egyptian Salma Hany Ibrahim in Toronto.The 17th-ranked Indian and second seed defeated her 27th-ranked opponent 12-10, 11-2, 11-4 in the quarterfinals held on Wednesday.Except in the first game where the fifth seeded Egyptian went close, Pallikal kept things her way to complete her task in 34 minutes. She faces Nicolette Fernandes, the sixth seed from Guyana, in the semifinals.“I knew it was going to be tough against Salma as I got chopped in three games the last time I played against her. The first game was crucial and it was good that I won it after trailing 7-10. From there on I became more confident and that helped in the next two games. Very pleased with the win as Salma is such a talented player,” said Pallikal.
