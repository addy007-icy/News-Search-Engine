The government is yet to implement the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission, which has been pending since 2013 and which gives the corporations a bigger share of taxes.“We want the government to pay us according to the Third Finance Commission as they have not been giving us our dues for years now,” said Mr. Arya.According to the BJP leaders, the corporations are due to receive Rs. 3,000 crore as per the Third Finance Commission, and about Rs.6,000 crore if the Fourth Finance Commission is implemented.The civic bodies say they have been getting less funds every year from the government, with the municipal reform fund and global share of taxes being deducted from the payments. The government, meanwhile, said that it does not owe the corporations anything.Civic bodies say they are getting less funds fromthe government every year
