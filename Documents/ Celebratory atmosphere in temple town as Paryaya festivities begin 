A celebratory atmosphere prevailed in the temple town as the Paryaya festivities began late on Sunday evening.People were also aware that they were witnessing history being made as Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt will be ascending the Paryaya Peetha, also known as Sarvajna Peetha, at the 800-year-old Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple for a record fifth time on Monday.No seer of the Ashta Mutts or eight mutts of Udupi has ascended the Paryaya Peetha over four times ever since the biennial Paryaya system began in 1522.Paryaya denotes transfer of power of the exclusive rights of worshipping Lord Krishna and management of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple from one seer to another seer of the Astha Mutts once in two years in turns. The city was teeming with devotees who had come not just from different parts of the State but also the country. The Car Street saw a maximum number of devotees going around visiting not just the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple, which was the cynosure of all eyes but also the Ashta Mutts or eight mutts of Udupi.In fact, the queue to offer prayers to Lord Krishna at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple was so long that it stretched nearly to the Rajangana Parking Space. Since Udupi is known as “Anna Brahma Kshetra,” there was a massive rush for the afternoon meals as well at the dining halls of the Sri Krishna Mutt.Even the store-hall, where rice, coconuts and vegetables such as pumpkins, Mangalore cucumber, Mattu Gulla, Elephant Yams, and others were stored, was a centre of attraction. This was because the vegetables were kept in a systematic way and eye-catching.Meanwhile, the cooks had a busy time at the temporary kitchen, created behind the Adhoksha Mantapa. They were cooking food for over 75,000 devotees.Various cultural programmes and orchestras were held at Chittaranjan Circle, Kinnimulki and other intersections of the city. At night, both the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple and the Pejawar Mutt, which were beautifully illuminated, were the centres of attraction. Almost all buildings on the main streets of the city were illuminated. The main roads, where the Parayaya procession passed through, were decorated with arches, buntings and banners hailing Vishwesha Tirtha and Vishwaprasanna Tirtha, junior seer of Pejawar Mutt.
