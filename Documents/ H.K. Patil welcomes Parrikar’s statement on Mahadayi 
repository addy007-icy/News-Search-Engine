Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patil has welcomed the announcement of Defence Minister and the former Chief Minister of Goa Manohar Parrikar to intervene in the Mahadayi water dispute between the riparian States of Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra and help find an early solution to it.Mr. Patil told presspersons on the sidelines of “Sankalp Dina” programme organised by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj at the Central Hall of Suvarna Vidhana Soudha here on Friday, that though Chief Minister Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the Goa government seeking an appointment to discuss the water row last month, the latter is yet to reply. However, as Mr. Parrikar was willing to intervene, the doors for discussion would be opened. Hopefully, this will lead to some necessary and early relief, Mr. Patil said.
