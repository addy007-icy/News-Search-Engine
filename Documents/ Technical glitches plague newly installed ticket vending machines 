The recently installed Cash/Smartcard operated Ticket Vending Machine (CCoTVM) in many railway stations in the city seem to be having ‘teething troubles.’Frequent errors making it unusable and printing of blank white sheet of paper instead of journey tickets are some complaints commuters have.On Wednesday morning, the machine installed at Chennai Central station displayed an ‘error message’ informing visitors that it cannot dispense tickets at the moment. However, passengers did not have a problem as the manually operated platform ticket counter was functioning at the time.(The platform ticket counter was shifted a couple of months ago closer to the main entrance and was moved back to its original spot recently). Srini Swaminathan who inserted a Rs. 5 coin at the CCoTVM in St. Thomas Mount got only a blank white sheet. He then got a ticket from the counter to Chennai Beach.He shared his experience on twitter (@srini091), tagging @RailMinIndia, the official account of the Ministry of Railways.The Ministry in turn tagged the Divisional Railway Manager, Chennai, who replied to the tweet asking for his contact number.“I gave my phone number to them. No one got back,” Mr. Swaminathan said. Southern Railway officials said CCoTVMs were easy to operate compared to the Automatic Ticket Vending Machines, which required commuters to swipe a smart card.Commuters can get suburban train and platform tickets apart from recharging smart cards.It was just about a month since the new machines were installed and they were getting feedback on the errors and problems faced by commuters, they added.Soon after the machines were installed, engineers briefed the staff of the Commercial department of the Southern Railways at length about how the machines had to be operated.All the technical defects would be sorted, officials said, and hoped the machines will function without a glitch soon.Many commuters complained that the machines printed out blank sheets of paper
