The annual flower show, being organised by the Department of Horticulture, returns to the city with a difference in its area and themes from Monday.The three-day event will be held at Hume Park on Club Road here in the city. The venue of the event has been shifted to a larger area, nearly one-and-a-half acres, at the same premises. In addition to the exhibition of flowers, there will be a fruit and vegetable show and floral arrangements on various themes. This year, a model on “green house” has been included to popularise the scientific method of farming among the farmers.Cultural programmes by school children and young artists would be organised in the evening all the three days.That apart, private nursery units and sellers of various farm inputs, including organic manure and food products, home made foods.The visitors could also buy flower pots prepared by the Department for the occasion at the end of the event or on the following day, said Ravindra Hakate told presspersons here on Sunday.Mr. Hakates said the concept of Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) was slowly gaining momentum in the district. So far three FPOs had come into existence, each consisting of 1,000 farmers, most of them small and marginal vegetable growers in Kakti of Belagavi taluk, Nipani and Chikkodi in Chikkodi taluk during 2014-15. Two more FPOs were coming up in Hukkeri and Gokak. The Union government had introduced the Farmer Producer Organisation concept with the objective of collectivisation of the small and marginal farmers by ensuring the support of both the Central and State government funded schemes and create an assured market for them by creating partners representing wide range of institutions, including the corporate sector.
