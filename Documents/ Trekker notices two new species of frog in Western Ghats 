Hurudi Vikram, an environmentalist and trekker in Western Ghats, has said that recently, he noticed two distinct frogs in the region and wanted experts to study them and explore their distinct features.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Vikram said that one from he across near Yettinahalla in Western Ghats, was very small and had stripes that were similar to the stripes of a tiger. “I took a picture of the frog after making it sit on a one rupee coin. It can seen in places close to water bodies. For my reference, I named it as Yettinahalla Hurudi Vikram (YHV). Biologists have identified many rare species of animals in Western Ghats. I believe, this frog has not been noticed by anyone so far,” he claimed.Mr. Vikram exhibited a picture of another frog with a transparent body. “This was also noticed recently in the same region. It lives on plants and trees near water bodies. I request the experts to study these frog species,” he said.GanjaMr. Vikram, resident of Huradi, a village located close to Western Ghats in Sakleshpur taluk, said he noticed some people cultivating ganja in the forest area.“It is difficult to keep a tab on the cultivators of ganja in deep forest areas. It is better if the Forest Department uses a helicopter and keeps vigil at regular intervals from the sky across the ghat section to catch criminals,” he suggested.
