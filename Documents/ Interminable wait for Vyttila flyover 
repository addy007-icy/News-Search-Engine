Traffic snarls would continue at Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers for some more months to come as the prospects for the construction of flyovers at these two busy spots have turned bleak.The State government is in no mood to implement the projects and its looking up to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for the implementation of the projects. The government developed cold feet after the State Finance department objected to the government investing in the project. The department was not in favour of the government investing in the flyover projects that are to come up in holdings owned by the NHAI.The Finance Department has suggested the Public Works Department to find out whether the NHAI was willing to implement the project without slapping toll on vehicles using the facility. A.P.M. Muhammad Hanish, the secretary of the Department and K.P. Prabhakaran, the Chief Engineer of the National Highway wing of the State government will hold discussions with the NHAI authorities at New Delhi shortly, said V.K. Ibrahim Kunju, the Public Works Minister.The PWD had proposed a six-lane flyover for Vyttila spending Rs. 109 crore.If the NHAI does not evince interest in implementing the project according to the design and specifications prepared by the PWD, the State government can implement it.The detailed project report for the flyovers was ready. The projects were also accorded in principle approvals, said Mr. Hanish.For implementing the NHAI proposal, said Mr. Ibrahim Kunju, large tracts of land had to be acquired and a large number of shops demolished. Moreover, the NHAI had made it clear that toll needs to be collected, according to Mr. Kunju.
