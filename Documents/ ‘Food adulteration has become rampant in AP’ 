Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State general secretary S. Suresh Reddy on Monday demanded that the government recruit adequate number of food inspectors and provide enough funds for creating infrastructure such as laboratories for implementing the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFAA) in a foolproof manner.Adulteration of food has assumed an alarming proportion in the State. Implementing the PFAA is so appalling in AP that there are just 22 food inspectors, the BJP leader said.Addressing the media here, Mr. Suresh Reddy said that there was no commodity which was not being adulterated with dangerous substances. From milk to drinking water and fruits to edible oils and even meat were being adulterated as there was no mechanism to monitor such unscrupulous activities and punish the guilty who were posing a grave threat to the public health.He pointed out that there were 750 food inspectors in Maharashtra, 535 in Tamil Nadu and 240 in Kerala. But, successive governments in A.P were not bothered with the meagre number of food inspectors, leave alone leave alone plugging the loopholes in law.Mr. Suresh Reddy said the situation in Nellore district, from which he hails, was so bad that out of nearly 400 RO plants including 150 situated in the district headquarters, there was not even a single ISI-certified plant.Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should pay personal attention to the menace and take the necessary action, Mr. Reddy added. BJP leaders J. Syam Kishore, K. Kapileswara Rao and Jupudi Rangaraju and BJP Mazdoor Morcha leader K.V. Subba Rao were present.
