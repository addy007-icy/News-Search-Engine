A four-lane access controlled corridor that will link Chakkaraparambu on Palarivattom-Vyttila NH Bypass with Seaport Airport Road is set to become a reality, with a decision being taken to commence land acquisition.The first phase of the project will be executed in between Seaport-Airport Road and Arakkakadavu on Vennala-Eroor Road. A joint team of District Administration and Kerala State Construction Corporation will undertake a survey of the proposed road, for acquiring 40 acres of land. A letter will shortly be given to State government seeking permission to begin land acquisition. This was decided at a meeting held here on Monday chaired by PWD Principal Secretary A P M Mohammed Hanish. The 4-km-long corridor is set to cost Rs 412 crore. The new road will throw open an eastward corridor for Padma Junction-Pullepady-Thammanam-Chakkaraparambu Road. The road and bridges in the route are expected to cost Rs 143 crore, while land acquisition is expected to cost Rs 270 crore.A detailed project on the road was prepared by KITCO in 2013. Steps will be taken to rehabilitate people in land that will be identified in the vicinity. Benny Behanan, MLA, District Collector M G Rajamanickam and MD of KSCC Santosh Kumar were among those present at Mondayâ€™s meeting.The road will have 30-metre width for 1.5 km from Chakkaraparambu up to Vennala-Eroor Road, while the rest of the alignment will have 45-metre width since most of the area is now paddy fields. It could later be extended up to Infopark, sources said.
