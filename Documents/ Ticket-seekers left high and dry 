The last day of nomination filing saw high political drama with GHMC aspirants making last minute dash to returning officers even as they frantically worked to ascertain their party’s backing.At a press conference on Sunday evening, GHMC commissioner B. Janardhan Reddy announced that 2,696 nominations were received, with representatives of TRS filing 698 nominations, which is more than those filed by other parties.Representatives of Congress filed 501 nominations while 506 from TDP, 308 from BJP, 61 from MIM, 28 from CPI, 29 from CPM, 82 from BSP, 31 from Loksatta and 683 from independents were also received.Parties had not announced their list of candidates until the last minute and the run up to the nominations thus saw political drama played out at party offices and residences of senior party leaders. In women reserved wards, women relatives and wives of aspirants and party bigwigs were learnt to have filed nominations. Of the 150 wards, only 44 are unreserved.It was also learnt on Sunday evening that the major parties had not fielded candidates in all wards.Congress for instance fielded candidates only in 94 wards while TRS is said to have nominated in 143 wards.BJP had kept its candidates in dark until last minute but it was learnt that the party is fielding candidates in 63 wards while TDP is said to have nominated candidates in 87 wards.Given that more than one candidate in each ward has filed nomination claiming a party’s representation the scrutiny on Monday will reveal nominated candidates. The last date for withdrawing nominations is January 21.Candidates who do not receive a party’s nomination can opt to contest as independents.As politicking before the elections gets frenzied, the GHMC is working to ensure the poll conduct is not violated.The commissioner announced on Sunday that nearly 1.5 lakh advertising material, including flexis and posters, were removed from the city so far.
