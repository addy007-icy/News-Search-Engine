The KSIC is looking to corporates to strengthen its brand image. After bagging the contract from Air India for supplying 10,000 silk saris to its flight attendants and ground staff, it recently supplied silk scarves to the women members of Spices Board.“Order for additional silk scarves has been placed by the board,” said KSIC chairman D. Basavaraja. In the past, the silk weaving factory produced saris for sportspersons who bagged the Arjuna awards. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission also procured the saris for its staff. The company recurrently gets orders from the Karnataka Legislature.
