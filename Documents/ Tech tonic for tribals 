The technology-intensive solutions proposed in the article “Tech tonic for the heart of India” (Jan.15) should enable the state to respond better to the Maoist insurgency. The proposal to integrate the Adivasis with the mainstream polity through Internet and shortwave radio, with focus on local languages, is a commendable one. After failures of a ‘tit for tat’ military approach such as that involving the vigilante Salwa Judum forces, the state can take steps to inform and engage the citizenry to make them feel more empowered.P.
