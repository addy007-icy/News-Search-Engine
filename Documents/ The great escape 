Captain Aditya Tare smashed an unbeaten 65 to help Mumbai overhaul a target of 156 set by Maharashtra and ensure its knockout stage qualification, elbowing out its State rival on net run-rate (NRR) at the DRIEMS ground in Cuttack on Friday.Mumbai faced a premature exit as Maharashtra appeared the favourite for second spot in Group D of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy inter-State T20 tournament, enjoying the advantage on points (12) and NRR.Tare’s explosive batting overturned the calculations as he nixed Maharashtra bowling attack, hitting four sixes and three boundaries in an undefeated knock of 65 off 35 balls and took Mumbai past the victory mark. After its bowlers had restricted Maharashtra to a relatively moderate 155 with a disciplined effort, Mumbai needed to reach the target within 18.3 overs to overtake the former on NRR, as a win for the latter would have seen a tie for second spot on 12 points.Run-riotShowing character in a crisis, Shreyas Iyer began the run-riot for Mumbai, punishing both Domnic Muthuswamy and Anupam Sanklecha, who shared the new ball for Maharashtra. After his opening partner Akhil Herwadkar (21) departed early, Iyer opened the sluice gates, scoring a breezy 38 (23b, 4x4, 1x6) and sharing a stand of 49 for the second wicket with Tare.After Iyer was caught at long-on by Maharashtra’s Rahul Tripathi, Tare began the demolition act with even greater intensity, punishing every Maharashtra bowler except young left-arm spinner Satyajeet Bachhav, who kept the batsmen quiet in his quota of four overs (4-0-20-1).Tare, who was given company till the end by Siddhesh Lad (31*), got the required runs in the first ball of the 17th over to help Mumbai tally a NRR of +0.621, which was well ahead of Maharashtra’s +0.152. The confidence and application that marked the previous three wins of Maharashtra was clearly missing as the team started badly against its old rival. The batsmen were unusually slow at the start, which affected the overall run-making process on a wicket which was conducive to stroke-making. The efforts of the Maharashtra batsmen, including Kedar Jadhav (29), Nikhil Naik (31) and Prayag Bhati (36) thus remained ineffective at the end.Uttar Pradesh completed an all-win record by beating Services by 57 runs in another match. This helped it top the league standings with 20 points from five wins. Karnataka salvaged some pride by beating Odisha by six wickets and took the fourth position.BRIEF SCORESMaharashtra 155/8 in 20 overs (Kedar Jadhav 29, Nikhil Naik 31, Prayag Bhati 36; Pravin Tambe 2/24) lost to Mumbai 157/2 in 16.1 overs (Shreyas Iyer 38, Aditya Tare 65*, Siddhesh Lad 31*).Odisha 102/7 in 20 overs (Abhishek Yadav 31; KC Cariappa 2/14, Shreyas Gopal 2/15) lost to Karnataka 106/4 in 17.5 overs (Robin Uthappa 48, Stuart Binny 32*; Tukuna Sahu 2/17).Uttar Pradesh 182/6 in 20 overs (Prashant Gupta 43, Eklavya Dwivedi 89, Saurabh Dubey 38*; Raushan Raj 3/43) bt Services 125/9 in 20 overs (Yashpal Singh 47, Vikas Hathwale 31; Ankit Rajpoot 2/11).
