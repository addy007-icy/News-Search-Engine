The imposition of President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh has brought to the fore once again the blatant misuse of Article 356 in order to meet partisan political ends (“ >SC seeks proof of breakdown in Arunachal”, Jan.28).With the Congress now challenging the proclamation in the Supreme Court, which in 1994 had asserted and declared in unequivocal terms that the imposition of President’s rule in a State has to be approved by both Houses of Parliament, one feels that the day is not far off when the higher judiciary will once again ensure that most political processes are now rooted in norms of democracy.M. Jeyaram,Sholavandan, Tamil NaduIt is amusing that the Congress party, which has the distinction of destabilising popular State governments and imposing Article 356 most of the time it has been in power, is now crying foul over the developments. When it is a fact that no party has a majority in the Assembly, what better option did the Centre have than to impose Central rule in the State? Further, in view of its strategic location, Arunachal Pradesh cannot afford to be without an authoritative administration for a long period.Kshirasagara Balaji Rao,HyderabadThe imposition of Article 356 is the right move. The ruling party and the Opposition appeared to be avoiding a floor test and it is clear that there is a lack of confidence and courage to lead from the front.Chumrei Jajo,New DelhiOur 67th Republic Day celebrations may have passed but our politicians have displayed yet again a lack of respect for constitutional conventions. The controversial decision will have political repercussions, as, once again, the BJP has united the Opposition and given it a legitimate reason to protest ahead of the crucial Budget session of Parliament. Chief Minister Nabam Tuki should have shown political grace by calling for an Assembly session and facing the challenge of the dissidents.J.S. Acharya,Hyderabad
