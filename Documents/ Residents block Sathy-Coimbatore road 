Members of a community residing at Adi-Dravidar Colony in Nallur blocked the Sathy-Coimbatore road for a few hours on Monday protesting against what they complained as the hindrance caused by another community in performing last rites of a deceased resident.Relatives and neighbours of Veluchamy (30), a painter, who had reportedly drowned while on a visit to his in-lawâ€™s house at Sirumugai, sat on the road placing the body in the middle in protest against the opposition by another group to the choice of graveyard.Superintendent of Police M.R. Sibi Chakravarthy and other senior officials rushed to the spot and held talks with the two groups.While the traffic was restored after the body was sent to the Sathy Government Hospital for post-mortem, there was no end to the stand-off over the choice of location for performing last rites in the graveyard in the locality, till late in the evening, local sources said.
