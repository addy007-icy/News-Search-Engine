BJP Legislature Party leader in the Odisha Assembly Basanta Kumar Panda is all set to become next president of the party in the State to replace Kanak Vardhan Singh Deo.Although the party has scheduled Thursday as the date for filing of nominations for the election of the new State president, efforts are on to work out a consensus on Mr. Panda’s name.Apart from being a grassroot leader, Mr. Panda represents Nuapada Assembly constituency in western Odisha, and is in good terms with Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan as well as those managing the affairs in the RSS.As per the schedule, the candidates can file their nominations between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and withdraw their papers between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Thursday. If there are more than one candidates, then the election will be held on Friday.A source in the party, however, said such a situation is not likely to arise and Mr. Panda would be elected the new president unanimously. All the office-bearers of the party in the State, including a Member of Parliament and 10 legislators, are likely to remain present at the party State headquarters for the election.The leaders who have been given charge to work out a consensus are trying to reach out to other senior leaders and discussing about Mr. Panda’s election to ensure no dissidence and damage to the party’s image.
