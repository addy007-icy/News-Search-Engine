Odisha law minister Arun Sahu on Thursday came on the firing line of the ongoing egg attacks on the ministers when he was travelling in the city. The minister was in the city to open the headquarters of the BJD legal cell here at Markat Nagar and while he was entering into the city through the Naraj road, some youths pelted eggs onto his car near the Biren Mitra Park in Sector 10 of the satellite city.Confirming the report, a senior police officer said the eggs missed the ministerâ€™s car. The police said the miscreants escaped from the spot taking the best use of the darkness at the spot. The minister however, went ahead with his scheduled programme, the police officer said.
