If Britons vote to leave the European Union at a membership referendum due by the end of 2017, the government will have to make it work, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday.An opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Britons who have made up their mind would vote to leave the EU. Mr. Cameron said he did not think that leaving the EU would be the right decision if he achieves his planned reforms to Britain’s relationship with the bloc.“The British public will make their decision. We must obey that decision whatever it is,” the Conservative party leader told BBC’s Andrew Marr. “I don’t think that [exit] is the right answer ... Were that to be the answer, we would have to do everything necessary to make that work.”Asked whether the government was making contingency plans for a possible exit, Mr. Cameron said it had plans for the renegotiation and referendum.
