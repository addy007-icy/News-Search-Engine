The Chennai floods seem to have taught the City police an important lesson — to improve their coordination with other agencies.They are now creating a database of people who can help in rescue operations in case of an emergency. The police claim to have rescued several thousand people during the floods. Drones were also used to identify those stranded in different parts of the city, especially southern suburbs.“One major hurdle we faced was mobilising people and also the logistics to save the people. Hence, we are creating a database of swimmers, owners of boats, lorries and tractors and also non-governmental organisations, among others who can be contacted immediately during a disaster,” said a police officer.The police have taken this decision based on a feedback from residents.“A major problem we faced was that we were unable to use boats in narrow lanes to resue people,” said a police officer.The police force in the southern part of the city prepared a database immediately after the November floods. “We collected the numbers of all boat-owners and swimmers in the coastal areas. This helped us a lot in December,” added a police officer.Sources also want the government to provide training to as many policemen as possible in swimming and rescue techniques.“It will be better if each station has a good swimmer who is an expert in diving and rescue,” said an inspector.
