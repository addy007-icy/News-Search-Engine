In an attempt to have more influence in the functioning of Indian Academy Paediatrics (IAP) and focus more on women, women members of IAP announced the launch of its women’s wing here on Friday. Close to 5,000 women paediatricians, who are already the members of IAP, have now come together to form the Women’s Wing. “Women paediatricians had so far taken a back seat. However, it’s high time we are more assertive and play proactive role,” said National Convener for IAP, Women’s Wing, T. Himabindu Singh.
