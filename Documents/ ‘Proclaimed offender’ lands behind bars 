A ‘proclaimed offender’ was put behind bars for six months although the primary case against the accused was not proved due to lack of evidence.Chakali Raja (25) from Guntakal town had relatives in Papampalli of Atmakur mandal. During one of his visits to the village in August 2011, he eloped with a married woman of the village. Subsequently, a case of missing of the woman was filed and Raja was arrested, but released on bail. However, while the trial in the case was going on at the Assistant Additional Sessions Judge Court here, the accused did not attend the court and has been absconding. Subsequently, the court summoned the two persons who had given surety bonds on the behalf of Raja and directed them to produce the accused in court. As they failed to do so, the court directed them to pay the amount as assured in the bonds and let them off.Raja was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’ by the court under Section 82 of the CrPC in April 2013. Nonetheless, the charges against the accused could not be proved. But, police had filed a suo moto case against the accused under Section 174 A and Section 229 A of the IPC. While the first provides for imprisonment of a ‘proclaimed offender’ besides a monetary fine, the latter provides for imprisonment when a person released on bail or bond fails to appear in court without sufficient reason. Both sections came in handy to the police.Though the case against the accused was struck by the court, the Atmakur police arrested Raja in July 2015 and proceedings against him under the Section 174 A and Section 229 A of the IPC. On Friday, the Judicial First Class Magistrate (JFCM) court sentenced Raja to imprisonment for six months.
