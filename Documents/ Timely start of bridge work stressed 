Timely completion of the third phase of Ring Road project linking Kangeyam Road with Thindal by the Highways Department hinges on prompt construction of Rail Over Bridge at Jeeva Nagar by the Indian Railways.While the Highways Department has been racing against time to carry out the road-laying work, the Railways, it appears, has not taken any serious initiative so far.Fortunately, for the Highways Department, the court judgements on land acquisitions have been in its favour, and hence the road-laying work has gathered momentum. Completion of the seven-km stretch of the third phase will substantially decrease traffic congestion in the city limits as the need for buses, lorries and other vehicles proceeding to Coimbatore from Namakkal to enter Erode city will get obviated.The third phase is slated for completion by February-March 2017, provided the Railways does its part in time, sources say.
