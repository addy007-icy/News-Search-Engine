The KTU has developed in-house software for handling the question papers and another for handling answer papers post-evaluation.The software for question papers would allow the KTU to ‘push’ one question paper from among five sets to colleges minutes before an examination. This can be opened only through providing two one-time passwords that are sent to the mobile phone of the chief superintendent of examinations in each college.The software for handling answer sheets allows evaluators to swipe, on a scanner, the barcode in the facing sheet of each answer booklet after evaluation.The system would automatically recognise the student; the evaluator then has only to enter the marks into the system.The tabulation too would then be done by the system.“Whether we switch to an online mode for the conduct of our second semester B.Tech examinations depends on the proposals we receive and the government decision in this matter,” Mr. Abdul Rahman added.
