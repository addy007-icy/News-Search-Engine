On the occasion of New Year, pilgrims arrived in large numbers at Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada of Karimnagar district on Friday.Thousands of pilgrims from across the State and other parts of the country arrived in large numbers to offer prayers to the presiding deities - Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi. The devotees formed serpentine queues for darshan and for offering the traditional ‘kode mokku’ at the shrine after taking holy dip in the holy tank. Following the heavy pilgrims rush at the shrine, the devasthanam authorities allowed ‘laghu darshan’ for the fast movement of queue lines and early darshan.
