In early July, when the City police came out with a report on optimising traffic through a set of wide-ranging modifications and changes, even the top brass of the police were uncertain how it all would work out.Six months later, the situation on the city’s most important thoroughfare, the MG Road, stands out as a classic example of positive change. And the concept is all set to go further ahead. From total chaos that used to be the norm before right from East Fort and stretching beyond Secretariat, there is some semblance of order now, i.e., when there are no rallies or processions, on the 1.6-km stretch from Pulimoodu to East Fort.There are neatly marked parking zones, separate ones for two-wheelers and four-wheelers and No Parking areas as well. There are traffic wardens collecting fees for parking and traffic policemen imposing fines on violators of ‘No Parking’ rules.The Vellayambalam-Sasthamangalam Road too is a lot similar, with more components of what constitute a Model Road being implemented on this 1.2-km stretch. The components include strict enforcement of helmet rules, wearing of seatbelts, ‘Keep Left’ practices and a lane traffic system, a continuing awareness creation campaign through megaphone announcements, distribution of pamphlets to road users, in short, everything that comprises what and how traffic should be – safe and as per rules.Now, according K. Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order), who prepared the traffic optimisation report as per which the changes are being brought in, the Model Road concept is being extended to other important roads in the city.While the concept went live for the Choorakkatupalayam-New Flyover late in December, with a vast difference already beginning to be seen, it will be implemented from Pulimoodu till Kesavadasapuram very soon.The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has so far been supportive of the move, and was expected to ratify the concept soon. There were minor glitches, like shortage of manpower to ensure proper collection of parking fee and fines and so on, apart from delays in finalising the modalities of utilization of the money collected etc., which are in the process of being rectified.“On the whole, the concept can be termed a major success, and we are carrying it forward,” Mr. Sanjay Kumar said.Earlier, chaos wasthe norm on theEast Fort-Secretariat stretch; now there is some order.
