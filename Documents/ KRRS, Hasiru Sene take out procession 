Members of the Chitradurga district unit of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene took out a procession and staged a dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Wednesday urging the district administration to deposit compensation to the bank amounts of farmers to avoid misuse of funds.The agitators took out the procession from the Ambedkar Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office.The agitators said that farmers in all the six taluks of the district are in distress owing to adverse climatic conditions in the last four years and after sustained efforts by farmer associations, the authorities concerned conducted a detailed survey and decided to pay compensation. But there is every possibility that compensation amount was misused, if it is paid through cheque.So the officers concerned should be instructed to deposit compensation amount directly to bank accounts of farmers.The agitators submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Srirangaiah and said that the agitation would be intensified if the authorities failed to fulfil their demand.
