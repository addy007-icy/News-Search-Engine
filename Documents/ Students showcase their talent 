Going by the scale of the event or performances of the ‘culturally-enriched’ school students, it is hard to guess that a government backed school-chain could put up such a spectacle. If the students gaining entry in to the IITs in hordes with their teaching excellence is one side of success story of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, then the two-day National Integration Meet 2015-16 held in the city gave a glimpse of the extra-curricular focus of the institution.About 600 students from over 100 Navodaya schools across the country participated in the event which focused on the themes ‘India of my Dreams’ and ‘Cultural Heritage of my District.’ The Navodaya Vidalayas, with one branch in Gachibowli, is run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, an autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Human Resources Development.Praising the organisation for providing near-free education for children from economically and socially backward families, Governor ESL Narasimhan said that the school now needs to compete in the urban landscape with other reputed educational institutions.Mr. Narasimhan, who was the chief guest for the valedictory function, felt that the theme was very relevant as it was important to showcase the heritage and culture of India to the outside world.Some of the programmes that were part of the event included seminar on climate change, theatre festival, painting exhibition besides others.
