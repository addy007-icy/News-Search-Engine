What could be termed as a costly mistake, the lack of mobile phone alert for transactions in the banks by the Agriculture Department resulted in swindling off of Rs. 3.13 crore in a span of 17 days.According to B. Hukya Naik, Joint Director, Agriculture, one K. Manaiah had been working as the DTP operator in the department as an outsourced employees for the past seven years.Though he was authorised to operate only the computer, the office staff used his services for banking activities, including depositing cheques and withdrawal of money. This was not limited to only office activities but even for personal banking as well.The banker was authorised to pay the amount after cross checking the signature of the JD Agriculture.According to sources in the department, between December 31, 2015, and January 5, Mr. Manaiah was able to issue cheques as follows: December 31, 2015 – Rs. 9.99 lakh, January 1 – Rs. 6.95 lakh, Rs. 6.9 lakh (date is not available), January 2 – Rs. 7.60 lakh and Rs. 7.70 lakh, January 4 – Rs. 7.3 lakh and Rs. 7 lakh, January 5 – Rs. 7 lakh and Rs. 6 lakh, and on January 11 – Rs. 9.7 lakh, Rs. 9.25 lakh, Rs. 9.3 lakh and Rs. 9.15 lakh.In another complaint lodged with the police on Friday evening, the Agriculture Department informed the police that another Rs. 2.1 crore was swindled off from APGVB Shantinagar Branch in Sangareddy between December 30, 2015, and January 16 this year.“All our staff trusted him and used his services for banking activities, and sometimes even handed him their ATM cards. Manaiah managed to take some 12 leaves from the cheque book from the desk of one Shyam Sunder, an official in the department. He even managed to forge my signature on the cheques, and swindled funds to the tune of Rs. 1.03 crore. We have lodged a complaint with the rural police,” Mr Hukya Naik told The Hindu .When asked why the department, which deals with crores of rupees every year, failed to activate cellphone alert for every transaction that takes place in the bank, he said that there was no such practice in the past and he followed the same.Surprisingly, not only the Agriculture Department, no other department has been using the facility so far, and this was confirmed by a senior government official.“This may not be limited to only Medak district. There may be a similar situation across the State,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.It was only after suspicion by the banks staff that something was fishy, the officials came to know what happened under their noses. They then instructed the banks to stop the cheque payment.Mr. Manaiah was arrested by the Sangareddy (Rural) Police. Sub-Inspector Shivalingam said that they will be in a position to come up with details only after further investigation.
