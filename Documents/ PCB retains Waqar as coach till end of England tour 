The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to retain Waqar Younis as head coach for the full tour of England this year although his two-year coaching contract expires in June.PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said that Waqar would continue as head coach for the full England tour, which begins in early July and continues till September.“There is no reason to change Waqar or the coaching staff and we will only review their performances and contracts after the England tour,” Khan told PTI on Wednesday.Waqar joined the Pakistan team for a second stint as coach in June 2014 after earlier having resigned himself in 2011 after an 18-month stint.Khan said that although Waqar’s contract expired in June but he had been told he would continue for the full England tour which includes tests, ODIs and T20 matches.“The England tour is an important one for us especially since we will be going there for the first time after the infamous 2010 spot fixing scandal,” Khan said.He said this is why he had asked Misbah-ul-Haq to continue as captain for the tour.“I had a chat with him and he indicated he would not retire now. But he is yet to agree formally,” Khan added.Misbah retired from ODIs after last year’s World Cup and has indicated he wants to retire from Tests as well but stalled the decision after the series against England.“We want Misbah to continue as captain because he is a dependable, stable and sensible captain and he can handle pressure and maintain discipline in team. We know the tour to England will not be easy because off the spot fixing scandal. And with Amir back in the side this is why we want Misbah to continue as captain.”Khan said that he had already informed Muhammad Amir and other players they should be prepared for a hard time when they go on tour.“But with time we are sure things will die down and people and media will than focus on the team’s performance,” he added.
