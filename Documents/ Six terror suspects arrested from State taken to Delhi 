The National Investigation Agency (NIA) that secured four-day in-transit custody of the six terror suspects they arrested from Karnataka, shifted all of them to New Delhi on Sunday morning.The six suspects were put up at an undisclosed location here and the police were given access to question them on Saturday.On Sunday morning, the six men were each escorted by a special NIA team and taken to New Delhi on separate commercial flights from Kempegowda International Airport. This was to prevent any untoward incident of the six men resorting to any mischief mid-air, sources said, and added that Directorate General of Civil Aviation norms do not allow more than one arrested person on a flight.Meanwhile, NIA sleuths clarified that Javed Rafeeq, who stabbed a constable here while trying to resist his arrest on Saturday evening, was not linked to the crackdown on IS-linked suspects.Sources confirmed that Rafeeq was a member of Indian Mujahideen (IM) module that carried out the Ahmedabad–Surat terror attacks in 2008 and had been absconding since then. He had recently become active on social media, which led the police to him, sources said.The constable, Srinivas, injured in the incident is recovering. Based on his complaint, the police booked Rafeeq and his wife Yasmeen Banu on the charge of assault. The two were produced before a magistrate in his house in Koramangala on Saturday night, who remanded them in 15-day police custody.Rafeeq, who had swallowed a pebble in a bid to commit suicide, is undergoing treatment. He was taken to the magistrate’s house from the hospital bed and brought back later, sources said.
