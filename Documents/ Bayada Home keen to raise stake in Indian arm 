New Jersey-based Bayada Home Health Care is keen on increasing its stake in the Chennai-based India Home Health Care to achieve its objective of serving at least one million patients a year globally.Talking to The Hindu, Bayada Home Health Care President, J. Mark Baiada, said: “Our aim is to serve globally at least one million patients per year covering pediatrics, geriatric and critical care. It is a long time goal and we are trying to hit the number by acquiring agencies and setting up joint ventures in different parts of the globe.”To achieve its objective, Bayada would increase its equity in the Chennai-based India Home Health Care Pvt. Ltd., in which it already holds 25.1 per cent stake.“Compared with the U.S., the Indian market is still in its infancy. But it is growing. We are here to support India Home Health Care by providing training and necessary support,” he said.On Monday, Bayada acquired Cologne-based Ulrich Home Health Care in all cash deal. It also entered into a joint venture with an unnamed South Korean firm to address the demand in geriatric care space. It is also exploring the possibility of entering Dublin, he said.During 2015, Bayada Home Health Care served 1.50 lakh patients based in the U.S. and India.This year, it might see an incremental increase of another ten per cent and reach three-lakh mark by 2018 after the acquisitions are completed, Mr. Baiada said.India Home Health Care President Anitha Arockiasamy said two training centres were being established in Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram to render international quality of service.
