n a bid to eliminate the arduous long wait in the queue lines and facilitate easier payment of electricity bills, the Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (APSPDCL) has introduced two new Any Time Payment (ATP) machines in Tirupati.These kiosks, which runs on the line of cash deposit machines installed in banks, will accept payment from consumers and generate bills for availing the services.For the past one year, the discom officials have monitored consumers’ response to the ATP machine installed on the premises of the DE office on the Old Tiruchanur Road.Buoyed by the feedback, two more ATP machines have been set up in Balaji Colony and at Leelamahal Circle, which happen to be among the busiest centres in the temple city.According to officials, the machine, which works with a touch-screen interface round-the-clock, is easy to operate.Consumers have to select the bill payment option, enter service numbers, check their credentials, place the required money or cheque in the slot and collect their final statement. The bill amount will be rounded off and excess money will be adjusted in the next bill cycle.We are in talks with the consultants to fix all issues. We will increase the number of ATPs in the districts falling under the discom’s purview.- An official of APSPDCL
