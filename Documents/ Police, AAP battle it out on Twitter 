A tweet about a protest from the Delhi Police’s official handle on Wednesday left the Aam Aadmi Party irked. Quite active on the social networking website for the past few weeks, the @DelhiPolice had tweeted about a salary-related protest scheduled for 11 a.m. at Civil Lines.“Today at 11am over 2,000 MCD teachers, doctors & pensioners will protest against non-release of their 3-month salary at Civil Lines. (sic),” read the tweet.‘Details’ of the ‘routine’ tweet immediately caught the eyes of some AAP leaders and supporters, who alleged that it appeared as if the Delhi Police themselves were organising the protest. Senior party leader Dilip Pandey led a host of supporters who took to Twitter to allege that the post showed how the police was working against the AAP government.The police soon responded by pointing out that they issue an alert for “any gathering above 1,000 people to prevent traffic hassles”. “We hope you appreciate the objective,” the police added in the tweet.
