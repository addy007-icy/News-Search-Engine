The Madras High Court on Monday ordered notices to the Chief Election Commissioner of India and the chairman of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on a plea that objected to the use of waste plastic for making political flags and banners.When the plea filed by A.P. Suryaprakasam came up for hearing, the First Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M. Sathyanarayanan directed the respondents to take up the issue as to what order can be passed to prevent waste plastic from affecting the State. The Bench later posted the matter to March 1.The petitioner submitted that the Assembly polls was due this year and political parties were “as usual” going to pollute the atmosphere by the “reckless” use of tonnes of cheap and non-biodegradable flags and banners made of plastic, which could be more than 500 tonnes.Referring to his representation to the authorities concerned seeking to ban the usage of plastic bags and harmful chemicals by political parties and candidates in the coming polls, he claimed there was no action on his representation.Hence, the plea seeking to bar political parties from using plastic flags and banners and disqualify them from contesting in the 2016 Assembly polls.
