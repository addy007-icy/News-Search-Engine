The 203rd edition of the Lalbagh Flower Show has, in a first, used only potted plants and flowers grown on ground from saplings.This is new ground for Lalbagh, which has held flower shows for more than a century by using lakhs of cut flowers. This year, the Horticulture Department decided to get rid of the protracted and laborious process of handling cut flowers that were used to create floral replicas at the Glass House every year. Cut flowers were used at several places in Lalbagh for visual designing, which involved sourcing nearly 5 lakh of them for every show.“Last year, the replica of Bangalore Palace had 2 lakh Dutch roses sourced from five companies, and 95 per cent of them had to be replaced with fresh ones as they dry up in five days,” said M. Jagadeesh, joint director, Horticulture, Parks and Gardens, Lalbagh.“Realising that there wasn’t any economic or eco-sense in repeating this, we tried replacing cut flowers with fresh plants in pots. Even the replica of Krumbiegel’s home this year has been done with potted plants,” he said.After the show wraps up on Tuesday, the department will be left with 70 per cent of the potted varieties with seasonal flowering that will continue to blossom for the next three months. “This way, we need not tackle dry and wet waste, which we used to do with 4 lakh dry roses after each show,” said Mr. Jagadeesh.The show will generate five truckloads of biowaste comprising dry flowers, twigs and foliage gathered from around the garden. The biodegradable waste is generally handled by Lalbagh authorities for systematic composting, a portion of which is also sent to Hulimavu Bio Centre at Bannerghatta Road for converting into vermi-compost.Lalbagh generates two truckloads of bio-waste and one truck of litter every week. There are 300 bins placed at vantage points, with nearly 40 volunteers educating visitors and vendors on the use of bins.
