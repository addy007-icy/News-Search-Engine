Even as the Union Cabinet has approved the closure of HMT Watch Factory and offered voluntary retirement scheme to its staff as per the 2007 pay scales, NITI Aayog member Vijay Kumar Saraswat on Thursday visited HMT Machine Tools Ltd., Bengaluru Complex. In the visitor’s book, Dr. Saraswat wrote: “Time has come to revive the old HMT spirit to make a mark in emerging global market. You have done well, you have the capability. Revive your spirit and have confidence. You will have the rightful place. Wish you all the best…HMT had done exceedingly well in keeping the machine tool industry (being competitive) going. There is a need to now leapfrog into the next phase of smart, intelligent and additive manufacturing under our programme of ‘Make in India’, an HMT release quoted.
