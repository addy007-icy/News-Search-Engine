Weeks after the ruling Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh sacked a senior advisor-cum-minister for urging Muslims to participate in “Karseva,” a party MLC has now promised to donate Rs 10 lakh and a gold crown for a temple at the disputed site.Senior leader Bukkal Nawab while daring the BJP to construct a Ram temple in Ayodhya said that though the matter was in Court, the BJP was busy announcing dates for the construction of a temple.“The BJP is politicising the issue and misleading people. It held power both at the Centre and State but did nothing. It is not their intention to build a Ram temple. I challenge them to start construction for a Temple and I will donate Rs 10 lakh and a gold crown,” Mr. Nawab said.The SP, however, downplayed Mr. Nawab’s comments. “It’s a good thing if Mr. Nawab gets the temple constructed. But he has not specified where the temple will be constructed,” said SP Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav.
