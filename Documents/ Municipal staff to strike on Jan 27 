Various unions representing municipal workers came together on Saturday and announced that they would go on strike on January 27 to demand that their salaries be paid.The Capital’s municipal corporations, particularly the North and East Delhi civic bodies, have been unable to pay salaries on time for a year now. At present, they owe their workers wages for four months.The BJP-led corporations have all but put their hands up, saying they haven’t received funds from the Delhi government.Even as the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party continue to blame each other, the 1.5 lakh employees of the three corporations plan to intensify their stir.The workers’ unions with allegiance to different political parties have been carrying out parallel protests for months, but have now decided to come together.“We have decided to combine our efforts because enough is enough. Workers are finding it difficult to put food on the table, so we will be escalating our protest,” said Sanjay Gehlot, president of the Swatantra Mazdoor Vikas Sanyukt Morcha.
