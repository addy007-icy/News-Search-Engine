Police have booked a woman, who had ‘armed’ her daughter, allegedly to stab her teacher at Municipal Girls’ Higher Secondary School here on January 8, on a charge of abusing the teacher.The girl, studying Class VI, was caught carrying a “uli” (a sharp-edged chisel-like tool) to school and enquiries revealed that her mother had given her the weapon, allegedly to stab the Tamil teacher for admonishing her for leaving the school during lunch break without permission and coming late, police said.Though this was a serious offence, police, considering the future of the girl and the fact that the woman, mother of three daughters, was separated from her husband a year ago, booked her under Sections 294 (b) (uttering obscene words in public place) and 506 (I) (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code.The police detained the woman and brought her to the Kenikarai police station on January 9 and let her off after an enquiry. As the offences were bailable in nature, she was released on bail, the police said.
