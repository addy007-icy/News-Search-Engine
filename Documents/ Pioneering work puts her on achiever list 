Seeking ways to address her son’s learning disability, Sandhya Prajin, rather hesitantly, decided to establish a school exclusively for dyslexic children, one-and-a-half years ago. Thus came into being Travancore National School, possibly the first school in the city for children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).The initiative paved the way for her entry into the list of ‘100 women achievers of India’ released by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The #100Women contest was launched by the Ministry in collaboration with Facebook to reward the contributions of women who strive to make an impact on people around them. Sandhya will be among those who will be felicitated by President Pranab Mukherjee at a lunch to be organised at Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 22.Sandhya’s son, Tejas, was branded a slow-learner, despite being naturally gifted in various aspects.The school was launched in June 2014 and within a year, was upgraded to Class 12. Students from the institute have passed their Class 10 examinations through the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). The school, which functions from a rented facility in Sasthamangalam, currently has 40 students who are being taught by trained teachers.
