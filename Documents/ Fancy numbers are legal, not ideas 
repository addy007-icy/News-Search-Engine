A bat in flight mode; a revolver shooting off that legendary James Bond number 007 – these are some of the fancies that take wings in the number plates bearing the registration number of vehicles.Better stop these and such other ‘improvisations’ since they are in complete violation of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules 50 and 51, warns the Motor Vehicles Department. Else, be ready to cough up fine.The department is in the hunt for those guilty of using number plates according to their whims and fancies with scant regard for the rules. In fact, the rules specify the exact size of number plates to be used according to which two and three wheelers should sport 200 x 100 mm boards, light motor vehicles/passenger cars 340 x 200 mm or 500 x 120 mm and medium or heavy commercial vehicles should have 340 x 200 mm plates.Even the height, thickness and space between letters and numerals of registration marks for different classes of vehicles, and that too separately for front and rear, have also been laid down.“The registration number not displayed as per the rules prescribed can be considered invalid. The number plates should not display anything other than the registration number. Advertisements of automobile dealers and even declaration of government vehicles found on some plates are illegal,” said Motor Vehicle Inspector Shefiq B.The department now slaps a fine of Rs.2,000 for violation of rules with regard to registration of number plates in the case of non-commercial vehicles, Rs.3,000 and Rs.4,000 for commercial light motor vehicles and medium commercial vehicles and Rs.5,000 for heavy vehicles.A fake banMotorists passing along the Bund Road connecting Chilavannoor and Thykoodam would have by now noticed a graffiti at a point where the road shrunk as it approaches Thykoodam.On a portion of a wall over a fresh coat of paint appears an ‘order’ banning entry of four wheelers. The graffiti gives the impression that it comes straight from the traffic police.Only, the police are unaware of any such restriction on the Bund Road.Then came the confession by a local resident that it was indeed done by some people in the locality to bring down the number of vehicles jostling for space on the road.But the ploy seems to have failed with motorists giving scant regard to the ban.
