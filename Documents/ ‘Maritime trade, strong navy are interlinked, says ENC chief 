And when it comes to natural resources, South Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal are rich areas, we need to have a strong navy to defend our waters. “The future is blue economy and a strong blue water force is the need of the hour,” he said.Referring to a question on whether the Indian Navy was a blue water force, Admiral Soni said that it was.On leadership skills, the Admiral pointed out that a leader was a person who has the ability to work hard and the ability to make others work hard.Stressing on imbibing values, Admiral Soni advised the budding management graduates not to look primarily towards CTC or salary packages.Success can in life is not to be measured by how much you earn, but by what you have contributed to society, he said.On the upcoming International Fleet Review he said that it was an event to be watched, as 52 countries will be participating.
