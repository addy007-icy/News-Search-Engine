District Collector Biju Prabhakar, who is also the chairman of the Regional Transport Authority, has warned strict action against those who were found to be responsible for misuse of bus permits issued under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe category.Speaking at a meeting organised by the authority to renew permits, Mr. Prabhakar said that the ongoing exercise would be undertaken only after close scrutiny of documents.He said that the facility had been put in place for the benefit of those hailing from such sections.The permits and the buses must be registered in the names of those belonging to the scheduled sections.The employees must also come under the particular category, he said.He added that a proposal to maintain a register was being seriously considered in order to ensure that KSRTC and private buses that have been issued permits to Kudappanakunnu ply services until the Civil Station. The Collector also said that attempts made by private bus operators to digress from their usual routes would be viewed in a serious manner.City Police Commissioner G. Sparjan Kumar and private bus operatorsâ€™ representatives also participated in the meeting.
