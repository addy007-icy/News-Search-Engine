With the board exams of classes X and XII fast approaching and cut off marks becoming the deciding factor for students for entry into colleges of their choice, private tuition centres in the city also upgrade and use technology to help students.Sasikumar, who teaches mathematics at Bright Tuition Centre at Saibaba Colony, says that the portions of class XII have been completed and the revision is on now.“Out of over 200 students who approach us, we select around 150 based on their previous year annual examination marks. We start the coaching of the syllabus of class XII when the students are halfway through their class XI. We have different types of teaching aids like projectors to show three dimensional pictures of cylinders and cones and the binding charts which explain the concepts,” he says. In addition, the students take 20 full portion tests, apart from the unit tests which are conducted every week.Santhosh, a staff at Brilliant Academy says, “We pay individual attention to every student. Students participate in mind games apart from the regular classes. We approach the concepts with practical methods of teaching. For instance, we dissect the specimen of flowers to teach the internal parts of it.”A. Ramu of Ram Tuition Centre, Ganapathy says that students usually attend classes for two hours a day on week days and three hours on Sundays and there are extra classes for those who find it difficult to pick up.The teachers say that the questions will be set tough this year as everyone scores high in the board examinations and the portions are almost completed in school.
