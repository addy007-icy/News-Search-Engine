At the Putharikandam grounds on Sunday afternoon, the travails of transgenders who are forced to leave the land of their birth and move elsewhere to make a life came alive on stage during the group dance high school event.The subjects are increasingly contemporary. Tarif, who has been training teams for the past 18 years, said there was a constant effort to take up new themes. Under him, the team from Alappuzha depicted the travails of transgenders. This is not the first time that Tarif has taken up a social theme. He has earlier presented on stage the woes of women who seek alms.Shibu Shankar and Anwar Edakkara, who trained the two Malappuram teams, chose to weave their narrative around the four apsaras â€“ Urvashi, Rambha, Menaka, and Tilottama, their beauty, and their jealousies.Sunil Sharangan of Kollam, who trained the Kottarakara Girls Mar Thomas Girls High School team, to their first State-level event said tribal dances and even those based on Oppari were being performed on stage. Western dance-inspired movements, including the Russian ballet style, were being seen.But this bid to appeal to changing audience sensibilities comes at a price, a steep one.Shibu and Anwar said live orchestra was discontinued owing to the expenditure incurred. Today, however, the maximum expenditure was being incurred on costumes and the props used on stage. This ran into lakhs.A single student, they said, would have to shell up to Rs.1.3 lakh for the fete. This included the expenses for costume, training, music, and so on.The team from Kanikyamatha Convent English Medium School, Palakkad, said changes were also made, if need be, to costumes and make-up during the period from the school-level fete to that at the State level.The bid to appeal to changing audience sensibilities comes at a price,a steep one.
