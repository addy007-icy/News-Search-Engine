Due to a technical problem, trial run of Chennai Metro Rail trains between Little Mount and Nanganallur Road has been suspended.According to officials of CMRL, the trial run, which started in October-end, could not be continued for want of an important software. “We have asked Siemens, the contractor, to provide us with the software soon; but it is not clear when it will be installed. Only after it is done will we be able to continue the trial run of trains on the new stretch,” an official said.The next stretch of Chennai Metro Rail from Little Mount to Nanganallur Road may be commissioned in about six months. Though officials say this disruption of trial run will not affect the deadline, sources say it is likely to delay the process. The track work was completed sometime ago and it was decided to start the trial run. Now effort is on to complete the remaining work.
