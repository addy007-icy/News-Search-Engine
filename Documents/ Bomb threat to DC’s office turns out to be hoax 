With the word spreading, the employees and visitors began making a hasty exit from the more than century old building housing the DC’s office.After a thorough check of the building, the police declared that it was a hoax call and allowed the officials and the public to enter the premises. “After evacuating the building, we carried out a through check and found that it was a hoax call”, said Assistant Commissioner of Police, Krishnaraja Division, Mallik.Meanwhile, the call had been traced to a Public Call Office (PCO) in K R Mohalla. The caller, who spoke in Kannada, also warned that a bomb will be kept on the premises of the court. The caller also said that the bomb was being made at a house in Nanjumalige in the city.“The caller was claiming to have overheard people conspiring to place the bombs”, said a police officer.City Police Commissioner B.
