: For the second time this month, employees of the municipal corporations of Delhi will go on strike to protest the delay in payment of their salaries.The cash-strapped North and East Delhi civic bodies have been unable to pay salaries to workers for three to four months now.Though the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) claims that sanitation workers have been paid their wages for December, employees’ unions maintain that most of the staff hasn’t got salaries for the month of October.Sanitation workers, doctors, teachers, engineers and office staff of the corporations will strike on Wednesday and hold a protest at Jantar Mantar — like they did on January 14.Some workers of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which is so far unaffected by the cash-crunch, will join the protesters to show solidarity.“Not only will we be protesting the delay in salaries, but we will also be demanding the reunification of the three corporations. Ever since the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was split into three, the finances have suffered,” said Rajendra Mewati, the general secretary of the United Front of MCD Employees.The workers have also planned a protest outside Avind Kejriwal’s residence. The BJP-led corporations have maintained that their ongoing financial crisis is because the Delhi government has withheld funds. The corporations claim the government owes them Rs.3,000 crore in total, whereas the Chief Minister said on Monday that there were no outstanding payments.Protests are being planned at all corporation offices over the coming month against the delayed salaries.
