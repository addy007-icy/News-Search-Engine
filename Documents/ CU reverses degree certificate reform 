The University of Calicut has reversed the system of dispatching degree certificates from the Vice-Chancellor’s office.A reform introduced by former Vice Chancellor M. Abdul Salam to speed up the certificate dispatch process by bypassing several sections had evoked severe criticism from the academic community after errors began to creep into the certificates.Vice Chancellor K. Mohammed Basheer, who took charge a few weeks ago, decided to do away with his predecessor’s certificate reform by taking into confidence all sections of employees. The employees belonging to different unions supported Dr. Basheer’s move, and they offered him cooperation to speed up certificate issuance even while maintaining extreme vigil against mistakes.The new system will have the certificates going back to sections concerned and will be verified by section officers and deputy registrars. “We are restoring the old system. It will definitely minimize the chances of errors,” said a senior official at Pareeksha Bhavan.
