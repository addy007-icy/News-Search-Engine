As part of the ongoing Chennai Pongal Book Festival organised by Tamil Books Sales Promotion Association, lifetime achievement awards were conferred on writer Ponneelan, lexiconist P.R. Subramanian and poet Sella Ganapathy for their contribution to Tamil writing. N. Ram, Chairman, Kasturi & Sons Limited, gave away the awards on Thursday evening.Mr. Ram said that the selfless achievements of the awardees would be truly honoured only if a stance was taken in defence of the freedom of speech and expression.“In our country, this has increasingly come under attack and writers need to expand frontiers by writing about what is not spoken about,” he said. Mr. Ram said the fact that many still did not know how to read the language proved to be a challenge to the development of the language and literature.V. Arasu, former professor of Tamil literature, delivered the presidential address and highlighted the achievements of the writers. As part of the book festival, the Tamil Books Sales Promotion Association will also honour seven writers from various genres of Tamil literature.
