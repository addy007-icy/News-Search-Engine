A week after two sisters were allegedly molested and their father allegedly beaten up by unidentified motorcycle-borne men in Vasant Kunj, the ‘Villain Is Back’ stickers on their two-wheeler helped arrest the suspects.Despite the alleged abusers leaving behind their motorcycle while fleeing in the face of a gathering public, police had trouble tracking them as the vehicle was found to be a stolen one.The accused, both aged 22 years, lived in South Delhi’s Mehrauli area and were using the stolen motorcycle by displaying a fake number plate, said Prem Nath, DCP (South).The molestation incident had occurred on Kishangarh Road in Vasant Kunj on the night of December 29. Having had their dinner, the two sisters, aged 17 and 19, had gone for stroll with their father.As they were walking, the two motorcycle-borne men passed lewd comments at them. When the girls’ father stood up against the abusers, he was physically assaulted and left to bleed. Even the two girls were physically molested and beaten when they tried to save their father.The girls and their father found support from some locals who rushed to their aid. Finding themselves cornered, the youths fled the spot, leaving their red Pulsar motorcycle behind.Stickers that read ‘Villain Is Back’ were found on the front and rear of the motorcycle. Police registered a case and began tracing the owner of the motorcycle only to realise it was a fake number plate.Based on the engine and chassis number of the vehicle, they finally traced the owner, only to realise that that someone had stolen his motorcycle in Hauz Rani area in September.“An intensive search was conducted in areas like Mehrauli, Vasant Kunj and Vasant Vihar. The beat staff conducted door-to-door search in these areas in a bid to identify who rode the motorcycle with ‘Villain is Back’ written on it,” said the DCP.Their efforts paid off as they received a tip-off on Sunday about the presence of the two suspects in Mehrauli. The duo was arrested.
