Despite the death of seven people, including an elderly person, due to the cold in the last two days, the State government seems to have done little to take stock of the situation.With the winter chill finally setting in the Capital, the homeless are the worst affected in the absence of proper shelter homes. According to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), there are 246 night shelters in the city, but what the city lacks is shelters especially designated for the elderly.“Seven homeless people have died in the Capital in the last two days despite the Delhi government claiming that they have a capacity to house 18,000 people on a daily basis. The reality is far from what the government claims. The space that they claim can house 18,000 people can actually house just half of it,” said Sunil Kumar Aledia from the Centre for Holistic Development.“They should wake up to the real issues and try to cater to people in a more realistic way, especially the homeless elderly. While the government has a few designated shelters for women, there are none for the elderly. They have special needs which should be catered to,” Mr. Aledia added.A DUSIB official said: “From January 11 to 17 more than 9,000 homeless people slept inside the shelter homes every night. We have to look into the reason of the death of the seven homeless people whose bodies were found and whether they actually died of cold.”The Bharatiya Janata Party too has raised the issue. Addressing a press conference, a BJP leader said that the silence of the Delhi government spoke volumes. He added that what is more surprising is the silence of Delhi MLA Alka Lamba in whose constituency several people had died.The DUSIB has so far received a total of 366 complaints on its mobile app for homeless people in distress.
