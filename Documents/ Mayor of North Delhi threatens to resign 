The Mayor of North Delhi challenged the Aam Aadmi Party government on Thursday to prove that it did not owe the civic bodies any money.In fact, the Mayor offered to resign if that was the case.Ravinder Gupta, Mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, was speaking at the Civic Centre after being confronted by employees who have been on strike since Wednesday over delayed salaries.Mr. Gupta said the AAP and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had been saying that the government had cleared all dues to the corporations.“That is not true at all. I challenge Mr. Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to come to Ramlila Maidan and present proof that they do not owe the corporations anything. If they can do it, I will resign,” said Mr. Gupta.The Mayor was referring to a rally in Ramlila Maidan last year when the Chief Minister addressed municipal workers, who were on strike at that time too.Mr. Kejriwal had then told the crowd that the government was not to be blamed for the financial crisis the corporations were facing.
