Many families who are being shifted from Thideer Nagar along the Adyar river in Saidapet, barely know anything of the city outside their locality. A. Kadhar, a 51-year-old resident running a small business, says the area where he has lived all his life is the only world he knows.“People are slowly being shifted to Thoraipakkam to government flats. Three generations of my family has been calling this place our home and now, all of a sudden, things are changing,” he says. “If the government were to build us concrete homes on an elevated place in the surrounding area, we believe it will be of more help,” he adds.The locality along the Adyar river, below Maraimalai Adigal bridge, is now nothing but a sight of broken houses, children playing in sewage, livestock lazing in the muck and heaps of garbage.“We have four government schools, hospitals, bus stand and a railway station nearby. We are not very sure if we will have the same kind of connectivity in Thoraipakkam too,” says A. Punitha, who lives in the area.Students worriedFor schools students, moving will be a very difficult experience. “We are getting better homes and bus passes. But next year, we will be enrolled in new schools. This will be particularly difficult as we will have to adjust to new and unfamiliar surroundings,” said S. Thamarai Selvi, a class VIII student.Many residents feelit would have been better had the government builtflats near Saidapet
