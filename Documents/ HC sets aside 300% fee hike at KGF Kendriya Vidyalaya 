In a relief to a section of parents, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday set aside the 300 per cent hike for non-BEML category of students of the Kendriya Vidyalaya in BEML Nagar of KGF.Justice A.S. Bopanna passed the order while disposing a petition filed by KV Parents’ Association, KGF questioning the increase in tuition fee for non-BEML category students from Rs. 600 per month to Rs. 2,100 per month with effect from March 26, 2014.“…the quantum of the increase made in the fee does not justify the reason for which it was done due to lack of application of mind…,” the court observed while asking the KV Management Committee and BEML to redo the fee hike process taking aspects, including financial background of parents of non-BEML wards, that were not considered prior to issuance of the March 26, 2014 notification.However, the court held that the KV at BEML can have a differential fee structure for non-BEML category students and refused to accept the contention of the Association that a differential fee structure would amount to discrimination.The fee of Rs. 600 per month has been in force since 1982. The KV management and BEML, which has sponsored the school, had decided to increase the fee for non-BEML students to meet expenses like the salary for teachers.Referring to non-increase of fee for 30 years as a reason for the steep hike, the court said only present students should not bear the brunt of a sudden hike.Though the court said that a ‘gradual increase in fee is acceptable’, it found that the explanation offered by the KV gives an impression that the fee collected from non-BEML wards is used for subsidising fees of BEML wards. “Also, an assessment of the financial status of students in the non-BEML wards category is required…” the court said while directing authorities to undertake a fresh process to hike the fee.
