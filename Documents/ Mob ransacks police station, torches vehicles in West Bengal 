A mob on Friday ransacked a police station, set two police vehicles on fire and allegedly assaulted constables after a man was crushed to death by a truck carrying sand in Birbhum district.The man was crushed to death while crossing Mayerswar-Rampurhat road at Mayureswar on Friday morning, Birbhum Superintendent of Police Mukesh Kumar said.As the news spread, a large number of villagers gathered at the spot and claimed that the man was riding a motorcycle and was hit by the truck, which was loaded with sand from Mayureswar river, as it was being chased by a police vehicle allegedly to collect money from the driver.Police, however, rejected the claim of the villagers.When the forces reached the area and tried to take away the body, the mob threw stones at them and set fire to the two vehicles, Mr. Kumar said.The policemen chased by the mob ran to Mayureswar police station, which was nearby, to save themselves.The mob then forcibly entered the police station and went on the rampage and ransacked a room, Mr. Kumar added.Eyewitness, however, said the mob assaulted policemen on duty at the police station.A large police force was rushed in from Rampurhat and Suri, who brought the situation under control and removed the body after about six hours since the accident.
