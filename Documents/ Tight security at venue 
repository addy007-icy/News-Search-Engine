Two patrolling vehicles too were pressed into service to prevent untoward incidents.The participants, including senior writers, entering the auditorium were frisked by the policemen at the entrance and metal detectors too were used to check bags.As the event was dedicated to the slain writer M.M. Kalburgi, who had been a member of the steering committee, a session on alleged intolerance in society was incorporated among the literary sessions. Arrangements were also made to ensure that no untoward incident took place when the sessions were on.
