The work of institutions run by Christian missionaries for the welfare of the oppressed and those who are in difficulty has had a lasting impact on society, and this needs to be appreciated, Home Minister G. Parameshwara has said.Speaking at a function to present Sandesha Awards here on Saturday, he said that development would not have any meaning if a section of the society remained oppressed and was denied its benefits. Mr. Parasmeshwara said that institutions run by Christian missionaries were selflessly working for the welfare and betterment of the oppressed sections of society.“I am not concerned about the comments being made against institutions, which have remained committed to the cause of development of the oppressed and needy sections of society.”Institutions such as Sandesha Foundation had involved themselves in development of literature, art and culture that had helped cement bonds among communities and foster harmonious living.Earlier, Mr. Parameshwara and Archbishop Bernard Moras presented Sandesha Awards to eight persons. They included writer H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, Konkani writer Glady Rego, Tulu actor and theatre artist Devadas Kapikad, sitar player Ustad Rafique Khan, teacher Sugantha Sathiaraj from Ballari and musician Joel Pereira. Sandesha special recognition award was given to G.S. Jayadeva from Deenabhandu Trust in Chamarajanagar.Mr. Jayadeva expressed concern over the youth going away from culture. It was necessary to involve the youth in cultural activities to take them away from matters that cause tension among communities.“We need to spearhead the message of love that cements people from different communities,” he said.
