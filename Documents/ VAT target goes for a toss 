The Aam Aadmi Party government’s ambitious plan to increase VAT collection by more than 31 per cent in 2015-16 seems to have fallen flat.In nine months this financial year, the Trade and Taxes Department has managed to collect only Rs.14,730 crore or just 61 per cent of the Rs.24,000-crore target. Senior VAT officials feel it is unlikely that they will be able to achieve their target in the next three months.Sources in the Department said the government is likely to bring down the target to Rs.20,000 crore since the earlier estimate was too high. “We are trying our best, but the Rs.24,000 crore target is tough to achieve,” said a senior VAT officer. The reduction in tax collection is likely to affect development works, as VAT constitutes 69.2 per cent of the projected tax revenue.In its maiden Budget, the Delhi government had increased the target of VAT collection from Rs.18,550 crore in 2014-15 to Rs.24,000 crore, despite experts and opposition parties questioning the move. Interestingly, the yearly growth of VAT collection in 2014-15 was just two per cent more than the 2013-14 collection. From Rs.17,925 crore in 2013-14, it rose to just Rs.18,289 in 2014-15“But targets are always ambitious — both revenue and expenditure. Even the Centre doesn’t achieve its targets,” added an official.Explaining the reason behind slow VAT collection, officials said India’s economic growth has an impact on VAT collection. With a slump in the real estate sector, collections from big industries like cement have seen a dip.“With an increase in the global oil prices, revenue from fuel hasn’t been as expected.”However, Opposition leaders said the present government had drastically increased the education and health budget based on increased revenue collection. “But if the Department cannot generate the estimated income, then their big promises will fall flat,” said the Leader of the Opposition Vijender Gupta.The Delhi government had in July increased the VAT on petrol from 20 per cent to 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent to 16.6 per cent on diesel, thereby resulting in an increase in the price of petrol by Rs.2.78 per litre and Rs.1.83 per litre in the case of diesel. “The loss is not just of Rs.4,000 crore, even if they achieve Rs.20,000 crore, it is more as they are getting around Rs.3,000 crore more from the recently hiked VAT on petrol and diesel. It shows the failure of this government,” added Mr Gupta.“They have just collected Rs.14,730 crore till date. How can they collect Rs.9,000 crore in just three months?” he asked.To boost the revenue and meet the target, the department had started raiding the eateries and used spy cameras.Heavy penalties were imposed and to bring in transparency in the collection process, the department integrated their system with some eateries. “VAT is not only the source of income for the government. There is excise department and registration fee and stamp duty,” said the official.Trade and taxes department will receive Rs. 1600 as Central Sales Tax (CST) compensation from the Centre. “But it will not be enough to achieve the target,” said the official. Earlier the Centre used to give 4 per cent of the total CST but they reduced it to 2 per cent.
