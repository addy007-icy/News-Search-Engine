Lt. Col. Niranjan E. Kumar was even an inspiration for his elder brother to join the armed forces, said Shankar Jadhav, National Cadet Corps (NCC) teacher to the brothers in late 1990s.“Though Sharath Kumar is the elder of the two brothers, it was Niranjan who was very passionate about joining the Army from a very young age and was commissioned in 2004 much ahead of his brother. Sharath then joined the Air Force,” Mr. Jadhav said.Mr. Jadhav, who trained Lt. Col. Niranjan Kumar in the NCC from 1997 to 1999 at BEL College, Jalahalli, said, “One distinct thing that marked Niranjan was he loved his uniform and was very passionate.” He recalled that Lt. Col. Niranjan Kumar was very active and adventurous.
