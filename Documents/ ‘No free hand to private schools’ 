Though private unaided schools in the Capital enjoy institutional autonomy, they cannot get “absolute free hands” when it comes to admissions and the State can step in if they misuse autonomy, the Delhi government said on Thursday. The government could issue directions for maintenance of standards, it was contended.Defending a recent order scrapping 62 criteria, including management quota, for nursery admissions, the counsel for the Delhi government told the High Court that it had only asked private schools to adopt criteria that are fair and reasonable. No new reference points were laid down, he said.The Bench of Justice Manmohan was hearing arguments on the writ petitions moved by the Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which challenged the Delhi government’s decision.The petitioners contended that the decision was “arbitrary and whimsical” and would impact the autonomy of private schools to regulate admissions.The court observed that the practice of taking policy decisions by way of circulars or office orders, passed without statutory backing, would create inconsistencies in the government’s functioning, as there could be new circulars every day.The arguments in the case will continue on Friday.
