The Himachal Pradesh Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has openly come out in support of the >India-Pakistan T20 international match slated to be held at Dharamsala on March 19, expressing surprise at the “parochial” approach of Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and > his party who have opposed the event in order to “not hurt the feelings of families of martyrs” from the hill State.“The relations with the neighbouring country should not be worsened by such behaviour of the State leaders. We are not in a state of war with Pakistan,” said CPI(M) leader Tikender Panwar, who has filed a writ petition against the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) for “undemocratic functioning.” The party also called for full security from the State agencies for players and support staff.Highlighting the “fraternal relations” with Pakistan, the Left party leaders said cricket ground was “not a battleground”, stressing that people of the two countries were not against one another. “For a handful of people who spread venom, efforts to establish good relations should not be abandoned,” a CPI (M) leader said.The party also warned the BJP and the Board of Cricket for Control in India Secretary Anurag Thakur against propagating anti-Pakistan sentiments in the country, saying the BJP and Congress leaders of Kangra district were “doing more harm than good” by stoking nationalistic feelings among the families of martyrs.
