AP State Government Contract and Outsourcing Employeesâ€™ Federation has asked the Sate government to continue the services of Gopala mitras in the State.Federation State president A.V. Nageswara Rao on Wednesday said that the government plans to remove 3,000 Gopala mitras across the State. The Gopala mitras had been working for nominal wages since 1999. The Gopala mitras had been discharging all kinds of duties, including first aid and artificial insemination of cattle, for the last 15 years. The government move to privatise the dairy sector and terminate the services of Gopala mitras was highly condemnable, he said.
