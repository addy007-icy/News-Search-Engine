Several people’s representatives of Itchapuram constituency region have strongly opposed establishment of multi-product industrial zone in Sompeta saying that it will affect the water bodies and disturb the livelihood of many residents. They said no industrial activity should be allowed in and around ‘Beela' since it would lead to many cascading affects in future.Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham on Wednesday held a crucial meeting with them to discuss about agro-based industries in the region. The meeting assumed significance as recently government scrapped GOs which enabled Nagarjuna Construction Company to establish thermal power plant. However, the project was shelved with the stiff opposition from locals and killing of three persons in police firing.The company, which bought lands from locals, approached the government to establish at least agro-based industries such as poultry, fisheries, corporate agriculture activity and dairy farm. The Collector reportedly proposed that 500 acres could be utilised for protection of water bodies and remaining can be utilised for industries which could provide employment to many people. He said that local leaders should accept it since it would ultimately benefit people living in and around the project.Rushigudda sarpanch Karri Kameswara Rao said that Beela area should not be touched at any cost. A few others representing other areas such as Baruva, Benkili, Palasapuram, and Janikibhadra told that the people might not cooperate with the district administration. The Collector said that it was the responsibility of the public representatives to convince local residents since industrial development was also necessary for development of the district.
