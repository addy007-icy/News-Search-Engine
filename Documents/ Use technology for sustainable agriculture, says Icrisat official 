Director General of ICRISAT, David J. Bergvinson, on Monday underscored the significance of deploying technology tools in agriculture.“Mechanisation can address just one of the many risks… to mitigate most of the risks faced by agriculture today, technology adoption is imperative,” he told a workshop on ‘Sustainable agriculture – harnessing technologies, harvesting prosperity’ organised here by FICCI.Counting remote sensing, drones/UAV, big data and analytics, digital soil maps, mobile money/digital wallets and plant sensors among technologies that could be disruptive in the sphere of agriculture, he called for more investments by government in the research.
