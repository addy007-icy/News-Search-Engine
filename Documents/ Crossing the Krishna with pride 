Over 200 swimmers of age groups ranging from five to 70, in both genders, took part in the annual river crossing competitions organised by Aqua Devils Welfare Association (ADWA) in river Krishna here on Tuesday.Being organised for the 16th time, the event witnessed swimmers from neighbouring districts such as West Godavari, Khammam and Guntur as well. “Owing to the flyover works at Durga Ghat, we decided to organise the event from our premises to Bhavani Islands, covering a distance of 1.5 km,” said Ramachandra Rao, president of the association.He said adequate precautions had been taken for the safety of swimmers by clearly demarcating the route with the help of colourful balloons.“We pressed into service professional swimmers armed with lifejackets on country boats, which followed the participants. Concentration was more on the junior segments,” he added.Life president and Narasapur Member of Parliament Gokaraju Ganga Raju, who was the chief guest, flagged off the events. He said hundreds of swimmers were produced from the association premises, and that they were are not only helping themselves escape from difficult situations but also saving others in distress. “Swimming adds confidence to your personality and enhances health,” he added.Meanwhile, the association members were a bit worried, as the land situated on the banks of Krishna has come under land pooling for capital formation. They are worried that the decades-long activity in popularising swimming might come to an end. “We have made a representation to Capital Region Development Authority’s to exempt the land as it was helping spread a good cause among people of all walks of life,” Mr. Rao said.Swimmers from across the State take part in the competitions, an annual affair
