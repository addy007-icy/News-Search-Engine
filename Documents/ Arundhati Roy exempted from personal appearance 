The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Monday granted exemption from personal appearance to noted writer Arundhati Roy in >a case of criminal contempt initiated by a single judge bench of the same court for publishing an article on the jailed Delhi University professor G.N. Saibaba.A division bench of Justice Bhushan Gavai and Justice P.N.Deshmukh adjourned the matter for four weeks and said that it would be heard again only after the Supreme Court decides on the plea of Ms.Roy.A single judge bench of Justice Arun Choudhary had issued a “criminal contempt of court” notice to Ms. Roy on December 23 last year on an intervention filed by advocate S.P.Bhandarkar for making “scandalous and scurrilous allegations” against the judiciary in an article published in the Outlook magazine in May 2015 and asked her to be present before the court.In a surprise move, High Court justice V.M.Deshpande recused himself from the matter against Ms. Roy on Monday morning.The case was then taken up in the court of Justice Gavai and Justice Deshmukh, who disagreed with Ms.Roy’s counsel K.H.Deshpande’s contention that a matter of criminal contempt could only be heard directly by the chief justice and not by any other judge.“Agreeing to your contention would in the negation of the article 215 of the constitution,” Justice Gavai told Mr.K.H. Deshpande.The division bench also refused to hear another intervention proposed by advocate Bhandarkar against Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan and asked him to file it after the Supreme Court decides on Ms.Roy’s application.The Supreme Court, last week, >sought a response from the Bombay High Court and the Maharashtra government after Ms. Roy argued that criminal contempt proceedings initiated against her amounted to choking dissent and produced an “intense chilling effect” on the fundamental right of free expression.
