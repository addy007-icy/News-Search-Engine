The authorities of the historic Sri Ramanathaswamy temple who were making arrangements for the ‘Kumbabishekam,’ being held after a gap of 14 years, heaved a sigh of relief as the Madurai bench of Madras High court cleared the decks for conducting the event, scheduled for January 20.The authorities, who had taken up the works on building ‘Parivara yaga salas’ on December 24, notwithstanding the pendency of two public interest litigations in the High Court against the conduct of the consecration on an ‘inauspicious day,’ almost completed the work for 108 ‘yaga gundams.’Final touches were being given to the ‘Parivara yaga salas’ and ‘pradana yaga salas,’ he said adding 47 ‘vediyal gundams’ and 61 other ‘yaga gundams’ would be performed for three days from January 16, S. Selvaraj, Joint Commissioner of the Temple said.All the works would be completed well in advance for the Vinayaga puja on January 15, he said.
