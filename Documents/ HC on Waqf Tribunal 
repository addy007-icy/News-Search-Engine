The Delhi High Court on Friday questioned the Aam Aadmi Party government about the setting up of the Waqf Tribunal in the Capital for litigation on Waqf properties, while seeking to know what action it had taken so far to establish the specialised adjudicatory body.The Delhi Waqf Board told a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, during the hearing on a public interest writ petition on the subject that it was unable to get as many as 990 Waqf properties vacated in the absence of the Waqf Tribunal.A large number of Waqf properties at prime locations in the Capital have been encroached upon during the past several decades.The court asked Delhi governmentâ€™s standing counsel Rahul Mehra to inform it about the latest situation on the establishment of Waqf Tribunal and posted the matter for further hearing on February 17.The Waqf Board had earlier informed the court through an affidavit that it had written three letters to the Delhi government for issuing a notification for setting up the tribunal, but nothing had been done so far.
