One of the major challenges in adapting the technology is that service utilities, like water sanitation pipelines and OFC cables, are under our roads, which lead too frequent digging and is one of the major culprits for the poor quality of carriageways. K.T. Nagaraj, Superintendent Engineer, Major Roads, BBMP said that adopting the technology would require shifting all such utilities under the footpath and providing service ducts like in TenderSURE roads. This will add to the cost.However, T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, Secretary, UDD, said that white-topped roads can also be dug up. “The concrete slabs have to be cut open and then cemented. It is more effective,” he said.
