Film-maker Suhaib Illyasi on Wednesday claimed that the music launch of his film Ghar Wapsi by ghazal singer Ghulam Ali scheduled in Mumbai on January 29 has been cancelled after there was no confirmation from Maharashtra government that it will provide security for the programme.Ali was invited by Mr. Illyasi to release the music of his film at The Club in Andheri. Mr. Illayasi told The Hindu, “Yes, the music launch has been cancelled. We had requested the BJP-led government to provide security, but as of now, there is no confirmation that security will be provided.”Mr. Illyasi says he had written to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking security for the music launch in the face of opposition by the Shiv Sena, which had last year forced the cancellation of a concert by Ghulam Ali in memory of ghazal singer Jagjit Singh.‘Under pressure’“The Club management informed us that they cannot give us the venue between 12 and 3 p.m. on January 29. We had booked and paid for the venue earlier, but now they say they cannot give us the venue. They have officially not given any official reason, but orally told me that they are under pressure from the Shiv Sena,” he said.
