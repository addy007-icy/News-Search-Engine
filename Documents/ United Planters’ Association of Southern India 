The United Planters’ Association of Southern India (UPASI), the apex body of planters in south India, has made a strong plea for “overhauling the archaic Plantations Labour Act (PLA), 1951” because such a step is an imperative to save the Rs.43,000-crore industry “now reeling under high taxation, unremunerative returns and commodity price fluctuation.”A statement from the planters said here on Wednesday that in a pre-budget memorandum to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, UPASI had demanded that until changes were made to the PLA, all expenses under this category be given weighted deduction to the extent of 200 per cent of the expenditure.The other major demands in the memorandum are full expenditure allowance for replanting, temporary ban on rubber imports pending disposal of safeguard duty application, exclusion of tea exports from the ambit of cess and concessional import tariff for plantation machineries, said N. Dharmaraj, president, UPASI.
