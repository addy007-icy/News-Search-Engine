Accusing the State government of misleading people over the issue of Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh, Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu need not go on tours to places like Singapore and Davos once SCS was given.“Investors will come to the State to set up their industrial units here and provide employment to youth, as there will be a tax holiday for a prescribed period for the States that obtain the status,” Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy said while addressing the gathering during the ‘Yuvabheri,’ a conference arranged by the YSR Congress at Ambedkar Bhavan here. Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy said that the SCS would not be of any benefit either to him or to Mr. Naidu, but it would change the lives of lakhs of youngsters.“The Telugu Desam was voted to power 20 months ago, but not a single notification has been issued so far to fill vacancies. Instead, the government resorted to removal of ‘Arogya Mitras’ from jobs,” he said. He alleged that the Chief Minister was mortgaging the interests of the State at the Centre for personal benefits such as wriggling out of the vote-for-note case.“I urge Mr. Naidu to think about the youngsters and their future. The SCS is a permanent solution to many problems faced by the State today, and the Chief Minister is sidestepping the issue knowingly, which is very unfortunate,” he said.“We have the right to demand special status. Then why should we ask for mere package?” he asked, and called upon the youth to wage a united struggle.During the question-answer session, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy said total prohibition would be implemented in the State whenever the party was voted to power. “Liquor would be available only in five-star hotels as all liquor outlets would be removed,” he said.Naidu need not go on tours to places like Singapore and Davos once SCS is givenY.S.
