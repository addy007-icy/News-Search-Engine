It was a bizarre experience for Pankaj Advani. Not for Siddharth Parikh. The sparse audience in the hall at the Emerald Heights International School watched in silence the elimination of one of India’s finest cueists in the quarterfinals of the National billiards championship here on Friday.Advani fumbled and slipped into a point of no return against an opponent who seemed to have reserved his best for this day. With 15 world titles in cue sport, Advani ran out of ideas as Parikh’s 4-2 victory gave a twist to the usual tale in the history of this championship.That Advani failed to defend his title was the talk of the day and Parikh deserved the plaudits. He rarely made a mistake when it mattered. Known to play brilliantly in patches, Parikh gathered his composure and put it to devastating use in a format that Advani was not comfortable with.Devendra Joshi (PSPB) losing to Dhwaj Hariya of Gujarat created a stir. But then Hariya was in roaring form having stunned the fancied Ahmedabad cueist Dhruv Sitawala in the pre-quarterfinals.The results: Billiards: Men: Quarterfinals: Dhwaj Hariya (Guj) bt Devendra Joshi (PSPB) 4-2 (150-109, 34-150, 71-151, 150-57, 151-40, 151-135); Siddharth Parikh (Rly) bt Pankaj Advani (ONGC) 4-2 (150-4, 52-151, 0-150, 151-61, 150-94, 150-0); B. Bhaskar (Kar) bt Jaiveer Dhingra (Mah) 4-0 (150-112, 150-95, 152-79, 150-35); Sourav Kothari (Ben) bt Sankar (AP) 4-0 (15-30, 150-18, 151-136, 150-80).
