The courtyard of Mithunam, a two-storied house right behind the building where an explosion took place on Friday morning, looked like a war-torn territory.Scattered everywhere were shreds of broken glasses, windows and doors hung precariously from their hinges, if not missing completely. Two sedans with broken windshields and ripped apart interiors gave the impression that they had just been bludgeoned with vengeance and an Alsatian dog lay stretched out on its belly seemingly far too terrified to mind the presence of strangers.The scenes inside were no different.“Everything is gone,” said a mournful Sathidevi standing amidst ruins of her beloved home. She and her husband Rajasekharan survived to tell the tale since they were not at home when the tragedy struck.In fact, a major catastrophe was averted by a whisker. For, just a stone’s throw away was a gas agency, which still had enough cylinders stored there at the time of explosion. Harikrishnan, who runs the agency was relieved that his shop didn’t go up in flames though it sustained considerable damage.Even closer to the accident site was a pre-school where a number of kids were present. “The children were so terrified and in tears that they could not be consoled. It has indeed been a providential escape,” said Sandhya, a teacher.Babul, a migrant construction worker, showed the ripped-apart roof of the toilet attached to their accommodation right opposite the fateful building. “A person who was sitting by the building at the construction site was thrown off a few metres away,” said Robin, another construction worker. T.R. Krishnakumar, councillor of Kairali Nagar, where the accident took place, said that more than 30 buildings in the vicinity sustained damage of varying degrees.
