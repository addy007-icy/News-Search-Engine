Tata Projects Ltd on Tuesday said it is commencing work on the Rs. 4,328 crore project to build a 320-km stretch of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC).The infrastructure company along with IRCON International Ltd, part of the Express Freight Consortium led by Mitsui & Co of Japan, plans to complete the work in 48 months by deploying automated track laying machines. The dedicated freight line connecting Delhi and Mumbai, one of the most important infrastructure projects taken up by Indian Railways, is expected to pave the way for high-speed cargo movement by segregating freight from passenger traffic.The project, involving civil and track works, will be executed in two packages – between Vaitarana and Sachin (186 km) and from Sachin to Vadodara (134 km). The machine, a Tata Projects release said, lays the sleepers, special rails imported from Japan and clamps them in an automated manner simultaneously.An ambitious programme of the Ministry of Railways, there are two components to the DFC project – the Eastern DFC from Ludhiana to Dankuni; and the Western DFC from Dadri to Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Mumbai. Japanese government has provided yen loans for Western DFC project under the Special Terms for Economic Partnership (STEP). While Tata Projects will leverage its project execution expertise to carry out civil engineering work and lay tracks with IRCON, Mitsui will offer its technical expertise. Tata Projects managing director Vinayak Deshpande said the company is already constructing a section of the Eastern DFC.
