Australian cricket legend Ian Chappell has called for a worldwide ban on Chris Gayle over his > controversial TV interview with Channel 10 journalist Mel McLaughlin during a recent Big Bash League match.Chappell has asked Cricket Australia (CA) to propose a worldwide contracting ban on the big-hitting West Indian following his widely-criticised sideline interview.Chappell said CA need to show zero-tolerance towards the “totally inappropriate” behaviour.“I wouldn’t have a problem if Cricket Australia said to the clubs, ‘he’s never to be contracted again in this country’,” Chappell was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.“And I also wouldn’t have a problem if Cricket Australia said to the ICC, ‘what we’re doing should be worldwide’“You’d have to talk to the individual countries then...but I wouldn’t have a problem if it was tabled at an ICC meeting that Cricket Australia said, ‘this is what we’re doing and we would recommend that everybody else do the same’,” he said.“How are you going to stop it otherwise?” Chappell questioned.Gayle was fined $10,000 by his BBL side Melbourne Renegades for his on-air mid-match comments to McLaughlin.Gayle’s hopes of returning for next season’s BBL could be over as > he is set to be banned by CA.Gayle invited controversy after he said he was happy to be interviewed by McLaughlin “just to see your eyes for the first time” during his sides’ win over the Hobart Hurricanes on Monday.“Nice, so hopefully we can win this game and we can have a drink after,” he had said.“Don’t blush baby,” the Jamaican added, prompting McLaughlin to shake her head and reply, “I’m not blushing.”Gayle later apologised for his offence, saying it was a “simple joke”.But Chappell said Gayle was a serial offender and a worldwide ban would send a strong message to up-and-coming cricketers.“If it was a one-off thing, yeah, slap him with a $10,000 fine and say ‘mate, don’t do it again’,” Chappell said.“But every woman I spoke to (about Gayle) who’s working at the cricket, you got the same answer from.“They were quite adamant about it.”
