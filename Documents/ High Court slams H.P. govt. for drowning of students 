Airing anguish over callousness of the State that led to the drowning of 24 budding engineers of a Hyderabad college, the Himachal Pradesh High Court has also shown the humanitarian side of law by sharing the plight of the parents.It has virtually slammed the government in each and every hearing over the past 18 months of the accident about its cause and the steps it has initiated to prevent such incidents in the future.Describing the death of the students shocking and shattering for everyone, the High Court in its 111-page judgment delivered on Saturday observed that awarding of Rs.20 lakh compensation each to the families of 24 students may not redress their grievances but may be a solace.The 24 students of the V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology in Hyderabad and a tour operator were swept away on June 8, 2014, near Mandi town after water from a nearby State-run 126 MW Larji hydropower project dam was released without a warning. The students were on excursion to Manali.“Unfortunately, their (the students’) bright future stands snatched away, rather cut short, and the parents stand deprived of the said source/income, hope and help in old age,” a division bench of Chief Justice Mansoor Ahmad Mir and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan observed.The students, who were standing on boulders in Beas river for a picture-postcard shoot, were caught unawares by the strong current which washed them away.Blaming the State for the callousness in preventing the accident, the court said it was also the duty of the state to monitor the functioning of the projects.“They (government functionaries) had not taken due care and precaution, not to speak of their negligence and recklessness.”The place of accident was unknown to the students, who were on tour, said the judges.“Had the authorities put boards, hoardings, sirens, signals and taken precautions at the relevant time, while discharging the water from the barrage, the incident would have been avoided and the precious lives would have been saved.” -- IANS
