The Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said he would accept any challenge of the TRS if the government confined the electoral college for Mayor’s post in the GHMC elections to the 150 corporators who will be elected. The TRS claim that it would wrest the Mayorship solely based on the strength of the voting rights for ex-officio members representing the 24 Assembly segments within GHMC area. Otherwise, the party was in no position to win the post of Mayor aided by its own corporators-elect, Mr. Reddy told a meet-the-press programme organised by Telangana Union of Working Journalists.He rejected the challenge of Information Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao offering to resign if the TRS candidate was not elected as Mayor, and said he would have readily accepted it if the same came from the latter’s father and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. He accused the TRS of resorting to illegal means to win the polls.
