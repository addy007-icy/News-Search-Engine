Globally, India lags behind in productivity of most crops and it is of utmost importance that the productivity per hectare is raised urgently to pull out farmers from poverty, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said on Friday.“Productivity and production could not be improved till the quality of land improves. Therefore, improving soil health is one of the most important issues in agriculture especially in irrigated areas where extensive use of urea has resulted in deterioration in soil health,” he told a press conference here.Improving soilCentre had been emphasising on improving the health of soil by integrated nutrient management and had announced a programme of collection of soil samples, conduct analysis and issuance of soil health card in a time bound manner.“Many of our farmers are not able to get the optimal yields from their fields, as they are not aware of the soil conditions.
