The Telangana State Council for Higher Education (TSCHE) here has received over 1,200 applications for the posts of Vice-Chancellor in the nine State universities here. Of them, Osmania University (OU), considered the most prestigious, has received the lowest applications with only 142 candidates applying for it.According to a senior TSCHE official, 330 candidates have filed more than 1,200 applications for the Vice-Chancellor posts till January 8, the last date for applying.The most preferred Vice-Chancellor post among all the State universities by applicants seem to be the B. R. Ambedkar Open University and the Palamuru University, both of which received more than 180 applications each.“Both Kakatiya and Mahatma Gandhi universities received more than 170 applications, while Telangana and Satavahana universities received more than 160 applications till January 8,” informed the TSCHE official.Constant protestsHe said that one of the reasons why lesser senior professors opted for OU may be due to the constant protests the varsity witnesses.“In the last five years or so, students have constantly postponed exams, due to which academics took a set back, and there has been a collapse. So there is more to do there,” said the official.He added that there might be apprehensions among senior professors to take up the post in OU, which has been without a Vice-Chancellor since June last year. As of now, all the State-run universities do not have Vice-Chancellors.In the coming days, the TSCHE will scrutinise the eligibility of the applicants and then forward their names to the search committees of all the nine State universities. The official said that three-member committees of each State university will then forward three names to the State government for consideration.
