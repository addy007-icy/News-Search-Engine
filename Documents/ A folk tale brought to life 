A team of theatre artists introduced the folk legend of Nanjunda and Chamundi, that is considered alien to Hyderabad Karnataka region, by bringing it to life here on Wednesday night.With a performance mixed with singing, story telling and dancing, Mandya Rameshâ€™s Natana repertory, succeeded in making the audience feel that it was a story from their own backyard.The artistes, most of who hail from the old Mysuru region, used a simple language with minimum use of regional accents or classical Kannada words.The powerful ballad that speaks against the evils of caste system and highlights women power blended mythology and folk lore into a magical world where everything is possible. Goddesses turn into pretty girls to help people from demons, men are turned into animals due to charms and spells, and the dead come back to life.The perils of polygamy and the eternal fight between the good and evil and the virtuous winning in the end with divine intervention formed the core of the story. The two-hour long play kept the audience riveted to their seats. The play by Sujata Akki was brought to the stage by Mandya Ramesh.
