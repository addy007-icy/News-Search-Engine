“It is a matter of deep concern, that the resident doctors of Delhi are worst exploited by no other than supposedly the ideal employer, that is, the government,” said Dr. Pankaj Solanki, president of Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA), at a press conference here on Thursday.Doctors have maintained that as if long hours, inhuman working conditions and repeated assaults weren’t enough, the recent exploitation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi were the resident doctors were being forced to work without pay for many months was the ultimate form of exploitation.The response that we have been getting from the authorities is: “We don't have any money to give away as salary,” said a FORDA release.Doctors maintained that they have got stuck between the blame game that is going on between the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Delhi Government and the Central Government that seems to have no end.FORDA has also decided to approach the court on this issue.
