Even as the airport at Rajamahendravaram has night landing facility and is operating six flights a day to Hyderabad, the demand for more flights to other destinations has been increasing steadily. Particularly, the local trading community is under the impression that the services of the airport can be improved manifold to cater to the market demand.Absence of direct flight services to metropolitan cities like Mumbai and Chennai from Rajamahendravaram is forcing the shippers, who have to book travel tickets to their crew, to bear the additional expenses by way of booking tickets for break journey at Hyderabad.Similar is the case with crew members from other cities to the ports here to sail on the ships. According to statistics, the two ports in Kakinada receive 72 ships per month either for import or export cargo from and to foreign destinations. In the current fiscal, 864 vessels called at Kakinada port and about 40 per cent of the ships signed-off/signed-on their crew. Thus, the traders claim justification for flight connectivity to Mumbai and Chennai from the local airport. Enquiries with the traders have revealed that there is demand for direct flights for Tirupati, Bengaluru, and Goa too, along with the two major trade cities.“Till recently, there used to be a flight that was operated to Chennai and back. It was always going full. For reasons unknown, the flight has been cancelled, thus forcing the Chennai-bound passengers to fly via Hyderabad,” observes Dantu Surya Rao, chairman of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce.Another demand from the traders is provision of domestic and international cargo facility at the airport. With the industrial corridor from Chennai to Visakhapatnam passing through Kakinada and a good number of petroleum-based industries likely to come up here, there is every possibility of a steep hike in the air traffic soon.Trading community is of the view that services of the airport can be improved manifold
