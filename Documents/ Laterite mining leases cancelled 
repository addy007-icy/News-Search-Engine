Following a direction from the State Government the District Collector has cancelled the permissions for laterite mining leases issued by the Gram Panchayat of Sarugudu in Nathavaram mandal which were based on the manipulated proceedings of the fictitious resolutions passed by the Panchayat on July 23, 2009. The order issued by the Collector three weeks ago came to light on Tuesday cancelling the fictitious resolutions under Section 246 (1) of AP Panchayati Raj Act 1994 after the Panchayat had failed to give its explanation.The Joint Director of Mines and Geology Department here was directed to cancel the laterite mining leases granted, based on the fictitious resolution of the Sarugudu Panchayat on July 23, 2009 and the Extension Officer (PR and RD) of Nathavaram was asked to file a criminal complaint against those involved in tampering of records and manipulating the Panchayati resolutions. This is because a departmental proceeding cannot be initiated since the term of the previous body has come to an end and the then Panchayat Secretary K. Krishna Rao had expired on August 30, 2014.
