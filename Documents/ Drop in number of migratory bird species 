Prolonged dry spell that prevailed over most parts of the State this year seems to have an impact on the arrival of migratory birds this winter. Bird census in three major water-bodies reveals decrease in number of migratory bird species compared to last year.While migratory bird population in Chilika lagoon, countryâ€™s largest brackish water lake, witnessed a significant rise from 7.61 lakh birds in 2015 to 8.58 lakh migratory birds in 2016, lesser number of species arrived this year compared to last year. Enumerators found that 161 species arrived Chilika this year while 172 species were sighted in 2015.Over 20 teams comprising 100 participants carried out the census in Chilika on Sunday. Enumerators could not give the clear picture about migratory bird population in Nalabana Bird Sanctuary within Chilika. Birds migrate from as far as the Caspian Sea, Baikal Lake, Siberia and Mongolia flock the island. Vast mudflat in the bird sanctuary provides them adequate feed.In Hirakud reservoir, where the bird census was carried out simultaneously, migratory bird population rose significantly. But here too, there has been a drop in number of species. In 2015, 64 bird species were counted by enumerators here, which dropped 60 this year.Similar was situation in Bhitarakanika Wildlife Sanctuary where 109 bird species flocked in mudflats in 2015 compared to 87 this year. The sanctuary area also witnessed fall in population of migratory birds.According to wildlife experts, the mudflats remained dry due to absence of adequate rain this year.
