: Applauding the odd-even rule, the Delhi High Court on Thursday said the people of the Capital complied with the scheme as they found it appealing and not because of the hefty fines, said the court.Hearing a public interest litigation on rising air pollution, initiated by itself, a Division Bench said the Delhi government’s odd-even formula had turned out to be successful and there were fewer vehicles on the roads, even though the decline in pollution levels might have been marginal.There were some “good side-effects” of the scheme, in the shape of reduction in congestion on roads, said the Bench, comprising Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva.During the previous hearing in the case, the Bench had observed in a hard-hitting remark that living in Delhi was akin to living in a “gas chamber”. The court’s observations had prompted the Delhi government to think about some drastic measures and formulate the odd-even scheme, which was launched for a fortnight from January 1.The court said the Delhi government had succeeded in publicising the concept and made it appealing to the masses. It asked the Traffic Police to “think imaginatively” and undertake similar drives to encourage road users to follow the rules.The Bench directed the Centre, Delhi government and other authorities to submit their plans for bringing pollution levels in the Capital within prescribed limits. Each department and authority, represented before the court, was asked to nominate an officer who will ensure compliance with the directions.The court also pulled up the Centre for not submitting any regional or sub-regional plan to curb air pollution in the National Capital Region as directed by it earlier.Another Bench of the court disposed of a writ petition challenging the Delhi government's decision asking the schools to provide their buses for public transport during the scheme.The court said the legal issue could be handled at a later date, if required.
