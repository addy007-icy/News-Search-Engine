Besides being an ambassador of spirituality and knowledge, Swami Vivekananda has been a true ‘karmayogi,’ according to writer Aswathy Tirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi of the royal family of erstwhile Travancore.She was delivering the inaugural address at the National Youth day organised by the Vivekananda Chair at Mahatma Gandhi University.“His speeches came from the heart, not the throat,” she said. Netaji subash Chandra Bose had described him ‘the maker of modern India,’ she said, and added that this was one of the reason why he was regarded as the father of spiritual nationalism in India.The works of Vivekananda still continued to lure many across the globe due to its depth, comprehensiveness, and universality, she said.However, Gouri Lakshmi Bayi differed with Vivekanada’s remark on Kerala ‘as a lunatic asylum’ in the context of the caste system.She reminded that the erstwhile Travancore (part of present Kerala) had set many model reforms like Temple Entry Proclamation, rights for the women and education for all. Sadly many of States in India still continued with the crude untouchability.In his presidential address, Vice Chancellor Babu Sebastian said that the importance of the writings and ideas of Vivekananda had enhanced manifold in the context of the country’s emergence as the most youthful country in the world. His words would continue to inspire, instill confidence, and inculcate nationalist spirit among the youth, he said.O.M. Mathew, Chairperson the Vivekananda Chair, in his key note address said that Vivekananda would continue to be a youth icon for centuries to come.His was a life dedicated to humanity, which he believed to be the living god.Registrar M.R. Unni, Syndicate member R. Vijayakumar, coordinator of the Chair K. Sabukuttan, and Public Relations Officer G. Sreekumar spoke.Gouri Lakshmi Bayi differs with Swami Vivekanada’s remark on Kerala as a ‘lunatic asylum.’
