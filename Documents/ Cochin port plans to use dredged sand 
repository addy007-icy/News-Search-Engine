The Cochin Port Trust (CPT) has approached the government-owned consultancy KITCO to undertake a study for utilisation of dredged sand as part of its efforts to reduce the net expenditure on maintenance dredging.One of the suggestions in this regard was utilisation of the material from the dredging. Approximately 21 million cubic metres of dredged material is currently being dumped by the Port in the designated dumping grounds in the sea 20 km from the shoreline, said a press release from the Port Trust.Earlier efforts were to use the material for landfills or as bio-fertilizers. But efforts have not succeeded so far because of the presence of heavy metals on the one side, and the problems of taking the material from the trailing suction hopper dredgers that the port authority deploys.The Port has now decided to concentrate on the area around Puthuvypeen where sand is available. It is estimated that around four million cubic metres of sand is being dredged from an area of about five kms in the shipping channel and dumped in the outer sea every year.The Port now proposes to use this sand for construction purposes after segregating and subjecting it to washing. This will be done on a PPP basis, the press release added.Around 24 acres of land is available with the Port Trust to the west of the LNG terminal in Puthuvypeen.When the LNG terminal runs at five mmpta, it will produce 2.4 MLD of de-mineralized water. This could be procured for washing operations on mutually acceptable terms from the Petronet LNG Ltd.The Port proposes to call a tender-cum-auction for a sand mining operation to be located on this land; the period of the concession will be for 30 years. The Port will undertake the dredging and deliver the sand to this area by means of pipelines.The possibility of using the remaining dredged soils will also be explored by the port authority.Focus on area around Puthuvypeen where sand is availableSand to be used for construction purpose after it is processed
