Rohit Sharma and Manish Pandey sparkled with half-centuries, but the rest of India’s batsmen put up a lacklustre performance before the bowlers came good to hand the team a 64-run win over a second-string Western Australia XI in a warm-up one-day match here on Saturday.Having won the first Twenty20 practice match on Friday, the Indian bowlers managed to hit the right notes after an erratic batting performance at the WACA.After managing 249 in 49.1 overs, the Indians packed off WA XI for 185 in 49.2 overs.Electing to bat, the MS Dhoni-led side did not have the best of starts, losing two quick wickets, but Rohit Sharma (67) and Ajinkya Rahane (41) stitched an 88-run third-wicket partnership to help the visitor put up a respectable score.Dhawan, Kohli failShikhar Dhawan (4) and Virat Kohli (7), who were top-scorers in the first warm-up game, failed to get going as they fell to new-ball bowler Drew Porter, who bagged a five-wicket haul.The WA bowlers kept pegging things back with regular wickets, and Rahane’s departure once again spelt trouble for the Men in Blue. Pandey then put his hand up to contribute a well-made 58 and stake his claim for a place in the middle-order in the absence of Suresh Raina.Pandey, who hit three fours in his 59-ball stay, managed a 60-run seventh-wicket partnership with Ravindra Jadeja (26) to pace up the innings. But the tail failed to wag, and Rishi Dhawan’s (0) run-out didn’t help matters and the visitor could not last its full quota of 50 overs.Porter (5/37) made life difficult for the Indian batsmen on a fast and bouncy track, while leg-spinner James Muirhead chipped in with two scalps. Pace spearhead David Moody and leg-spinner Liam O’Connor bagged a wicket apiece.Both the teams were allowed to play all 14 members of their squad in the 50-over game, with only 11 allowed to bat and field at a time.The first of the five ODIs will be played on January 12 at the same venue.THE SCORESIndians — Rohit c Short b Muirhead 67, S Dhawan c Muirhead b Porter 4, V Kohli lbw b Porter 7, A Rahane b Muirhead 41, Gurkeerat Singh c Inglis b Porter 6, M Pandey c Carder b Moody 58, MS Dhoni st.
