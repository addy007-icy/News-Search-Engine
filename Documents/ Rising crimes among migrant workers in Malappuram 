Three murders of migrant labourers that took place within Malappuram police station limits in less than a year has shocked the police authorities. The murders, committed apparently for money, indicated the increasing crimes among migrant labourers.“The rate of crime among the migrantlabourers is on the increase. The three murders of Assamese labourers that took place in Malappuram in recent months are indicative of that,” said Circle Inspector R. Asokan.The death of Emradul Haq, 23, at his living quarters at Munduparamba near here a few days ago was found to be a murder in the autopsy.It was a thin mark found on the neck of Haq that raised suspicion about his death. The post-mortem report has found strangulation as the cause of death. A special investigation team led by Mr. Asokan and supervised by Superintendent of Police Debesh Kumar Behra has made some progress into the investigation.“We have got some clues. We are hopeful to make a breakthrough in a day or two,” said Mr. Asokan. He said the police were after some co-workers of Haq.In the first two cases, migrant labourers working with the victims were found to have committed the murder for money. “In this case too, we suspect similar involvement and motive,” said Mr. Asokan.
