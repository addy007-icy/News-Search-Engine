Cyber crime sleuths are breaking their heads over the increasing number of cases being traced to a small district in central India. More than 100 cases registered across Karnataka have been traced to Jamtara district in Jharkhand.Taking a serious view of the matter, senior officers of the Cyber Crime Department are in touch with their counterparts in Jharkhand and have sought their help in cracking down on the gangs behind the crimes.A senior officer said, “It is not just one gang; there are many gangs operating from Jharkhand. They have a call centre-like set-up from where they call hundreds of citizens at random using bank databases procured illegally.”He said the gang members introduce themselves as representatives of nationalised banks and share some personal details of the customer to gain their confidence. He also said of 10 calls, on an average, at least two citizens fall into their trap and share their personal bank details. “Within minutes, their bank accounts are wiped clean,” the officer said.In January 2016 alone, the cyber crime police registered more than 150 phishing cases in various police stations across the State. According to a senior police officer, over 90 per cent of these have been traced to Jharkhand.“This is not new…. These gangs have created havoc in other parts of the State and have been arrested many times by police of different States. But each time, they come out on bail and resume their activities,” another police officer said.To get to the root of the problem, sleuths said they have drawn up a comprehensive plan and have sought the cooperation of the Jharkhand police to execute it. Sources said that Jharkhand police have responded positively.Reporting by Imran Gowhar
