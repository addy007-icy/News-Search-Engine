The District Congress Committee (DCC) and district unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have urged the management of Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology to withdraw the decision to hike user fee.In a statement, president of DCC Karakulam Krishnapillai said the decision to increase the user fee would adversely affect hundreds of patients from south India, who sought specialised treatment at the hospital.Urging Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to intervene in the issue, he said if the Union government failed to allocate more funds for the hospital, the State government should provide budgetary support.The decision to increase user charges for its hospital and clinical services could not be justified at any cost, he said.Secretary of the district unit of CPI (M) Kadakampally Surendran said the management should not become part of the anti-people policies followed by the State and Union governments.Charging more from poorThe decision would in a way slowly lead to charging more from patients belonging to economically poor background.The argument by the management that it did not hike the fee as proposed by the planning board was made to justify the hike.All like-minded organisations and political parties should oppose the move, he said in a statement.
