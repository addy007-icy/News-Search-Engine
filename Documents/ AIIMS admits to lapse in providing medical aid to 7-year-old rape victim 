Admitting there was lapse in providing timely treatment to a seven-year-old rape victim brought to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) last month, the Institute noted that it has “initiated a departmental inquiry in the case”.“A show cause notice has been issued to a senior resident on duty for alleged negligence in not providing timely medical treatment to the seven-year-old rape victim last month,” AIIMS noted in its response to a notice by the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW).The DCW issued a notice to the AIIMS Medical Superintendent on December 14 and sought an action taken report.“Preliminary investigations revealed that the senior resident on duty, who was to examine the child, was in the operation theatre conducting an emergency surgery, resulting in delay in examination. This, of course, cannot be accepted as valid reason for the delay,” it had said in its response last month.AIIMS explained that a note has been issued to head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Dean, where strict action has been recommended against the erring physician.“As part of a system approach to the problem, we are instituting a mechanism whereby upon receiving a suspected case of sexual assault, the CMO shall intimate the senior resident on call as well as the duty officer so that delays can be avoided,” AIIMS further said.The minor was sexually assaulted allegedly by a teenager from her neighbourhood in South Delhi’s Tigri. The police registered a case and apprehended the accused.DCW chief Swati Maliwal, who met the girl on December 13, quoted the version of the Investigating Officer and the DCW Rape Crisis Cell (RCC) counsellor saying the girl was not provided treatment for over two hours. The IO and RCC counsellor informed Ms. Maliwal that the victim was brought to the hospital in a serious condition on December 11 at 8.35 p.m. Though bleeding heavily, she was left unattended. Even first aid was denied to her for over three-and-a-half hours.The IO and RCC counsellor made a written complaint to the CMO regarding the same on December 11.Though bleeding heavily, the girl was left unattended for over three hours
