A cobra was discovered and rescued from a pit dug out for the construction of a septic tank in a south-west Delhi school earlier this week. The reptile was rescued by Wildlife SOS helpline team.“The cobra in the septic tank pit caused a lot of commotion among the staff until a call to the local police was diverted to the Wildlife SOS 24-hour rescue helpline,” said a release issued by Wildlife SOS. There were no students in the school at the time owing to the winter break.A member of the Wildlife SOS rapid response unit said: “The snake was about a foot and a half in length and was stuck in the pit. When we arrived there, it was struggling to get out, evidently alarmed by the crowd. It was impossible not to feel bad for it. Even the onlookers seemed quite concerned as the young reptile struggled to escape.”The team carefully removed the reptile and found it to be in perfect health. The animal will be soon be released into its natural habitat.Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS, said: “The venom of a young cobra is just as potent as that of an adult, and hence situations like this one must be dealt with extremely carefully to avoid alarming the “reptile. These rescue operations can be dangerous and risky, but someone has to do it in the interest of public safety and wildlife conservation.”
