Thirteen activists of the December 3 Movement, an organisation working for disability rights, were arrested on Tuesday afternoon for protesting and staging a hunger fast at the State Commission for Differently Abled at K.K. Nagar.Police said they were detained at a wedding hall in MGR Nagar. According to T.M.N. Deepak, State president of the movement, the activists had gone to the commission to urge the Commissioner for the Differently-abled to initiate action against the district differently abled welfare officer in Tiruvannamalai.“On Sunday, a function was organised in Tiruvannamalai for the distribution of aid to the differently abled. Social Welfare Minister B. Valarmathi also participated.Dozens of people with disabilities arrived at the venue only to find that there were no ramps, wheelchairs or sign language interpreters for them. Some had to crawl inside the venue. What is the point of having a programme for the disabled and making no arrangements for them?” he asked. Mr. Deepak also alleged that there had been other irregularities with the welfare schemes.“We came to meet the Commissioner to ask him to suspend or transfer the district welfare officer for the disabled in Tiruvannamalai. But the government is not relenting — they only want to protect their people,” he said.The activists then began a protest and staged a hunger fast, following which they were arrested.K. Manivasan, State Commissioner for the Differently-abled, said the matter will be investigated and action initiated if necessary. “I will send an officer for an inquiry and if their allegations are correct, we will definitely initiate action. But they wanted an immediate suspension or transfer,” he said.
