The Congress raised concerns over the fact that two successive terror attacks, including the one on Saturday in Pathankot seemed centred in the sensitive border State of Punjab. Senior party leader Ahmad Patel, however, said “we must all fight terror together,” while reacting to the Pathankot attack. Party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said this was a cause for concern and demanded to know what Prime Minister Narendra Modi intended to do about it.The Shiv Sena said the government should give a befitting reply to the perpetrators of the attack and raised the Punjab angle. Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said, “These terrorists must be answered in their own language. But the way after Kashmir, Punjab is being targeted, is a matter for concern.”
