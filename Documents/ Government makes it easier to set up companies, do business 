The government unveiled two initiatives to expedite clearances and ensure greater ease of doing business in the country.The Corporate Affairs Ministry, on Monday, announced Central Registration Centre (CRC) and Government Process Re-engineering (GPR) for ensuring faster clearances to incorporate companies and improve the ease of doing business.These initiatives are also meant for uniformity in application of rules and removing discretion, according to a statement from the Ministry. It will be supplemented by intensive monitoring aimed at providing timely approvals. These services are in line with best international practices.The GPR involves a three-pronged approach of further automating some of the approval processes by utilising advanced software tools, rationalising and modifying certain rules and engaging professionals to expedite the process of manual scrutiny.In the first phase, the CRC will process applications for name availability (INC-1 e-forms), submitted online across the country and endeavour to process them by the end of the next working day. Operations of the CRC will formally commence from January 27 and more services rolled out progressively, the ministry said.Last month, the ministry had said following several measures taken by it as part of the government’s ‘ease-of-doing business’ initiative, the average number of days taken for incorporation of a company had come down significantly — by nearly 50 per cent — from 9.57 days in December 2014 to 4.51 days in November 2015. Steps are being planned to further reduce the time taken for all approvals regarding a company’s incorporation to one-two days in normal cases, the ministry said.The introduction of an integrated incorporation Form INC29 and tighter monitoring of Registrar of Companies’ performance had resulted in faster approvals and lower number of clarifications being sought from the stakeholders, it said.New Form INC29The Ministry said it would soon introduce a new version of Form INC29 incorporating suggestions received from the stakeholders allowing up to five directors to be appointed and greater flexibility in proposing a name for a company. This will allow a wider use of this integrated Form, which is already gaining popularity, it said. The rules relating to reserving and approving names for companies are also being simplified, it said.
