The former MLA and BJP leader Appu Pattanshetty has accused MLC Basanagouda Patil Yatnal of playing opportunistic politics, by asking the BJP to appoint the former Chief Minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, as the party’s State president.Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, he said that Mr. Yatnal had been expelled in the past for using objectionable words against Mr. Yeddyurappa.“No one has used such harsh words and criticised Mr. Yeddyurappa like Mr. Yatnal did. He kept saying that the BJP has damaged its reputation in Karnataka because of Mr. Yeddyurappa. Today, the same person is demanding that the BJP appoint Mr. Yeddyurappa as the party’s State chief. After being thrown out of the party for the second time, he is trying to get back in, which is why he is trying to appease Mr. Yeddyurappa,” he said.Mr. Pattanshetty said Mr. Yatnal was now making similar comments against the former Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar and Union Minister, D. V. Sadananda Gowda.
