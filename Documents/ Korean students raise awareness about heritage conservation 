A group of 80 Korean and 20 Indian students have taken up the challenge to raise awareness on conservation of historical monuments across the Capital.Seeking to revive the lost glory of Delhi’s ageing and often unattended monuments, the Archaeological Survey of India has roped in students to create awareness about the importance of preserving heritage.The Korean students, brought in by automobile giant Hyundai Motors under its global youth volunteers camp, have been divided into four groups, with five Indian students included in each team.The students cleaned as well as polished nameplates, iron grills and even collected trash at the Safdurjung Tomb on Tuesday. They will undertake similar activities at other heritage sites like Feroz Shah Kotla, Qutub Minar and Old Fort.Twenty-year-old Young Ah Lee was taken aback by the languishing state of monuments in the city. Having arrived in Delhi just two days back, Ms. Lee complained about visitors littering at heritage sites.“This is my first visit to New Delhi, which is a hub of monuments. I believe it is important for every country to preserve its heritage,” she said.Over the course of the next 12 days, the students will interact with children at various Sarvodaya schools, while undertaking cleaning and re-designing activities within the premises.(The author is an intern with The Hindu)
