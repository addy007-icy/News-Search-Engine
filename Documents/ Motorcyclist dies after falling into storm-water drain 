A 32-year-old man died after falling into a storm-water drain on Chamaraja Double Road, which is being reconstructed.Police said Tejas, a resident of Bogadi in the city, fell into the drain while riding his motorcycle in the early hours of Sunday. Though the exact time of the mishap is not known, the matter was brought to the notice of the police only on Sunday morning.The body and the motorcycle were retrieved from the drain, which is near Gayathri Talkies on Chamaraja Double Road, by the traffic police with the assistance of personnel from Fire and Emergency Services.The drain is being reconstructed by the Public Works Department (PWD), which had also laid a concrete top on the road as part of the infrastructure improvement project.Though PWD officials claim that the road had been kept out of bounds for motorists, representatives of a local organisation staged a protest against the irresponsibility of the authorities.Rakesh Bhat, a representative of Mysuru Rakshana Vedike, who was among the protesters, said Tejas fell into the drain as the authorities had not bothered to erect barriers and take other necessary precautions.The protesters said that it was unfortunate that motorists were allowed to pass on the road even though reconstruction was underway.Though the work on laying concrete on the entire 1.1-km stretch of the road from Ramaswamy circle to Pathashala circle is complete, a portion of the road from Shantala talkies junction to Pathashala circle is still closed for traffic as work on the storm-water drain is pending.“Traffic was not allowed on the road,” said the PWD official.
