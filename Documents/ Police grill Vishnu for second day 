The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the liquor tragedy in which five persons were killed on December 7 grilled former Congress MLA Malladi Vishnu for the second day on Thursday.The incident occurred in the Swarna Bar and Restaurant, locally known as ‘Vishnu Bar’. In all, 32 persons who consumed liquor in the shop were hospitalised and were discharged later.SIT headed by City Police Commissioner D. Gautam Sawang and DIG Mahesh Chandra Laddha questioned Mr. Vishnu on the ownership and on the investment made on the bar by his family members till late in the night on Wednesday. Police, who are conducting enquiry about how the bar was permitted to run in the parking place of the M Hotel, also questioned the family members of Mr. Vishnu.The Prohibition and Excise Department officials, who were the licencing authorities, said that licence was issued to Swarna Bar only after the licence seeker submitted a No Objection Certificate from the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.SIT authorities who questioned the nine accused arrested in the case are tallying with the replies being given by Mr. Vishnu and his family members.Meanwhile, the Congress leader reportedly expressed that the tragedy might be a sabotage. “If the deaths occurred with some conspiracy or political rivalry, why the former MLA was in absconding for the last 15 days and why he had not complained the matter to the police so far. However, Mr. Vishnu has not revealed the names of suspects in the case, if the tragedy was sabotage,” a police officer said.Police are questioning the Congress leader and family members till evening at the Krishnalanka police station on the second day. Vishnu’s mother M. Balatripura Sundaramma, feigns ignorance about the functioning of Swarna Bar, and about the incident.
