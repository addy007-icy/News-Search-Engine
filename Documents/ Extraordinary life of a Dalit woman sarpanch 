Nauroti would hardly draw any attention from a passerby except maybe her traditional pallu over the head might draw a curious stare in South India.A Dalit who never went to school, after being elected sarpanch of Harmada village in Kishangarh Tehsil in Ajmer district of Rajasthan, she trained the government employee panchayat secretary on how to operate a computer and use it in village administration.“I carried the computer and printer into the office and used it for regular communication and also take out printouts of notices,” the septuagenarian Ms Nauroti told The Hindu on the sidelines of the inaugural session of the 20{+t}{+h}Congress of the National Federation of Indian Women here on Thursday. She also trained a large number of village women in use of computers.As a sarpanch she managed to overcome the opposition from the dominant Jat community and deliver benefits to the people of the village. A burial ground that was being used as a dumping yard for decades was cleared and a compound wall built around it. She also had a borewell sunk there.As sarpanch she resumed the land allocated for government health centre and had it fenced for getting the health centre built there.
