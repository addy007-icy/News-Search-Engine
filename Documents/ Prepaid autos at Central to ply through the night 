Passengers arriving at Chennai Central Station are happy that the prepaid autorickshaw service is now functioning 24x7.S. Parijatham, a passenger said: “I am leaving to Bengaluru and will be returning in a few days. My return train arrives as early as 4.45 a.m. I prefer to hire an auto from the prepaid stand. The regular autos charge as much as Rs. 500 for a drop to T. Nagar. I am told the prepaid fare is only Rs. 200,” she said. On Wednesday night alone, from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., about 150 autos went out for rides.G. Arumugham, president of Chennai Central Railway Station Auto Drivers and Commuters Welfare Society, said the response to the round-the-clock service has been encouraging. “We hope lots of people continue to use the service,” he added.But he noted that there has been dip in the number of people hiring autos following the floods. “Earlier, people here would earn about Rs. 700 a day. Now they earn much lesser. I hope things will get back to normal,” Mr. Arumugham added.He also said drivers are spending more on repairs after the floods. V. Ravichandran, an auto driver said, “The roads are very bad now. We are spending a lot on repairs. As it is, our income has declined and a portion of whatever we get has to be spent on repairs too,” he added.
