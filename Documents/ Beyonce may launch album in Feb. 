Rhythm and Blues queen Beyonce Knowles will reportedly release her new sixth album after her performance with Coldplay at the Super Bowl halftime show on February 7. 34-year-old Beyonce’s album has been ready since late 2015 but she delayed it to avoid competition with Adele’s comeback album 25, reported Aceshowbiz.“She held off on a release as a code of honour to Adele, so their records didn’t clash,” said an insider. “Beyonce doesn’t have the pressure of releasing an album and is doing bits here and there because she and her team know it is Adele’s time to shine. The last few months have been all about her comeback,” the source added. Her last album, Beyonce, was released in December 2013.
