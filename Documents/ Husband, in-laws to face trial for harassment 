A Delhi court has upheld the framing of charges against the husband and in-laws of a woman for allegedly harassing, beating and criminally intimidating her for dowry in North-West Delhi’s Aya Nagar in 2009.Dismissing the revision petitions filed by the accused against an order by a Metropolitan Magistrate framing these charges against them, Special Judge Rajneesh Kumar Gupta said: “A prima facie case for the offences punishable under Sections 498A [subjecting a married woman to cruelty], 406 [criminal breach of trust], 342 [assault…], 323 [voluntarily causing hurt], 506 [criminal intimidation] and 34 [common intention] of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act is made out against petitioners Amit [husband] and Mukesh [mother-in-law] and a prima facie case for the offences punishable under Section 498A/34 IPC and under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act is made out against petitioner Sant Ram [father-in-law]. Accordingly, the impugned order is upheld to that extent.”The court however discharged the brother-in-law and sister-in-law of the complainant in the case.According to a complaint lodged by the victim, the very next day of her marriage, as she was about to depart for her matrimonial home, her father-in-law demanded Rs.5 lakh.When she reached her husband’s home, her mother-in-law began shouting at her saying the woman’s family had only given one car and no money. The victim was abused by them. The husband slapped her when they met on the first night of the wedding, she further alleged.The complainant also stated that her husband and mother-in-law once locked her up in a room after a thrashing as her mother had sent only Rs.1 lakh instead of the amount demanded by them.
