Oil and Natural Gas Company (ONGC), its overseas arm ONGC Videsh (OVL), and Oil India (OIL) were among a list of 120 global companies put on review for downgrade by Moody's Investors Service due to “declining prices that are near multi-year lows, weakening demand and a prolonged period of oversupply.”“Oil prices have deteriorated substantially in the past few weeks and have reached nominal price lows not seen in more than a decade. Moody’s has adjusted its view downward for the likely range of prices.We see a substantial risk that prices may recover much more slowly over the medium term than many companies expect, as well as a risk that prices might fall further,” according to a company statement.Even if a modest recovery in prices takes place, producing companies and the drillers and service companies that support them will experience rising financial stress with much lower cash flows, according to the statement.The international benchmark Brent crude has fallen below its 13-year low of $28 a barrel twice in the past week, and experts predict prices could fall further while oversupply of oil is unlikely to abate in the near future.
