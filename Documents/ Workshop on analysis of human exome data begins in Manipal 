A five-day workshop on ‘Analysis of human exome data’, titled ‘Manipal Genetics Update II’, organised by the Department of Medical Genetics at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital, began here on Monday.According to a press release issued here on Tuesday, 25 delegates from different States are attending the workshop. The Department of Medical Genetics has been conducting regular continuing medical education programmes in focussed areas.This year the theme is to train people in analysing exome data for better diagnostics and patient care. Genomic technologies have advanced considerably pushing molecular characterisation of diseases in the same direction.Less costlyNext Generation Sequencing, specifically, has brought costs down and has signalled a change in the way medicine is practiced.The workshops, therefore, will serve medical geneticists and researchers to keep abreast of the recent advances in the field.ResearchSpeaking at the inaugural function of the workshop, H.S.
