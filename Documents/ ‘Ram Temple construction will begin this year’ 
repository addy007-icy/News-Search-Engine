Exuding confidence that the Supreme Court's verdict will come in favour of building Ram Temple at Ayodhya, BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy said the work on its construction could start before the end of this year.Mr. Swamy was speaking on the concluding day of a two-day seminar titled 'Shri Ram Janma Bhoomi Temple: Emerging Scenario' organised at Delhi University's Arts Faculty by Arundhati Vashishtha Anusandhan Peeth (AVAP), a research organisation founded by late VHP leader Ashok Singhal.In a tweet earlier in the day, Swamy said, â€œWe Hindus offer Lord Krishna's package to Muslims--give us 3 temples and keep 39,997 masjids. I hope Muslim leaders don't become Duryodhans."Some of the speakers also expressed concern over the pace of judicial proceedings in the matter.(With PTI inputs)
