: It has become routine for families to unwind during the weekend by visiting malls, eating out or going for exhibitions or shopping.However, paediatricians say while this could be a time to relax for the modern family, an infant in the family may not be yet ready for the regular outing.Up to two years, children do not develop their own immunity system to fight off infections, said M. Narayanan, district president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics.Crowded malls, exhibition grounds or other shopping areas full of people are also places where infants can easily fall prey to air-borne viral or bacterial infections.Dust and smoke are also a major problem as it could develop infections in infants, said Dr. Narayanan.Such cases come up almost every other day at the clinics. Enquiries about the travel details of the family usually confirm outings to malls or other crowded places, he added.The air-conditioning in crowded places may be inadequate or any person with respiratory tract infection can easily transmit it in a closed atmosphere. The lungs of infants take time to develop. It is better to take them out to an open space than a crowded place, said M. Venugopal, paediatrician.Moving about is part of lifestyle, he added. Even if young parents are advised not to take the infants around, there may be compulsions in a nuclear family.Children develop better resistance power only by about four years, said Dr. Venugopal.Pneumococal infections in children below two years can get complicated, said Dr. Narayanan. The child develops the capacity to fight the encapsulated bacteria only after two years.Eating out regularly is not advisable even for adults and older children as it trips the idea of a balanced diet a person needs to have, he added.Up to two years, children do not develop their own immunity system to fight off infections.
