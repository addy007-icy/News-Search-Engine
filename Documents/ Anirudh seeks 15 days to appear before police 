Music director Anirudh Ravichandran today sought 15 days time to appear before a city police station in connection with a case registered against him and Tamil actor Simbu over the controversial ‘beep’ song.In a letter to the inspector of Race Course Police station here, handed over by his lawyers, Anirudh sought grant of extension of time to appear, since he was in London, after taking part in a concert in Canada dedicated to Chennai’s flood victims.Stating that he will return to India in the second week of January, Anirudh told police that he would report before them as soon as possible. He also reiterated that he was in no way connected with the controversial song and that he was being dragged into the issue by some unscrupulous party who were interested to tarnish his reputation in the music industry.The Coimbatore Police had recently registered the case against Simbu and Anirudh following a complaint from the local unit of All India Democratic Women’s Association that the song allegedly contained vulgar lyrics denigrating women.Another case had also been registered by Chennai police against the two in connection with the song.
