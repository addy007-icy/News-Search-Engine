The Centre has sanctioned funds to create infrastructure for ‘Beating Retreat’ ceremony here at Agartala-Akhaura border with Bangladesh, similar to that at Wagah in Punjab.“Of the Rs. 99 crore sanctioned by the Centre to develop tourist spots in Tripura, Rs. 18 crore has been earmarked to create infrastructure at the Agartala-Akhaura border for Wagah-like Beating Retreat ceremony,” State Tourism Minister Ratan Bhowmik said.The money was sanctioned by the Union Tourism Ministry under the ‘Swadesh Darshan scheme’ for building a mini stadium and roads among others. Work on developing the infrastructure will begin soon, the minister said.The Agartala-Akhaura check post is an integrated one, which is also the second largest trading centre with Bangladesh after Benapole and Petrapole in West Bengal.The Beating Retreat ceremony is performed at Wagah during closing of the border every evening by the BSF and its Pakistani counterpart Pakistan Rangers since 1959 and is a major tourist attraction.“The Beating Retreat ceremony at Wagah is performed by the BSF and the Rangers in a bit aggressive manner. But it would be done in a more friendly atmosphere at Akhaura check post because India’s ties with Bangladesh and BSF’s relation with the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) is very cordial,” BSF spokesperson D.S. Bhati said.“The BSF and the BGB regularly perform a beating retreat in Agartala-Akhaura border and it could be a more exciting and splendid show with the building of proper infrastructure,” the spokesperson added.
