Students protesting against Hyderabad University student Rohith Vemula’s suicide continued with their hunger strike on Thursday, even as they were let off from the Parliament Street police station.Scores of students were stopped by the police on Wednesday while trying to march towards the Union Human Resource Development Ministry and detained and kept at Parliament Street police station for a day.A group of students are sitting on a hunger strike inside Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, while a separate bunch of students from the Congress-affiliated National Students’ Union of India is on a hunger strike at the Arts Faculty in DU.“Our primary demand is the resignation of HRD Minister Smriti Irani. The Ministry should fix responsibility for the institutional murder of Rohith. Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya and University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao should resign and be prosecuted under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. New Vice-Chancellor Vipin Srivastava must not continue as V-C because he has, in effect, been rewarded for punishing Rohith and his friends,” said JNU Students’ Union vice-president Shehla Rashid Shora.Students from various universities in the Capital have been holding protests and demonstrations demanding justice for Rohith and his family. A group of students from Hyderabad University have also presented a charter of demands to the Union HRD Ministry and the National Human Rights Commission for Rohith’s family. The demands include giving a house to the family and payment of his research grant that was stopped by the Ministry.
