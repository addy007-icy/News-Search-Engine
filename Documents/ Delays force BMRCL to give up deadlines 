Deadlines are out of the window as the work of Namma Metro encounters harsh ground realities.The most recent deadline given for the ambitious project was June 2016. Even this seems unlikely.Three tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are drilling their way towards Kempegowda Interchange, but since December they have not covered more than 120 metres, which leaves a further 1,350m to go. There is no headway on one of the tunnels — between Chikpet and Majestic.“It is taking time to tunnel in these stretches. The hard rock, particularly quartzite, is causing carbon monoxide and heat build up in the tunnels. We need to wait till the tunnel cools down and ensure that the area is safe for our workers before they fix rings,” said U.A. Vasant Rao, spokesperson of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. Nearly a decade ago, when construction began, officials announced that the project would be completed by 2013. Since then, numerous deadlines have gone by. BMRCL is no more giving out deadlines.
