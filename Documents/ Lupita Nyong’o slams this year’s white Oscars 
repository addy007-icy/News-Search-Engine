Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o has joined the protest around the lack of diversity at this year’s Academy Awards nominations, saying she stands with her “peers who are calling for change”.All the four categories in acting have white nominees for the second year in a row, sparking the #OscarsSoWhite.“I’m disappointed by the lack of inclusion in this year’s Academy Awards nominations. It has me thinking about unconscious prejudice and what merits prestige in our culture. The Awards should not dictate the terms of art in our modern society, but rather be a diverse reflection of the best of what our art has to offer today,” Nyong’o wrote on her Instagram.>See the nominees for Oscars 2016 here.The actress, who won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in 12 Years A Slave, further wrote, “I stand with my peers who are calling for change in expanding the stories that are told and recognition of people who tell them.”Will Smith, Spike Lee and Al Sharpton have called for a boycott of this year’s awards show that is quickly gaining momentum, prompting Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to issue a statement, calling for speedy changes in the Academy.
