The focus needs to be on the way refugees are assimilating themselves in Europe ( >Editorial, Jan.28). First, the attacks on women by refugees in Germany need to be considered. Yes, these people are fleeing crises after undertaking perilous journeys but one cannot expect politicians in Europe to be insensitive to sentiment when such issues come to the fore and when the local population begins to start feeling apprehensive. Further, the stress in terms of resources and the labour market brought on by the huge influx of refugees cannot be easy to handle for these countries already reeling under heavy deficits and stagnating economies. Ending the crises in the Middle East and North Africa is perhaps the only way out.Vinay M. Menon,ChennaiBlaming Europe for what the refugees are undergoing is convoluted logic. It is inappropriate for the media in India to sermonise to the least corrupt nations on earth or to countries which manage social services and security much better than here. If Denmark ensures proper social security, education and insurance to all on its soil, the confiscation of assets does not look to be bad.Bhupesh Singh,New Delhi
