Chaos and confusion marred the inaugural function of the 103rd Indian Science Congress at the open air theatre in Manasagangothri here on Sunday with several scientists and dignitaries going through a harrowing time.While long queues were seen outside most of the entry gates, the VIP entrance was a picture of chaos.Some scientists from abroad, including Nobel laureate David J. Gross, were found struggling to enter the venue in the melee at the VIP entrance.A foreign delegate told the security at the gate that he had a smooth travel from the U.S. to Mysuru, but went through a harrowing time entering the venue of the science congress.S.R. Niranjan, Vice-Chancellor of Gulbarga University, S.N. Hegde, former Vice-Chancellor of University of Mysore and former Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), N.S. Rame Gowda also went through a tough time gaining entry into the venue.When a journalist complained about the “bad management” to the police, Additional Superintendent of Mysuru district police Kala Krishnaswamy said the complaints should be made to the organisers and not to the police.Though there were five entrances, the invitees had to pass through a narrow gate where a metal detector had been fixed before being frisked multiple times by the security personnel.Due to the confusion, Fields medallist Manjul Bhargav, who was one of the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) awardees, was made to sit among the delegates.When it was brought to the notice of the organisers, Principal Secretary to Department of Higher Education Bharat Lal Meena himself had to intervene to facilitate Prof. Bhargav’s entry.
