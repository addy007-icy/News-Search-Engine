Union Minister for Law and Justice D.V. Sadananda Gowda has dismissed allegations made by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah that the Centre was adopting a step-motherly attitude towards Karnataka.He said that the Union government released Rs. 1,540 crore just two days ago to Karnataka to take up drought relief measures in the State.The Centre had released grants to Tamil Nadu for flood relief works instantaneously, considering the gravity of the situation, he said and added that the flood havoc in Tamil Nadu should not be compared to the drought situation in Karnataka.Mr. Gowda said that Mr. Siddaramaiah had made it a habit to blame the Centre for any lapse in administration in the State.He alleged that Mr. Siddaramaiah’s government had failed miserably to mobilise all its resources. Instead of concentrating on this, the Chief Minister was indulging in blaming the Centre with a sole intention of hoodwinking people, he said.The Union government sent a team soon after it realised the drought situation across Karnataka and based on the recommendations of the panel, it was decided to release grants to the State, the Minister said.The State government failed to produce utilisation certificates and expenditure statements to the Centre in time to get the Centre’s assistance for drought, he said.CompensationMr. Gowda said that of 950 farmers who committed suicide, compensation had been given to only about 350 families. He asked the Chief Minister if he was waiting for funds to come from the Centre to distribute compensation to the families.The Union Minister took serious exception to the “callous” attitude of Mr. Siddaramaiah and alleged that he did not attend the Neeti Aayog (Policy Commission) meeting to present the State’s plans and programmes.
