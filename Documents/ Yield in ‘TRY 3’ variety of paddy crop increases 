The yield in “TRY 3” rice variety raised at the research farms at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University – Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute is expected to increase this season, thanks to crop protection methods and timely setting up of the northeast monsoon in the district.About 18 acres of area has been brought under the crop this season and the yield is expected to be 2.5 tonnes an acre, P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the institute, told The Hindu here on Thursday.He attributed the rise in the yield this season to the continued crop protection technique being adopted by the research scholars, scientists, and farm workers of the Institute.While the actual harvest of the fields was expected to be taken up next week, a preliminary study conducted on the eve of Pongal festival revealed that the yield would be at least 20 per cent over the last season’s achievement.Students’ studyMeanwhile, the research students have taken up a comparative study on the efficiency of various varieties of paddy being raised on the farm on the college campus.Led by S. Priyanka, the students had taken up a study on the maximum advantage of each and every variety.“The number of productive tillers, length of panicles, and combining ability and sodicity tolerance are some of the factors which are analysed,” say R. Gayathri and Amrutha Unni who co-sponsored the study.Rajasekar Patcha and E. Devi Chandravadhana said the research would be closely monitored till the best variety was evolved.
