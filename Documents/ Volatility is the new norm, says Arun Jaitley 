Global economic volatility is the new norm, says Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. “Earlier, challenges and crisis emerged once in a decade. With the global economy so critically integrated, volatility is the new rule, it’s the new norm. We have seen in last few days…price of oil collapsed. We have seen the currency crisis currently on in China. And the global slowdown,” Mr. Jaitley said, addressing the inaugural session of the Bengal Global Business Summit here.While the >World Bank has downgraded the global growth forecast by 0.4 percentage points to 2.9 percent, India is struggling to improve its own growth, he said. At a time like this, the Centre wants states like West Bengal to increase the economic growth rate.“Given the structure of India’s federal polity, it is imperative that the states grow as well. Strong states mean a stronger India. West Bengal contributes nearly 6 to 7 per cent of national GDP. Given the fact that growth of the eastern states was lower than those of the western states, the additional growth will have to come from the former,” he said, adding that the Centre will stand behind states to ensure that they attract more investments.An increase in public spending on infrastructure, social infrastructure and rural infrastructure was needed, he said.
