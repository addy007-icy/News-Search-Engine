A 25-year-old woman has accused the brother of an AAP Minister of molesting her. Police have booked the accused and are investigating the matter.The accused, 28-year-old Furqan Ahmed, is the brother of Imran Hussain, legislator from Ballimaran and Delhi’s Minister for Environment and Food and Civil Supplies.Calls and text messages to the Minister went unanswered.The incident took place on Monday when the woman visited Mr. Hussain’s office in Hauz Qazi. “The woman was sent a notice by the civic body in connection with a construction and she wanted the Minister’s intervention in the issue,” a senior police officer said.Since Hussain was not there at the time, she came across his brother Ahmed. According to the woman, Ahmed allegedly made obscene gestures at her and demanded favours in return for assistance.“When she objected, the accused threatened her with physical harm,” said the officer quoting the complainant.The woman registered a case on Friday. Ahmed has been booked for attempting to outrage the woman’s modesty and for threatening her.The BJP, meanwhile, tried to draw maximum mileage from the incident by trying to pass off the Minister as the accused.
