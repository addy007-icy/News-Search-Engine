How do I fix a dripping, leaking faucet? How to repair and replace a ceiling fan? Homemaker P.V. Kailasi faced a tough time to maintain her independent home at Vadavalli.“While people living in apartments have access to a network of service providers, independent house owners have to verify the credentials of a plumber or an electrician before letting them in. Since the segment is highly unorganised, it is difficult for one to contact the right person to get the job done on time and at the right price,” she says.Kailasi along with her son S. Vivek, a design engineer have started www.servicedeal.in that connects a verified datapool of plumbers, carpenters, gardeners, and electricians with customers who are in need of help.“We thought an online platform would be the best way. We have built our database after verifying their credentials . Once they fulfil the criteria we give them a photo proof ID and enrol them. When a customer makes a request on the portal, we check the availability of the service provider and send a representative to inspect the job. We mail a quotation and designate work after getting the approval from the customer,” says Vivek.Kailasi, who operates the website out of her home, says communication skills are vital. “You are constantly liaising between two parties. We get a minimum of two calls per day from R.S. Puram, Saibaba Colony and Vadavalli with requests as varied as broken shower tap, broken glass window, a fan regulator or a ceiling fan. We have to learn the exact location and address and communicate it to the servicemen,” she says.
