Sixty-eight families from Kuravakudi panchayat near Usilampatti, along with members of Samam Kudimakkal Iyakkam, a Madurai-based NGO, staged a protest in Anna Nagar on Monday, condemning the non-allocation of land by the district administration despite issuing the patta 16 years ago.Displaying the relevant documents, the families said that they were together allocated 1.26 acres of land by the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare in 1999 but were never able to occupy the land as the ownership was claimed by a non-Dalit family from the same village.“We have filed repeated petitions to the government authorities over the years and staged protests. However, no step has been taken so far,” said P Selvam, belonging to one of the families.C. J. Rajan, State president of Samam Kudimakkal Iyakkam, said that all the 68 families, like other Dalit families in the village, were landless labourers. “How can a private person claim ownership to a land measured and allocated by the Revenue department,” he questioned.“Even as the matter is in court, the non-Dalit family forged revenue documents to claim ownership to the land,” he alleged. He said that a case had been registered against two persons of the family at the Valandur police station in this regard for alleged cheating. A police official said that while the Dalit families were indeed allocated the land by the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare department but the non-Dalit family had complicated the issue by approaching the court claiming that the land was taken over from it by the government without following due process.When contacted, a revenue official said they were awaiting the judgment of the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court.
