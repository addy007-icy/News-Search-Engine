Thulasidas said party activists would take out a protest march from Arayidathupalam Junction to the venue at 5 p.m.“We are not against Ghulam Ali performing in the country. But the party has taken a decision at the national level not to cooperate with Pakistan in any sort of activity, be it arts or sports, when it is carrying out a proxy war against India,” he said.“Let Pakistan first stop cross- border terrorism. Then we will welcome their artistes… This programme has been organised by the ruling and Opposition parties with an eye on the vote bank,” Mr. Thulasidas said.Ghulam Ali’s scheduled concerts had to be called off in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi following threats by the Shiv Sena. However, his programme was successfully held in Kolkata.
