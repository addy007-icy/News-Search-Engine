If the enthusiasm that surrounded the procession held on Monday to parade the Gold Cup was a sign of things to come, the 56{+t}{+h}edition of the State school arts festival would most likely become an event that would come to be known for a high level of public participation.The procession marked the arrival of the 117.5-sovereign cup from Palakkad, one of the joint winners of the previous edition of the annual fete. The rally got under way at 1.45 p.m. with V. Sivankutty, MLA, chairman of the programme subcommittee, handing over the cup to the Director of Public Instruction M.S. Jaya, at Kesavadasapuram.While the Gold Cup was soon taken to the sub-treasury at Vanchiyoor to be kept under tight security until the valedictory ceremony, a dummy trophy was taken across the State capital in procession. The procession was led by the Mounted Police to the accompaniment of percussions played by the students.The presence of Chirayinkeezhu Sreekantan Nair, who designed the cup that was instituted by the State government in 1987, brought much cheer. B. Sathyan, MLA; Thiruvananthapuram Mayor V.K. Prasanth; councillors S. Unnikrishnan and Krishnaveni; and Trophy sub-committee convener N.I. Sudheesh Kumar; were among those who led the parade.Over 1,000 students representing 12 schools participated in the receptions that were accorded to the procession at various points, including Pattom, Palayam, Statue and Ayurveda College junction, as it covered a distance of around 7 km across the city along the M.G. Road.The procession culminated at the Putharikandam Maidanam by around 3 p.m. Education Minister P.K. Abdu Rabb and Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar failed to turn up for the ceremony as per programme schedule. In their absence, the trophy was formally handed over by A. Aboobacker, Deputy Director of Education (DDE), Palakkad, to B. Vikraman, DDE, Thiruvananthapuram.
