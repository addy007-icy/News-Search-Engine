Mysuru MP Pratap Simha has identified places in his constituency for setting up new retail outlets (ROs) or LPG distribution franchisees.The list has been sent to Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, who had recently requested the MP to assess the demand and supply in the constituency with regard to the existing retail outlets/LPG distributorship.Mr. Simha was asked to identify critical areas that require establishment of new retail outlets and LPG distributorships, and further asked to propose suitable locations for commissioning new ventures.“Your suggestions received in this regard would form the basis of conducting a feasibility study by oil marketing companies,” the minister had said in his letter.Accordingly, the MP has sent his suggestions and urged the minister to direct officials to conduct the feasibility study at the earliest.Six villages in Hunsur taluk have been identified for LPG outlets, and three villages for RO outlets. Likewise, in Chamundeshwari constituency and Mysuru taluk, 12 locations, including some parts of the city, have been identified for setting up LPG outlets.Five places in Periyapatna taluk have been identified for setting up LPG outlets, and five places in Kodagu district have been chosen for setting up LPG and ROs outlets.Mr. Pradhan had said that if the places are found feasible, they would be included in the next round of marketing plan. In his letter to the MP, the minister had said the government was committed to providing access to environment-friendly and alternative, cheaper sources of fuel to citizens, in the form of LPG.Simultaneously, the establishment of an adequate number of retail outlets, in order to ensure availability of petrol and diesel to the various sectors of the economy, is also a priority. Oil marketing companies have been instructed to devise an appropriate scheme for ensuring availability of petroleum products for the convenience of both rural and urban residents.Suggestions were invited for setting up retail outlets as well as LPG distributorships in different parts of the constituency as the government has plans to scale up the coverage of LPG distribution, the minister had said.
