Chandrasekhar Hiremath, president of the Shramajeevigala Vedike, which is waging a lone battle against the rampant sale of liquor illegally in unauthorised liquor shops and pan shops in the rural areas of the district, on Tuesday, staged a dharna in front of a bronze bust of Mahatma Gandhi here, along with freedom fighters and religious mutt heads to protest against the decision of the State government to allow opening of more liquor shops.Mr. Hiremath, along with centenarian freedom fighter Vidhyadhar Guruji, Manikappa Patil and chief of Sananga Peetha at Sri Sailam Jagadguru Sarangadhara Desikendra Mahaswamigalu Nagalingayya Mathadhipathi and several others, took part in the dharna.In a memorandum addressed to Governor Vajubai Vala and submitted to Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Hiremath said that the government decision to give new licence to 1,750 liquor shops has come as a shock to the people. It went against a direction of the Supreme Court to all State governments to frame a policy to impose a complete ban on the use of alcohol and tobacco in public places, while upholding a decision of the Kerala government to regulate the sale of liquor in that State.He said that it was astonishing that a so-called progressive State was moving in a direction that was against the orders of the Supreme Court, as issuing new licence to open retail outlets would lead to an increase in people, particularly youngsters, falling into the trap of a social evil and becoming alcoholic.Mr. Hiremath said that the movement to make villages free of alcohol launched by the Udupi Pejawar Mutt Swami Vishwesha Tirtha was proving to be a success with five villages in Aland taluk becoming alcohol free. He urged the Governor to prevail upon the government not to give any more licence to open retail outlets and introduce Prohibition in the state in phases.
