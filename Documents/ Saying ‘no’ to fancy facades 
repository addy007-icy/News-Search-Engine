Honoured by two Indian Presidents, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Pranab Mukharjee, for the design of Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology and as the recipient of National Energy Conservation Award respectively, architect N. Mahesh has a very clear perspective: a good architect should play an active role in weaning the public away from fancy facades and should guide them towards eco-friendly and economic plan in construction.Having been in the field for 40 years, his architectural odyssey spans from the extended wings of Trivandrum Central Railway Station which he debuted in his twenties, to Cobank Towers at Palayam which enjoyed the tallest building status of the State for 30 years, Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology, NABARD, Infosys’ ship-shaped building at Technopark, Taj Vivanta, Poovar Resort and several small, medium and large edifices in Thiruvananthapuram and other cities in India and abroad.Mahesh feels a definite line should be drawn between client’s aspirations, site topography, climatology, building constraints, building maintenance and aesthetics while conceptualising architectural designs. The government too should make green technology for every building.Mahesh nurtures a dream plan for the development of Thiruvananthapuram which he illustrated through an exhibition titled ‘MVIRONMENTS’. According to him, the city has immense potential as a sustainable green city, as a heritage city, as a knowledge city and as a tourist destination.The green city concept envisages 14 per cent of the city to be retained as Green Zone to act as a ‘lung’. At least one parcel of public land from each of the 100 wards is to be landscaped with pedestrian walkways. If exclusive vacant government land is not available, a patch of one or two acres can be carved out of schools, colleges or government office premises and may be used after working hours.Heritage cityTrivandrum is fast losing its heritage sheen due to reckless construction along avenue roads, especially Fort Area. Mahesh proposes to retain Palayam to Kowdiar as a ‘Heritage Zone’ as 90 per cent of land belongs to the government and buildings of architectural importance and heritage value are mostly on either side of this stretch. Though the Fort area has been ruined by many unauthorised constructions, it is not too late to delineate an area around the Padmanabhaswamy Temple and Agraharam as ‘Heritage Zone” with development controls.Knowledge cityThe city’s Draft Master Plan has indicated that educational and research centres can be located in Chengottukonam area. At least, 1,200 acres of land are to be earmarked along the new Kazhakkoottam-Venjaramood link road passing through Chengottukonam / Pothencode belt so that public and private investors may be enticed to locate higher educational and research centres as envisioned in the Draft Master plan.Tourist destinationKovalam is still looked upon as Kerala’s pride and therefore, it is proposed to attract investment in beach front development by zoning additionally 23 km of beach stretch and 30 km of backwaters within Trivandrum district.Multi-level express wayWidening of public roads has always invited much public furore and demands strong political will for execution. The only way to sustain free flow of traffic from north to south of the city cutting through the CBD (Core Business District) is to provide a multi-level multi-mode express way with not more than six exits to the road level.The total land area of Trivandrum International Airport is 850 acres which caters to 2.8 million passengers annually. By 2025-30, expansion at the present location would be impossible, and developing another site within the district for a new airport on 2,000 acres of land, preferably towards Kollam, stands as the only option.Other proposals of Mahesh include installing smart green uniform-looking bus shelters and setting up of an Urban Arts Commission to control the ‘character’ of the city.
