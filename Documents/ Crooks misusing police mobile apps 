As part of the State-wide Information Technology initiative, the Tumakuru police recently launched a mobile app, enabling people to report incidents online and get quick responses. While the police and the public may take a while to utilise this app effectively, it isn’t so with crooks, who find a way to misuse any new technology to their benefit.A good example is the recent arrest of a seven-member gang, led by the deputy manager of a private bank from Telangana, who hacked bank accounts of customers. The irony is that they did this with the help of a police app. The accused entered customers’ phone numbers on the police app and raised a complaint stating that the mobile was stolen. This generated a receipt at the click of a button. Using the receipt, the gang got a duplicate SIM so that the alert message of the money transaction would not reach the genuine customer. Using this modus operandi , they siphoned off lakhs of rupees from bank accounts of various customers till they were nabbed by the Cyber Crime unit in Bengaluru last week.Though mobile apps are developed for the convenience of the public and the police, criminals make the best use of it, says a senior police officer. “We have brought it to the notice of the city police to ensure that it does not recur,” he said. Admitting that the police apps could be misused, another officer said there were also instances in other States where people reported vehicle thefts online to claim insurance. “We have discussed it with the technical team and are working to make the app secure,” he said.Reporting by Imran Gowhar
