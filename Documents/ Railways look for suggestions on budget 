What do commuters want in their railway stations? Clean platforms, potable drinking water, neat and well-maintained toilets and escalators may be some of the things that first spring to mind.In an effort to get a direct feedback from people who travel in trains daily or even the occasional traveller, the Ministry of Railways has invited suggestions to be incorporated in the forthcoming Railway Budget for 2016-17. People have been asked to send their suggestions to mygov.in – an online portal launched by the Centre for people’s participation.Activists and office-bearers of civic groups in the city have for a long time been demanding an increase in the train services and drastic improvements in the quality of amenities in railway stations. For instance, the Traffic and Transportation Forum has asked for doubling of Chennai – Madurai – Nagercoil sector along with electrification.The Forum also wants the railway administration to give greater attention to “environment engineering” – increasing green cover in stations and importance to aesthetics. The Tamil Nadu Rajasthani Pravasi Ekta Sangh, wants the weekly Chennai – Jodhpur express to operated as a daily service and also wants a pantry car in the train.Residents have been asked to submit their suggestions under 15 broad headers, including disaster management, infrastructure, innovative ideas, crime prevention and many others.
