In an attempt to curb open defecation in the district, Collector M. M. Nayak has proposed imposition of penalty on the violators, suggesting that the proposal would be implemented in the identified ODF villages first.He, however, did not specify the mechanism for imposing the penalty, except suggesting that open defecation free (ODF) panchayat sarpanchs must keep a watch in their respective areas and penalise those resorting to open defecation.Calling upon sarpanchs and voluntary organisations to participate in the ‘Swachh panchayats and wards’, Mr. Nayak said that ODF status would be accorded to the identified 37 panchayats by March this year and these habitation would be role model for their neighbouring villages.But, the sarpanches concerned had been delaying construction of toilets citing funds crunch, non-availability sand, and unavailability of vacant land, the Collector pointed out at the review meeting with the sarpanches of 37 ODF villages on Friday.
