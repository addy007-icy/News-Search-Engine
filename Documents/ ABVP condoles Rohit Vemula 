The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) expressed its shock and condolences on the suicide of Rohit Vemula and demanded an enquiry into the events that led to his death.ABVP national executive committee member, Kadiyam Raju, said that ABVP’s name is being dragged into the incident unnecessarily by the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) that is supporting anti-national elements and naxal ideology under the garb of propagating Ambedkar’s thoughts. He said the root cause of the incident was the provocative protest after Yakoob Memon was hanged. He said the ASA members made provocative statements during the protest hailing the terrorist that was questioned by Sushil Kumar on the Facebook - leading to a violent attack on him. The case was booked on this issue ultimately leading to suspension of six students from the hostels. “We see it as a disciplinary action against them,”’ he saidHe reminded that dalit students themselves are in leadership roles in ABVP and they see no reason to oppose other dalit students.
