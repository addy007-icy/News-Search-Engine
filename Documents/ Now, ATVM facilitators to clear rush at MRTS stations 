At Thirumayilai MRTS station, N. Krishnan asks every passenger heading to the ticket counter to come to him. Passengers look astonished before handing over the money for the ticket. Krishnan then taps on the Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM) and hands over the ticket.It is common to see ATVM facilitators on the Chennai Suburban EMU line who help clear the rush at ticket counters. Now, Southern Railway has assigned such facilitators on the MRTS line at some stations including Velachery, Thiruvanmiyur and Park Town.Krishnan, a retired railway employee, has been issuing tickets at the Thirumayilai station only for a month. Before that, the ATVM machine near the ticket counter was either not working or lying unused.“I recharge my card for Rs. 2,000, some days it gets over within three hours,” says Krishnan, who comes in the mornings.Velachery, Thiruvanmiyur, Thirumayilai, Chepauk and Park Town are some of the stations that witness heavy footfall.According to a staff at Thirumayilai ticket counter, around 3,500 tickets are sold a day at the station. “ATVM facilitators are helpful during rush hour, especially in the evenings,” said a staff.Commuters say more such facilitators must be available in the evenings.“It’s a long queue at the ticket counter at Thiruvanmiyur station after 5.30 p.m. They could be helpful to passengers,” says Sankari who travels from Thirumayilai to Thiruvanmiyur on work.At Chepauk, these facilitators are assigned jobs when there is an IPL match or during festivals such as Kannum Pongal.According to a senior railway official, 10 retired railway employees were appointed last month. “They need to give a choice of stations they wish to work at and based on the need of stations they are placed,” said the official, adding that they are looking for more people.
