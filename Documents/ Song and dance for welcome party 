On the third floor of Adhyapaka Bhavan, some 40-odd students, boys and girls, are dancing to a record of a song under the watchful eyes of Madhu Gopinath and Vakkom Sajeev of the Samudra Performing Arts.They are preparing for the audiovisual choreography that will accompany the welcome song for the State school arts festival that is set to get under way here on January 19. The mood is light, for the students, from schools in the district who have done well at arts festivals, are still learning the moves. Madhu and Sajeev have directed and choreographed the dance to a song written by S.V. Aryambika and set to tune by Hindustani vocalist Ramesh Narayan.The duo, who had choreographed a segment of the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony held in New Delhi in 2010, say they are honoured that they have got the opportunity to choreograph the piece for a festival that is part of the State’s cultural fabric and they have grown up watching and being a part of. It is also their first time at choreographing for the fete.The music and dance elements are interwoven in this piece, which reflects the ethos of Kerala, its culture, and art forms. There is no single theme, they say. “It is about the place we live in, the land of Swathi Tirunal, the youth festival, the coming together of people that it signifies, and joy.”While dances such as Mohiniyattom, Kathakali, and Oppana find their way into the piece, what is different is that they are not in a capsule form. The dance elements have been incorporated to gel with the music, and do not stand out as disparate elements, Sajeev and Madhu say.With just a week to go before the inaugural, Sajeev and Madhu know they do not have much time, but say the talent of the children will ensure that it lives up to expectations.
