The State Government is considering construction of a new extended block for Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) near the upcoming metro rail station at Erramanzil, where officers’ quarters were located in the past, to house out-patient and maternity wings as part of its expansion plans.Maternity wing would be an addition to the medical services being offered presently by NIMS. However, it would be different from the ones in Osmania and Gandhi general hospitals where the women getting admitted for maternity services only have common room facility. The maternity wing would offer private rooms for such patient at comparatively lower charges. Sources in the Medical and Health Department stated that two new blocks would also be constructed on the existing campus of NIMS at Panjagutta for cardiology and nephrology departments. Each block would have five floors each. The decision to construct the new out-patient block at Erramanzil was taken since the existing block was highly congested and there was little scope for improving facilities.Designs gettingreadyFurther, the sources said the designs for twin blocks proposed by the State Government for OGH would also be finalised soon. “The heritage block will be kept intact and the two blocks will be constructed with 10 floors each. The new blocks will increase the bed capacity in the hospital from the existing 1,000 to 2,000”, a senior official of the Medial and Health Department said adding that the average in-patient number now is about 1,400.On the expansion of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital at Warangal the sources said new blocks would be constructed on the 14 acres land to be resumed from Jails Department after shifting of jail there.Increase in the facilities would minimise flow of patients to Hyderabad from areas around Warangal, the sources said.Plans were also afoot to improve infrastructure in Gandhi hospital here as part of the government plans to strengthen public health sector in the State. All the plans would go on track in two to three months, the sources added.
