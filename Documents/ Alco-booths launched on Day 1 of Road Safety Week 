Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday inaugurated the annual Road Safety Week in Mumbai, during which the traffic police and the State government will take up various initiatives to promote safety for motorists and pedestrians.Mr Fadnavis announced the launch of the Traffic Warden Scheme, an initiative in which people will be recruited as wardens who will help manage traffic in the city. The wardens would be picked out from among Home Guards, college students and other civilians. The BMC too has promised to provide 1,000 such wardens, officials said.“We do not need to implement the odd-even formula. Instead, we will have much better public transport facilities. This, coupled with a strong tendency to follow traffic rules, will help curb accidents,” said Mr Fadnavis. “An accident affects an entire family. Road safety should be followed as a way of life.”The police unveiled alcobooths — electronic devices that test blood alcohol levels — which will be installed at commercial establishments serving liquor. “The machines will show contact numbers of taxi services and drivers for hire, who can be contacted if a person has consumed alcohol beyond the permissible limit,” said JCP (traffic) Milind Bharambe.NGO Fulora Foundation also organized an awareness drive with the RTO and the Mumbai Traffic Police. “A 100 management students stood at the Bandra Kherwadi junction holding placards requesting pedestrians and motorists alike to not litter the streets and adhere to parking regulations,” said Aditi Mohile of the Fulora Foundation.
