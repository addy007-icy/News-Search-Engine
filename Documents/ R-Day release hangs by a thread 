Over 350 convicts, who have served more than 14 years in different prisons in Karnataka, eagerly await their release on the occasion of Republic Day, following recommendations by district prison authorities. However, the matter is under Cabinet scrutiny, and the release orders may come in late on Monday or even face possible decline by the Governor citing “lack of scrutiny time”.The hitch is that the process for their release started late, only in the first week of January. Boards for prisons chaired by the concerned Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police sent their recommendations to the Karnataka Prisons Department on persons eligible for release.“A thorough examination process was carried out recently and the shortlist was sent to the Home Department last week for Cabinet scrutiny. The list will be sent for the Governor’s perusal, who will take a final call on the matter,” said an administrative official attached to the prison department.However, sources reveal the convict release process is running “extremely late”. With just a few days left for the Republic Day, the release of the prisoners depends on the Governor, who could also annul the process saying that the file has reached him very late, with no time for thorough scrutiny on the cases recommended for release.H.S. Sathyanarayana Rao, DGP (Prisons) was not available for comment.As per Supreme Court of India guidelines, convicts serving term for heinous crimes like rape and murder, murder and dacoity, crimes against women and children, and crimes against the State, are not eligible for release.
