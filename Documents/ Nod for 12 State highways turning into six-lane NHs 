The Centre, in principle, has agreed to declare 12 State highways as national highways to ensure smooth and swift movement of vehicles, and to boost connectivity. A total of 1,556 km State highways will be upgraded as national highways, from the existing two/four lanes to six lanes.Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has agreed to the development, which will involve total investment by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).Toll will be collected after upgrading is complete, Public Works Minister H.C. Mahadevappa told presspersons here on Thursday. Two other roads — Mysuru-Bannur-Malavalli (50 km), and Khanapura-Yellapura (50 km) State highways — are under the process of approval, he said.Mr. Mahadevappa, who called on Mr. Gadkari in New Delhi a few days ago, said the NHAI would take environment and social impact studies and acquire land for the purpose.Asked about road-widening between Bengaluru-Mysuru, he said land acquisition for it alone would cost Rs. 2,300 crore.On developing a tunnel at Shiradi Ghat, he said an environmental committee of the Japan International Cooperation Agency has been studying the viability of financing the project. An estimated Rs. 10,000 crore is the cost of the four-lane, 23-km-long pass planned at the ghat, which includes 12.41 km of tunnel.The project would be showcased at the Global Investors’ Meet, scheduled next month.
