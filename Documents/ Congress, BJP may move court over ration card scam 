Opposition political parties, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, on Sunday dropped hints of moving court against alleged ‘dishonest’ implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by the Naveen Patnaik government.“The government is not sincere about implementing the NFSA in its true spirit. While deserving poor people are kept out of the purview of the Act, the government machinery is more concerned about including ruling BJD leaders, cadres and supporters in the food security scheme,” alleged Tara Prasad Bahinipati, Chief Whip of Congress in State Assembly, on Sunday.Mr. Bahinipati charged: “The State government has not so far appointed food commissioner at State level and constituted district vigilance committee, which are mandatory provisions in the Act. It is busy distributing ration cards among BJD supporters.”“We have already made up our mind to file public interest litigation in the court highlighting all illegalities performed by BJD government in the NFSA implementation. The party is consulting lawyers to finalise the line of attack,” he said.The senior Congress MLA pointed out that despite detection of fraudulent manner in which BJD leaders have secured ration cards, no criminal action had been initiated against them, which raised doubts over government’s intention. Similarly, the BJP also pointed out identical issues in the implementation of the NFSA and said it was mulling to knock the doors of court.Reacting to the accusations of opposition political parties, Civil Supply and Consumer Affairs Minister Sanjay Das Burma said, “we are sincerely taking steps to bring 3.5 crore deserving people of the State under NFSA. After the issue of undeserving candidates managing to secure cards came to the light, the State government has cracked a whip. As of now, 1.5 lakh beneficiaries, who are not eligible, have withdrawn from the programme.”“Instead of making attempts to scuttle the programme, opposition political parties must cooperate with the government for smooth its implementation,” Mr. Das Burma said.
