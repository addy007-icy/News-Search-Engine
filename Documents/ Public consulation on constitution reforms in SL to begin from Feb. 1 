Billed as the first in the history of constitution-making in Sri Lanka, the process of seeking views of the public district-wise on constitutional reforms will begin on February 1.On Monday, two groups of the 20-member Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms, meant for obtaining views of the public on the issue, would visit Gampaha and Kandy. In each district, the panel will hold its sittings at least for two days, according to Lal Wijenayake, chairman of the committee. The tour of the committee will conclude in Ratnapura and Ampara on February 29.S. Winston Pathiraja, a member of the committee, explained that in respect of the earlier three Constitutions, the inputs came only from Parliamentarians. “This time, we are making the process people-friendly,” he said.Giving an account of the response received by the panel, Mr Wijenayake said 229 persons had appeared before the committee. There were 200 written submissions apart from about 420 responses including 350 through e-mail.He added that after completing its work, his committee would make its report public.S. Thavarajah, another member of the committee and Leader of Opposition in the Northern Provincial Council, said that despite having undergone “sad experiences” of the failure of the 2000 Constitution Bill and the All Party Representative Committee (2006-2010) in introducing comprehensive constitutional reforms, he remained optimistic about the outcome this time.
