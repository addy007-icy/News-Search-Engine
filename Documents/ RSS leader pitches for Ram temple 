RSS leader Indresh Kumar made use of a book release function here on Monday to make a subtle pitch for a Ram temple at Ayodhya, saying the ancestors of Indian Muslims were Hindus.He said Ram was the same as what Muslims called Khuda or Christians called God and could not be reduced to the status of just a Hindu king. The occasion was the release of a book Sri Ram Mandir.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who was present, said the court would take a call on the Ayodhya dispute and politics should be kept away from the sensitive matter.
