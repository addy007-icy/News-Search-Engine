Construction of a building for the Government Girls’ Higher Secondary School in Tirunallar has been in progress at an estimate of Rs.11 crore.The school is housed in an old and own building which is at a stone’s throw from the Sri Dharbaranyeswarar temple, known as Sri Saneeswarar temple.As a large number of devotees throng the temple particularly on Saturdays, the Puducherry government decided to use it as a cottage for devotees and, instead, construct a new building for the school.The new building, being constructed on a site acquired from a private person, will house 26 classrooms on 5,500 square metres.Its plinth area will be 2,900 square metres on the ground floor and 2,600 square metres on the first floor.The ground-floor has 10 classrooms, office room, headmaster’s room, library, and science laboratories while 16 classrooms are under construction on the first floor.Further, a government girls middle school will be built in the second phase of the project.“Accommodating devotees during the temple festival has been a challenge, particularly during “Sani Peyarchi” at this town when thousands of devotees throng the temple,” said an official.The work which remained suspended due to heavy rains, has resumed and would be completed as per schedule, the sources said.
