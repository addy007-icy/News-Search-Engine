A Bihar government website has said that the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s rule was worse than that of the British, angering the Congress which is a constituent of the ruling coalition.The mention about “autocratic rule” of Indira Gandhi and “oppression” perpetrated during the Emergency has been made in a write-up on Bihar’s history.The write-up, while mentioning the contribution of Jayaprakash Narayan or JP to modern Indian history, says “it was he who steadfastly and staunchly opposed the autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.”“Fearing people’s reaction to his [JP’s] opposition, Indira Gandhi had him arrested on the eve of declaring National Emergency beginning June 26, 1975. He was put in the Tihar jail, where notorious criminals are jailed.“Thus, in Free India, this septuagenarian [JP], who had fought for India’s freedom alongside Indira Gandhi’s father, Jawahar Lal Nehru, received a treatment that was worse than what the British had meted out to Gandhiji in Champaran in 1917, for his speaking out against oppression.”
