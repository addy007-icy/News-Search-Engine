Ten days after city residents raised issues related to traffic at a consultative meeting at the Town Hall, most of them remain unaddressed. J.R. Lob, MLA, Mangaluru City South, had convened the meeting on January 18 and Jesinta Vijaya Alfred, Mayor, and officials from the traffic police and the city corporation had participated in it.Although adequate space is available for halting buses in front of a jewellery outlet at Karavali Circle (Kankanady), buses continued to be halted at the circle, creating traffic snarls. A participant had urged the authorities to make buses halt in front of the jewellery outlet. He had urged the police to impose heavy fine on such drivers.This issue could have been addressed within 24 hours but none took interest, said G. Hanumantha Kamath, president, Nagarika Hitarakshana Samiti.Mr. Kamath said that the MLA himself had spoken about the “horn menace” created by drivers and others in Balmatta, near Wenlock and Lady Goschen Hospitals. He had even requested people to cooperate to make city “horn free”. The MLA went on record that the sound of horns was so loud that leave alone conducting classes in the nearby pre-university and government colleges, he could not conduct meetings in these colleges. Mr. Kamath said that bus drivers stopped buses wherever commuters wanted to board them. It also resulted in traffic jams. Bus drivers should not do so and the traffic police should take action against such bus drivers. He said that the slow movement of buses from State Bank of India bus terminus to Hampankatta Junction had also been raised at the meeting. But this issue too remained unaddressed.
