Pakistan is undisputedly a breeding ground for terrorism (“Pakistan ‘must’ dismantle terror networks: Obama”, Jan.25). Most terrorist groups operating there do so under the pretext of waging jihad against India and have the blessings of the Pakistan Army and the ISI. Have those who run the country forgotten that you reap what you sow as has been proven in the massacre in a school where numerous children lost their lives and again in the recent attack at the Bacha Khan University in Charsadda, north-west Pakistan? The Americans must stop all military aid, which includes the sale of sophisticated weapons to Pakistan, if there is to be any concrete action.S. Srinivasan,ChennaiThe attacks in Pakistan, examples being the one in Peshawar a year ago and the recent one in Charsadda, and those in India such as the one at Gurdaspur and Pathankot show that the civilian administration in Pakistan has no control over the military. As a result, civilians in both countries are made to suffer the consequences. Apart from being subject to nudges from the U.S. to execute corrective action, Pakistan should also be receptive to continue talking to India.Shubham Mathur,ChandigarhOne has to read the report along with the other article, “Speak to the Pakistan Army, too” (Jan.25). I find it a most inappropriate suggestion and against established international conventions. How can any government directly engage with another country’s army, bypassing the duly elected civilian government in that country? It is for the civilian government to rein in its army. Can we encourage such a situation in India when the Army is expected to function under the political and bureaucratic set-up as envisaged in the Constitution?R.R. Babu,Chennai
