The Delhi government on Monday came up with a slew of measures to ensure that there will be no shortage of medicines and consumables, as per the Essential Drug List (EDL), in all government hospitals by February 1.The government also announced that a helpline number will soon be launched for the residents to report about shortage of any medicine in any government hospital.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said patients would always complain about not getting the medicines in government hospitals.“But we will ensure 100 per cent availability of medicines and consumables as mentioned in the Essential Drug List at the city hospitals. 2016 will be the year of health and education for Delhiites.”Mr. Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain held a meeting with all medical superintendents on Monday morning.People will also be able to send a copy of the prescription on the helpline number so that Health Department can arrange the medicines. He said the EDL will be expanded to include new medicines. Also, the Delhi government is planning to do away with user charges, which is presently levied on various expensive diagnostic tests such as CT Scan, MRI scan.Informing the media, Mr. Kejriwal said all hospitals have been asked to maintain three-month reserved stock of drugs at all times, and further reserved stock of three months will be maintained by the Central Procurement Agency (CPA).Doctors at the government hospitals said that most of the announcements made by Mr. Kejriwal are general hospital management principles and have always been in place.“These are not new measures. The hospitals usually place orders on time, but the Central Procurement Agency delays the supply of medicines. The situation is so grave that hospitals do not have medicines as basic as Paracetamol,” said a doctor with Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital.Welcoming the AAP government’s decision to streamline medicine procurement, President of Federation of Resident Doctors Association Dr. Pankaj Solanki said, “It’s good that the government is focusing on this. But they will have to ensure that medicines are available and no malpractices are taking place.”All medical superintendents have been asked to send a list of medicines and consumables, whose stock is of less than 21 days, to the Central Procurement Agency. The stock will be replenished by January 26.Apart from these, medical superintendents would also be able to purchase drugs from locally empanelled chemists in case of an emergency.
