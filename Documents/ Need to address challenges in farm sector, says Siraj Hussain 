Union Secretary for Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare Siraj Hussain on Monday called upon the young agriculture scientists to address three key issues in an agrarian country like India. “Climate change, yield gap in major crops and imbalance in crop production are affecting the GDP,” he added.Speaking at the convocation of Acharya N.G. Ranga Agriculture University in Rajahmahendravaram on Monday, he said that climate change would have significant negative impact and yield may fall by 4.5 to 9 per cent depending on the magnitude and distribution of warmness.“This loss in yield roughly translates to about 1.5 per cent of the GDP per year,” he stressed.He said that though India ranked first in production of pulses, still there was a gap between production and consumption and the Union government was concentrating on promoting rabi pulses through crop development programmes like the National Food Security Mission.He appealed to young minds to provide innovative solution to marketing of agriculture produce so that farmers can get a decent return on investment made in high value agriculture.After the address, the Vice-Chancellor on behalf of Chancellor of the University presented honorary doctorate to Mr. Hussain which was read out by R. Veeraraghavaiah, Dean, Faculty of P.G. Studies. Registrar T.V. Satyanaryana presided over the function and, other doctorates and degrees were presented by Mr. Hussain.
