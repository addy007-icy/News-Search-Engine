With water level drastically falling in the Yeleru reservoir, the stage is set for pumping water from it to meet the water needs of the city even before the end of the winter and onset of the summer. The pumping is likely to begin before the end of the month, it was reliably learnt.The tenders for the pumping are expected to be finalised in a day or two paving the way for the inevitable step to maintain supply in the city.Depending upon the need, arrangements are being made to pump water ranging from 50 cusecs to 150 cusecs. The expenditure for six months to maintain supply from the canal by pumping is estimated at Rs.10.5 crore.Water does not flow by gravity into the canal from the reservoir if the level falls to 71.5 metres, which it almost touched now. The reservoirâ€™s maximum water level is 86.4 m and minimum 68.8 m.The pumping is required to meet the industrial and drinking water needs of the city. About 25 MGD of water is drawn from the reservoir, roughly accounting for 40 per cent of the water required for the city.Last year the pumping was taken up in April and continued till September without resorting to alternate day supply.This year the pumping had to be advanced by three months owing to paucity of rain in the catchment area of the reservoir, it was learnt.Besides, Yeleru reservoir provides water to the standing crop in the ayacut area.Sources said GVMC had written to the government as early as in October about the scarce water situation in the reservoir and urged it to give priority to the city.Water levels in the other reservoirs, notably Tatipudi, Raiwada and Meghadrigedda, are good enough to see the city through the summer, it was learnt.However, the area catered to the in the city and bulk water supply would suffer with the poor levels in Yeleru reservoir.It is expected that the supply in Gajuwaka may particularly turn critical as summer sets in and advances.The tenders for the pumping areexpected to be finalised in a day ortwo paving the way for the inevitablestep to maintain supplyin the city
