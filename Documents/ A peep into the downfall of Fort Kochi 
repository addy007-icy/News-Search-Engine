hat was once considered among the best- maintained playgrounds in the country during the colonial era is now a picture of neglect – symbolising the shabby upkeep of tourism and allied infrastructure in Fort Kochi heritage zone, a hub for foreign tourists.Tall claims by Kerala Tourism that it had lined up projects worth Rs 19 crore since 2012 for supplementing tourism infrastructure in the region fall flat in the face of the plight of this and so many other heritage memorabilia.The inability of Fort Kochi Heritage Conservation Society to set things in order also has been inviting criticism.The Parade Ground located next to the famed St Francis Church where Vasco Da Gama was first buried, got its name as the Portuguese, Dutch and the English conducted their military parades and drills here.Popular football coach Rufus D’Souza was training two dozen kids and teenagers as The Hindu caught up with him at the ground on Tuesday.“I have been teaching children here for the past 45 years.The ground’s plight deteriorated during the past two decades,” he said.With the turf losing out to mud, broken stones and garbage, dust arose whenever children ventured into the ground.This poses severe health hazards. The silver lining is that some works are expected to re-turf the ground.“I guess this will not be yet another undelivered promise.The ground must be fenced as well, to keep vehicles at bay. Revenue and tourism officials must get their act together to restore grounds and open spaces in Fort Kochi to their past glory,” Mr D’Souza said.
