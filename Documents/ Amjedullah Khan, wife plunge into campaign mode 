Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjedullah Khan is fighting the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) election for the third time in a row.Interestingly, he chose a different ward this time too or rather was forced to do so, as he says.The St. Paul’s High School alumni made his debut from Chanchalguda ward in 2002 and then emerged victorious from Azampura in 2009.“This time, the Azampura seat was reserved for woman. So I choose to contest from Akbarbagh ward as locals there wanted me to represent them and develop their area,” the 40-year-old leader says.There are 41,855 voters in the Akbarbagh ward belonging to different caste and creed.“Voters here are not divided on the lines of caste or creed. The area has literate population and all live happily leaving little room for communal politics to creep in. So my chances of a win are bright here,” Mr. Khan claims.For the first time, the family has fielded Asma Khatoon, wife of Amjedullah Khan, from the Azampura ward. “Women in our family have always stood along men in tough times,” the leader said.
