: From time to time, the younger generation has been influenced by the actions and speech of popular characters in movies. Likewise, movies have always been blamed for the bad behaviour of youngsters. Hence ‘Our Responsibility to Children’ (ORC), an organisation working towards preventing criminal tendencies among children, felt that movie personalities were best suited to impart the right knowledge to children.Noted film-maker Anjali Menon has been doing the rounds in schools in the district over the last two days as a Celebrity Mentor of ORC, talking to children about their choices and responsibilities. In simple words and with the help of movie scenes and scenarios, she explains to them how to take control of their lives. “You are the director, cinematographer, editor and many other things in your life, if it were a movie. You decide how it should move forward,” she explained to the students of Zamorin’s Higher Secondary School in Thali here on Tuesday, wrapping up her two days with children.She talked to the children about everybody’s need for a mentor, the need of a purpose in life and the need to ask questions wherever necessary. “The response has been very good in all the schools she spoke. The children had a good interaction with Ms.Menon. They had a lot of questions for her,” Managing Trustee of ORC P.I. John told The Hindu .Ms. Menon interacted with students of Government Ganapath HSS in Feroke, Government Vocational HSS, Meenchanda, Government Model HSS, Mananchira, Government HSS, Kunnamangalam and JDT HSS, Veelimadukunnu besides Zamorin’s HSS in the two days.
