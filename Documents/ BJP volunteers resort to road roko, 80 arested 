As many as 80 volunteers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were arrested when they resorted to a road roko in Rainbow Nagar here on Monday demanding the Government to immediately remove encroachments on storm water canals and water bodies.Leading the demonstration, BJP MLA M. Visweswaran said that encroachments on storm water canals and water bodies were found to be the major hindrance in the smooth flow of water. This resulted in inundation of several residential localities in the recent torrential rains and subsequent flooding.Private players also encroached on water bodies and this had shrunk them. The government should immediately launch a drive to remove all encroachments and recover the cost from the private parties, he said.
