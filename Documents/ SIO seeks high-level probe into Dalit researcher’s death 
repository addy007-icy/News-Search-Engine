Members of the district unit of Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIO) staged a dharna in front of the Clock Tower here on Tuesday, demanding a high-level probe into the “unnatural” death of a Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula at the University of Hyderabad.Mr. Vemula allegedly committed suicide on January 17, a fortnight after he was expelled from his hostel, along with four researchers by the University authorities. The five Dalit students of Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) were on a sleep-in strike on the campus since their expulsion.Addressing protestors here, Suresh B.P., leader of Bahujan Vidyarthi Sangha, said that the death of Vemula was due to his expulsion by the university authorities.It was the inhuman attitude of the administration of the university, which had led to the unnatural death. The entire administration of the University was responsible for it, he said.Jayan Malpe, convener of district unit of Karnataka Dalit Sangharsh Samiti, said that the death of Mr. Vemula showed that casteism was still rampant in the society. The harsh action of expulsion showed the callous attitude of the University towards the Dalits.The mindset of some persons was such that they did not want Dalits to get higher education.Mr. Vemula came from a humble background as his mother was a farm worker. Some Hindu seers always asserted that there was no casteism in Hindu society. “If the death of Mr. Vemula is not a result of casteism, what is it? The atrocities on Dalits have not ceased in the country, no matter how much claims of development the Union government makes” Mr. Malpe said.
