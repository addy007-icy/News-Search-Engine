Autorickshaw drivers of Kasaba Bengre area on Monday held a protest demonstration in front of the Mangaluru Old Port office demanding regularisation of autorickshaw parking area in Bengre. Democratic Youth Federation of India district vice-president B.K. Imtiyaz led the demonstrators, who said the drivers had been ferrying passengers for minimum fare of Rs. 20 as against Rs. 23 prescribed by the regional transport authority. The service has been of much use to the residents of Kasaba-Bengre after they get down from the ferry at the Bengre jetty. Attempts to remove autorickshaw parking area near the jetty is condemnable, Mr. Imtiyaz said.
