Writer Nayantara Sahgal, who has been protesting against “rising intolerance” in the country, on Saturday said she was waiting for the day when the Culture Minister draped statues at Khajuraho with a sari.“The way things are proceeding now under Hindutva, I am just waiting for the day when the Culture Minister puts saris on the statues at Khajuraho because they are in a very dramatic sexual postures,” Ms. Sahgal said at a session of the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet (TSKLM).While talking about censorship, the 88-year-old, who has returned her Sahitya Akademi award in protest against “rising intolerance”, said the space for dissent has vanished and dissenters are now being attacked with sticks, stones, black paint and even murder.“The silence of the government is its answer. Or it is busy defending the Hindutva ideology,” she said, adding that censorship by mob has taken over.“It is the mob which decides what is going to be censored with threats, guns and violence,” Ms. Sahgal said.
