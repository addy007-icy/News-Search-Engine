The abrupt transfer of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) of Kudligi sub-division in Ballari district, at the behest of Labour and district in-charge Minister P.T. Parameshwara Naik is getting more suspicious.Mr. Naik, who till Tuesday afternoon maintained that the transfer of the DySP Anupama Shenai was an administrative matter and he had no role in this regard, claimed he got the official transferred mainly because she did not respond to his calls. Mr. Naik has been caught making the claim in a video footage, said to be taken at a party workers meeting held in Hampasagar village in Hadagali assembly constituency on Tuesday. The video has gone viral in the social media and is also being aired on regional electronic media channels.“For me, the party workers are important and not officials. I spoke to her over the phone for 42 seconds and after that when I tried again, she did not respond. This was the reason why I got her transferred. Why do we need officials who do not listen to the District Minister,” he is heard saying in the video footage.A week ago, Ms. Shenai got a call from an ‘unknown’ number with the caller stating that the district in-charge Minister wanted to speak to her. While she was waiting for the Minister’s response, she got another call from the Superintendent of Police. She cut the earlier call and spoke to SP. Later, she got another call stating that the Minister would be speaking to her. Mr. Naik, reportedly took her to task for not holding the call and said he would take up the issue with her higher ups. In less than 48 hours, Ms. Shenai was shunted out of the district on deputation to Indi sub-division in Vijayapura district.
