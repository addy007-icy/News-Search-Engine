It includes approaches on NH-1 (Srinagar–Sonmarg–Gumri Road) in Jammu & Kashmir on a design, build, finance, operate & transfer (annuity) basis.The project has a strategic and socio-economic importance as it will provide much needed all-weather connectivity between Jammu & Kashmir and Leh-Ladakh, which remains cut off during winter due to heavy snowfall, said a company statement. IRB Infra will receive semi-annual annuity of Rs 981 crore from the government after construction of the project. This will be received twice a year till the end of the concession period.Tunnel, to be built in J&K at a cost of Rs 10,050 crore, is the longest in South-East Asia
