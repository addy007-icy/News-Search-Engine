Mumbai Under19s will hope to keep its juggernaut rolling in the semifinal of the Cooch Behar Trophy in an all-West Zone tie against Gujarat, to be played at Valsad from Monday.Shams Mulani’s boys coped with the absence of run-machine Armaan Jaffer quite well in the last week’s quarterfinal. Despite Jaffer, who had amassed 1,018 runs in the league stage, having to join the India Under-19 squad’s preparatory camp for the U-19 World Cup, Mumbai edged past Bengal in the quarterfinal on the basis of a slender seven-run first innings lead.“Armaan is obviously a huge gap to fill in but while he starred with a stellar effort, the rest of the specialist batsmen have also impressed,” Mumbai U-19 coach Vinod Raghavan told The Hindu from Valsad. “All of them have been among runs and we hope the squad will deliver as a group over the next four days.”Captain Mulani (570 runs at 71.25), Prithvi Shaw (586 at 65.11) and Adeeb Usmani (484 at 53.77) and Hardik Tamore (434 at 48.22) have tallied 400-runs in the season so far.Baroda will face Uttar Pradesh in the other semifinal.MUMBAI SQUAD: Shams Mulani (capt), Sairaj Patil, Adeeb Usmani, Rudra Dandey, Ashay Sardesai, Onkar Jadhav, Khizar Dafedar, Minad Manjrekar, Danish Rainee, Prithvi Shaw, Shubham Pandey, Hardik Tamore, Omprakash Jaiswal, Sidak Singh, Aditya Shinde, Anish Chaudhary.OTHER RESULT: Vijay Merchant Trophy U-16 quarterfinals: Mumbai 418 for seven in 184 overs (Shreeraj Anant Gharat 160, Yashasvi Jaiswal 98, Satyalaksh Jain 59, Mohd. Fateh Ullah Khan four for 91) vs Madhya Pradesh.
