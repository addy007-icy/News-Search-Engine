The Central government should immediately roll back the excise duty hike for petrol and diesel, the KPCC president V. M. Sudheeran has demanded.A press note issued here said this was for the eighth time since assuming office that the Modi Government has increased the excise duty for petrol and diesel. The last hike was on December 16, 2015. There has been a strong protest in the country over the fact that fuel prices have not come down commensurate with the dip in fuel prices in the international market.When the Modi government took office in May 2014 the price of crude oil in the international market was 104.78 dollars to a barrel. Now, the price is 34 dollars. However, instead of reducing fuel prices the government has repeatedly imposed an excise duty hike on the people. Stronger protests should emerge this, the press note added.
