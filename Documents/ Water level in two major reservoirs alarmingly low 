Water level in the two major reservoirs – Sri Ram Sagar and Nizam Sagar – in the district is unusually low in any given year this season and the prospect of unprecedented drinking water crisis, let alone water for irrigation, looms large in the coming months.The Nizam Sagar Project is in much worse condition than the SRSP as water is even below the dead storage level. After the recent release of water to fill tanks for drinking purpose, only about 0.157 tmc ft remains in the project. For the first time in the last three decades, the situation has gotten worse as this year, water wasn’t released to the reservoir built across river Manjeera, which was the important tributary of the Godavari way back in the early 1930s. A crisis like this is said to have occurred only four times in the long history of NSP – in 1962, 1976 and 1986. The past glory of the project, a lifeline for the district, gradually came to naught after the construction of Singur balancing reservoir for the purpose of providing water to the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.Keeping this in mind, the authorities had advised farmers not to cultivate paddy in its ayacut of 2.75 lakh acres and go only for ID crops. The requests went unheeded as farmers cultivated paddy wherever bore-well water was available. However, water wasn’t given for the project either for kharif or rabi. The SRSP, for the first time in 28 years, received a minimum of 2.1 tmc ft of inflows.At present, the water level is at 1049.10 tmc ft with only 6.10 tmc ft available as against its full reservoir level of 1091 tmc ft. Only 1.10 tmc ft is available over the dead storage level. According to Deputy Executive Engineer T. Jagadish, the project witnessed the worst situation in 1987 when the water level came down to 1011.0 tmc ft.
