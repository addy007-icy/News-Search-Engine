Expressing concern over open defecation in the national Capital, the Delhi High Court has said the lack of public toilets in the city was “disgraceful”. The court has now asked the municipal bodies and Railways if they had constructed adequate community latrines in the areas under their jurisdiction.Earlier this week, during the hearing of a public interest litigation filed by an NGO seeking rehabilitation of manual scavengers, the court was informed that there were not enough toilets in the city. The PIL was filed in 2007.The NGO had told a Division Bench comprising Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that the civic bodies, the Delhi Cantonment Board and the Railways were required to construct adequate latrines under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. Such toilets were to be constructed within three years of commencement of the legislation, the court was told.The NGO pointed out that people were being charged for using the existing public toilet facilities, while the poor people were unable to pay the amount on a daily basis.The Bench has now directed that the affidavits to be filed by the respondents should indicate whether they had any policy for imposing monetary charges on people using the public toilets. It also sought details about a survey carried out on the number of manual scavengers in the city and asked why a survey had not been conducted to find out the number of sanitary latrines.Posting the matter for January 20, the Bench directed the Delhi government to submit an affidavit stating if all the provisions of the Act of 2013 were being complied with.
