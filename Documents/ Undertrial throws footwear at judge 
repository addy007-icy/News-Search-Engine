Nisha. But it fell on the table,” he said.Ezhumalai was immediately removed from the court premises and taken to Puzhal again. “We have registered a case under section 355 (Assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation) and section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty). We will be investigating why he threw the footwear at the Judge,” said a police officer.
