The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed the plea moved by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) challenging its suspension for two years from participating in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The court dismissed the petition on the ground that it is not maintainable within the limitations prescribed by the Supreme Court.In its petition CSK alleged that the actual offender responsible for betting and spot fixing in IPL season six has been “conveniently” let off without even a fine and instead every single cricketer contracted with CSK, and thousands of its fans have been punished by suspending the franchise.K. George John, Manager of the team, sought the curt to quash the Lodha Committee report and to direct the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to permit CSK to participate in the IPL matches.Dismissing the petition, the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and T.S. Sivagnanam said, "The petition does not fall under the window prescribed by the Supreme Court. It is dismissed as not maintainable."The Bench also dismissed a PIL moved by Subramanian Swamy with a similar plea.
