With water in the Singoor reservoir going below the dead storage level, the district may face crisis in the coming summer season.According to the official sources, the water level stood at 0.8 tmc ft compared to the last year when it was 13 tmc ft. This explains the prevailing condition in the district and the severity of drought that has adversely hit the farming activity.The water spread area in the project has drastically reduced from 168 km to just 28 km and the depth was put at six metres, including two metres of silt and only four metres of water at places where it is available.Given the fact that water is below the dead storage level, it cannot be released through gates and has to be pumped with the help motors, if required. This is being attributed to deficient rains in the catchment area. Though there exists 2 metres of silt in the reservoir and this being the right time to remove it, no proposal has been sent to the government under Mission Kakatiya.Officials corroborated this by stating that they have not received any instructions in this regard. Removing silt may prove a Herculean task, but what is even more difficult is depositing it. “It may not be possible to remove that much silt, but it will be helpful in increasing the storage capacity,” said an official, seeking anonymity.The officials are trying to identify locations in low laying areas where water is stored and divert it to the sources from which water can be supplied to drinking water projects. More than 400 villages in Andol, Sangareddy, Narsapur and Dubbak constituencies are being supplied with drinking water through this project.However, the officials are proposing to dig canals to supply water. But it was said that the Forest Department has been objecting to this stating that it would force crocodiles to enter residential areas.
