Tribal groups have decided to go ahead with animal sacrifice as they are gearing up to celebrate the annual Sulia Yatra in Bolangir district on January 12.Hundreds of animals will be slaughtered at two places near district headquarter town of Bolangir despite activists pleading against the same and likely clamping of prohibitory order by district administration.“We had a grand preparation meeting recently. All members unanimously decided to observe our age-old tradition,” said Maya Pradhani, Secretary of Milita Sulia Yatra Puja Committee.To make the animal sacrifice a peaceful affair, the committee constituted a peace committee and urged Bolangir district administration to facilitate smooth celebration of the yatra.“The district administration has been clamping prohibitory order under Section 144 of CrPC at the place of worship. As a result of which we were forced to carry out animal sacrifice a little distance away from the place,” said Mr. Pradhani.He cautioned against any action to stop the yatra, saying, “this is a tradition we have been following for years. Hundreds of goats and lambs are being killed on roadside everyday while nobody raises any objection. Thus we should not be prevented from following our tradition”.During the two-day long yatra, buffaloes, goats, lambs and chicken will be killed and their blood offered to the deities. Tribals from Bolangir, Bargarh, Sambalpur, Kalahandi, Angul, Dhenkanal and Sundargarh come to Bolangir to sacrifice animals.
