“Early intervention can change any chronic disease,” Isaac Mathai, a physician practising holistic health, said at a function on Monday.While delivering the 29{+t}{+h}K. Gopalakrishna Endowment Oration on ‘Holistic and Integrative Medicine: The Medical Approach for the Future,’ Dr. Mathai said, “Unfortunately, the western medical concept mostly treats a person like a consumer and sells the service. You can generate money. You should see how ancient China worked. There, the doctors who treated fewer patients were paid more,” Dr. Mathai said.He said that according to World Health Organisation, 80 per cent of the world population was still dependent on traditional medicine. “Breathing is one of the most important tools for improvement of health. It has been scientifically proven now that breathing tools have a positive impact on the brain,” he added.R. Seshasayee of Infosys said Mr. Gopalakrishna had faced several challenges during his time with regard to the industry.“Starting something then was very difficult, from getting an approval from the Central government to licenses. In every way, he swam against the current with determination and courage,” he said.
