A High Court judge on Monday cautioned the government that the State will lose out on investments if measures are not taken to ease traffic on Ballari Road that connects the city to the Kempegowda International Airport. Justice A.N. Venugopala Gowda made this observation orally when Additional Advocate General A.S. Ponnanna reminded him of certain observations made by the former on an earlier occasion on the city’s traffic and air pollution.He said that the absence of a parallel road has led to this chaotic situation.“Such a scene on a road leading to the airport may not attract investors,” he added.He also said that it takes at least 50 minutes for him to reach his official residence at Nyaya Grama near Hebbal from Basaveshwara Circle.
