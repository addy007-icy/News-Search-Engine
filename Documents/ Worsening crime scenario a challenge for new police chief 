Taking charge as the new police commissioner of the twin cities at a crucial time, the 1990-batch IPS officer Y. B. Khurania will have a lot of challenges ahead of him, particularly in handling the crime and law and order situation in Cuttack city.Apart from the new-found challenges from the terrorists’ presence, a study on last year’s law enforcement activities of Cuttack city reveals that criminal activities here have increased manifold and the elite Commissionerate police have failed to check them effectively.While the city recorded a five per cent increase in registration of cases in 2015, heinous crimes such as rape and murder continued to grow sharply. Even though 2015 was not an election year, the city witnessed 31 rioting cases. Crime cases such as dacoity, robbery, burglary, theft and swindling also witnessed upward trend in Cuttack city during 2015 and the police were able to recover only 33 per cent of the stolen properties.The city also witnessed five tender-related offences in the year.The statistics revealed that at least 42 rape cases were registered in the city last year, of which 35 turned out to be allegations arising out of failed affairs. “Freedom of intimacy between young boys and girls contribute heavily towards increase in such cases,” said a top cop.Even other miscellaneous cases such as gambling, eve teasing, dowry torture and atrocities on Dalits too have increased. Against 404 excise cases registered in 2014, the city registered 462 cases in 2015 with an increase in number of arrests as well. Similarly, five NDPS cases were also registered in which seven persons were arrested last year.
