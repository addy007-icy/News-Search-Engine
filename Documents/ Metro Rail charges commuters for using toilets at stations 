Chennai Metro Rail has started charging people for using toilets in some of its stations recently.Authorities are charging money to prevent people from misusing these public facilities which have been created in all the stations between Koyambedu and Alandur – the 10 kilometre stretch that was made operational in June last year.According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), at stations like Koyambedu, CMBT, Vadapalani and Ashok Nagar where the toilets are in the non-paid area of the station, people who do not use the elevated train services also use the toilets.“They have been using them for some time now and hence we decided to charge Rs. 2 from non-commuters too for using toilets in these stations,” an official said.“People who live around CMBT station started taking bath regularly. In stations like Ashok Nagar, miscreants started stealing accessories in toilets. The maintenance became a challenge,” he said. They have also posted personnel outside the toilets in these stations to ensure there are no thefts, he added.When asked if Rs. 2 had prevented non-commuters from using the washrooms, the official said: “We no longer see people misusing toilets. We also did not want to overcharge our regular commuters, hence the nominal fee.”
