The government has laid underground sewage network in Bantwal without building a sewage treatment plant (STP). Though the sewage network in Ullal town is ready, it cannot construct the STP in the only available site due to a court case.The matter came to light at a review meeting conducted by Urban Development Minister Vinay Kumar Sorake here on Monday.Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim said that as the STP in Bantwal was not ready, many were letting sewage into open drains, which ultimately joined the Nethravathi. He requested the Minister to direct the authorities concerned to build the STP at Bantwal at the earliest. Unless the STP is ready, house connections cannot be given.An official of the Ullal City Municipality told the gathering that though the government had issued the final notification for acquiring land for building the STP, a person has approached the court against acquiring land for it. Though the court has not ordered against building the STP, residents in the area objected against work commencing. No alternative site was available either. The Rs. 26 crore UGD project could not be completed without a treatment plant.Responding to it, Mr. Sorake directed the official to settle the issue amicably by convincing the residents as well as those who had approached the court.An official of the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation said that if the second stage of water supply and underground drainage project, implemented after availing a loan from the Asian Development Bank, was to be implemented in Mangaluru city, land would be needed for building associated facilities. Land was required at 18 places for water supply projects, and at 29 places for the UGD project.
