As the countdown for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls begins and battle lines get drawn for supremacy in the city, the prime opposition alliance of BJP and TDP claims to be sitting pretty. Playing down the high voltage campaign launched by the ruling TRS), the alliance members say it has been moving in a more organised fashion with a focus on strengthening its ties with the electorate that helped it win 14 of the 24 Legislative Assembly seats in elections last year.“We are going to improve our strength in the city with the coming civic body election. The TRS is using the entire official machinery and trying to splash the city with hoardings and banners but that will not help them win the elections,” says a BJP city leader.The party State president, G. Kishan Reddy feels the high profile campaign shows the unease of TRS in going to polls and argues that high visibility alone will not help the ruling party with a win. “The TRS has delivered nothing to the voters since it came to power and that is the underlying hesitation for them in going ahead with the elections,” he says.The last couple of weeks have seen teams of Ministers going on an inauguration and foundation stone laying spree across the city and Mr. Reddy does not see the possibility of the ruling party reaping any fruits of it.“The voters are clear, they have supported us earlier and we hope garnering more support now,” he says. Together, the TDP and BJP have already carried out a series of division-wise meetings and discussions on seat sharing, were in an advanced stage.Last date for nominationsAs per the amendments effected to the GHMC Act by the State Government on Monday, the last date for making nominations would be a period of not more than three days from the date of notification, whether or not these days are public holidays.
