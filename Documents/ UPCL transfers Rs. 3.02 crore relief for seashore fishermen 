(UPCL) has transferred Rs. 3.02 crore to the district administration to be given as compensation to 302 “Kairampani” or traditional seashore fishermen for the problems suffered by them during the laying of a pipeline for the thermal plant.Yellur Bharat Kumar, head of the Six Traditional Seashore Fishermen’s Associations, said on Thursday that when the pipeline was laid to pump in and pump out water for the coal-based thermal plant of UPCL, the seashore fishermen could not cast their nets in the area between Yermal Tenka and Yermal Bada villages. As a result, they suffered a fall in fish catch, affecting their income.Hence, the association had urged the State government in 2009 to provide compensation for the fall in fish catch. The 302 fishermen belonged to six “Kairampani” funds or associations.After lot of efforts by these associations, and support from elected representatives, the company had agreed to provide a compensation of Rs. 3.02 crore for these affected fishermen at the rate of Rs. 1 lakh per fishermen, Mr. Kumar said.R. Vishal, Deputy Commissioner, said that the administration received the amount from the company about a week ago.He had approved the transfer of fund to the Udupi Tahsildar.He had directed the Tahsildar to verify the claims and disburse the amount to the 302 eligible fishermen in close coordination with the Joint Director of Fisheries. “I have told them to disburse the amount to the fishermen in a camp mode,” he said.
