The High Court of Karnataka on Monday stayed for eight weeks the process of recruiting 100 assistant and junior engineers to the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB).A Division Bench comprising Justice N. Kumar and Justice Pradeep D. Waingangar passed the order on a PIL petition filed by R. Vinay Kumar, a resident of Shivamogga and other engineering graduates. The petitioners have questioned the decision of the government to make selection based on marks secured by the candidates in their engineering examination, instead of selecting candidates through competitive examination or aptitude test as per the norms. It was complained that the decision to rely on engineering course marks would prove disadvantageous to engineering graduates, who secured their degrees from around 160 private engineering colleges and 15 government engineering colleges that were affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), and prove advantageous to those graduated from autonomous private engineering colleges. The petitioner contended that there is seven per cent difference between the grading system adopted by the autonomous engineering colleges and by VTU. Moreover, the autonomous engineering colleges grant marks liberally to students and hence they secure better grades, they claimed.
