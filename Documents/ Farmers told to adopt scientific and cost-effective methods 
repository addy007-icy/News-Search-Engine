It is time that farmers, particularly with small and marginal holdings, think rationally by adopting cost-effective and scientific methods of farming instead of landing into debt, said Ashok M. Pattan, Ramdurg MLA and Congress government Chief Whip.Inaugurating the three-day annual flower show at Hume Park on Club Road on Monday, he said farmers needed to be cautious while taking up agricultural operations by adopting the governmentâ€™s subsidised schemes. They should use the benefits provided by the government to increase productivity.Pointing out the lack of knowledge of modern and cost-effective agricultural methods, he said a large number of small and marginal farmers had turned bankrupt and ended their lives under the duress of debt.This could be prevented if the farmers are provided timely advise by officials of the Agriculture and Horticulture Departments. He advised the officials to launch massive awareness and publicity campaigns by circulating pamphlets on scientific farming methods, centres of market, use of proper quantity of fertilizers and pesticides.
