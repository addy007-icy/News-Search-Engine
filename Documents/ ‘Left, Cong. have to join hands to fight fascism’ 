Writer M. Mukundan has said that the Left parties have to join hands with the Congress at the national-level to fight fascist forces as the former on their own are not strong enough to take on such forces.Inaugurating a symposium organised by the District Congress Committee (DCC) here on Monday on ‘Fascism in contemporary India,’ Mr. Mukundan said that the Left alone could not be expected to fight fascism emerging in the country.Both the Left parties and the Congress should set aside their petty quarrels at a time when the spectre of fascism appeared in the country, he added. Noting that modern history showed good models of joint fight against fascist forces, he recalled that the United States and Russia, despite their political differences, had fought together to defeat Nazism and Fascism in Europe during the World War II.Writer P. Surendran in his address at the symposium said that for the people of the West there was no difference between Fascism/Nazism and Communism as they had killed millions of people and silenced dissenting voices.He also said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had emulated its militant organisational structure from Nazism.The RSS had never associated itself with the national movement, he pointed out. Exclusivism, a key feature of fascism, is the hallmark of the RSS, he added.DCC president K. Surendran presided. Former district panchayat president K.A. Sarala, Folklore Akademi chairman B. Mahmood Ahmed, A.P. Abdullakutty, MLA, and Suresh Babu Elayavur were among those who spoke at the symposium.
