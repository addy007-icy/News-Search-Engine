Sharing a tip to clear the Union Public Service Commission, a dream for thousands of IAS aspirants, topper Amrutesh Aurangabadkar, who cleared the exam when he was only 21, said reading The Hindu regularly was a sure way to success.Fondly reminiscing his tryst with the ‘dak edition’, as Mr Aurangabadkar and his friends used to call The Hindu , he said he began seriously studying the newspaper in 2009 soon after his graduation.Mr Auranbagadkar, now 25, made history of sorts and became an inspiration for others when he stood first in Maharashtra and was ranked 10th in the country after cracking the UPSC (mains) examination in 2012 in his maiden attempt.“Embrace the hoary adage that the editorials and foreign policy pieces in The Hindu are a must-read,” he said, speaking at the launch of the second edition of his book IAS@21 , written soon after he cleared his exams.The book was launched here at a programme organised by the Sankalp IAS Forum, in collaboration with The Hindu . The book, written in a lively and highly accessible style, is peppered with inspiring anecdotes and interspersed with a didactic approach towards clearing the IAS hurdle.Mr Aurangabadkar said he was indebted to the guidance from his elder sister, Chinmaya, who like him cleared the UPSC in her first attempt to enter the Indian Revenue Services in 2009.Mr Aurangabadkar stressed on the importance of selecting optional subjects of one’s interest, as they facilitated in-depth reading without the student having to labour under its weight. “Often one is told that there is a particular method to crack the exams only if one takes certain subjects. This is not always true. One should opt for subjects dear to one’s heart,” said Mr Aurangabadkar, who had Sociology and Philosophy as his ‘optionals’.He spoke to students on the benefits of cultivating reading habits, recalling how he joyfully devoured Chanakya’s political treatise The Arthashastra and books on Swami Vivekanananda’s philosophy while still at college.“It is a myth that clearing the UPSC is a speciality of students from the North, one that has been conclusively demolished over the past decade or so. In the past, it could also be a combination of lack of awareness coupled with the variety of alternative, and often, profitable careers in States such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, which may have led to an ostensible lack of interest in taking a shot at the exam,” said Mr Aurangabadkar.He said that now students in Maharashtra were as keen for a career in civil services and that there was no dearth of IAS coaching classes in the State.
