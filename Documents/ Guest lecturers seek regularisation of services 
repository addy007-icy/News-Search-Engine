Guest lecturers serving in government degree colleges launched an indefinite demonstration at Tipu Sultan Garden here on Thursday demanding regularisation of their services. They expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s “negligence” in addressing their problems.“Our main demand is that the government regularise our service and integrate us with regular teaching staff, just as it had done in 2003. The government should hike our pay to Rs. 25,000 a month as temporary measure till our services are regularised and ensure that the payment is made in the first week of every month. Three-month maternity leave with pay should be extended to women guest lecturers,” Sharanabasava Patil Joladahedagi, district president of guest lecturers’ association, said.
