Help develop interest in reading books among children and youth because they are lost in their mobile phones and the Internet, said K.D. Bhat after releasing a Kannada book, Brahmandada Dari, written by T.M. Subbaraya, at the Nemmadi Kutira in Sirsi recently, according to a release here on Monday. Children should learn the essence of values written in the ancient scriptures in view of the “lack of knowledge in our own epics” in today’s world, he said. Mr. Subbaraya spoke. V.P. Hegde welcomed the gathering.
