In what was termed by it as an instance in which “the police have plotted in unison to scuttle an investigation against a member of their own force portraying clear abuse of power (sic),” the State Police Complaints Authority (SPCA) has lambasted senior police officers for trying, in an orchestrated manner, to protect an assistant sub inspector of Enathu police station, Prabhakaran, accused by a housewife of assault and stealing.In an order critical of the force, K. Narayana Kurup, chairman of the authority, has instructed the State Police Chief to constitute a special investigation team to thoroughly investigate the case and file a charge sheet against the ASI.It also asked the ASI to pay Lalithammal and her husband Karthikeyan — the complainants and the ASI’s neighbours at Chunakara — a token compensation of Rs.25,000.The incident pertaining to the case occurred in October, 2012 when the ASI, along with a few others, had allegedly trespassed into the house of Lalithammal and assaulted her husband.This was done in retaliation for the couple’s son, an engineering student, and his friends allegedly blocking his way when he was riding a motorcycle.While the couple lodged a complaint with the police, this was not acted upon.Mr. Kurup, in his order, said that the police officers who had probed the case had turned the inquiry into a farce by absolving the ASI of all charges.“Dealing with such serious allegations of misconduct against a police officer, the Superintendent of Police, Alappuzha, or the Superintendent of Police, Pathanamthitta, as the case maybe, should have at least ensured that the enquiry be conducted by an independent agency and a responsible officer and not by officers associated with the same police station or division (sic),” he observed in the order, terming this as an attempt to ‘shield’ the ASI.The “grave miscarriage of justice” that the case demonstrated, he observed, would “erode the confidence of the public in the police.”Police Chief asked to set up SIT to probe ASI who allegedly assaulted a housewife and husband
