llegal abattoirs will make a killing in the city for some more time as the move to set up a modern unit has suffered a setback.There are no takers for the proposal for setting up a modern abattoir in the city even as the proposals for such units are progressing in Thrissur, Palakkad and Kollam districts. As many as two agencies have been shortlisted for the units in these districts. The abattoir proposals were being taken forward under the Partner Kerala programme of the State government.There have been complaints of illegal slaughtering taking place in many parts of the city. Most of the unauthorised units function in the West Kochi region.The illegal slaughtering of animals for meat poses serious health risks as there is no system to ensure that the animals used are healthy.The non-availability of sufficient land seems to have deterred the bidders from Kochi. A 45-cent holding, owned by the Kochi Corporation, is what the authorities had to offer to set up the plant in Kochi. It will require at least 2.5 to 3 acres of land for setting up the units. “Since no one has evinced interest in the Kochi plant, attention has been shifted to identifying a suitable holding for the unit,” authorities said.The original proposal was to set up the Rs.16 crore-plant on design-build-finance-operate-transfer mode. The input of the local body was to be in the form of the holding. It was suggested that the plant should have an installed capacity to handle 50 bovines and 25 small animals for an eight-hour shift. The project proponent also had to set up and operate an effluent treatment plant and rendering-cum-carcass utilisation plant of adequate capacity. Though the last date for submitting the application was extended, no one turned up for the Kochi plant, authorities said.
