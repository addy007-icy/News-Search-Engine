Signal jumping by motorists, mainly two-wheeler riders, is turning out to be a nuisance for the city’s traffic cops. Such incidents have been on the rise at almost all traffic junctions. With the Mysuru Traffic Police division short-staffed, the Traffic Department has hired the services of home guards to oversee traffic at the junctions.Perhaps, taking an easygoing view of their (home guards) presence, many motorists jump the red signal, causing confusion for other vehicle users, besides endangering safety of road users.Many vehicle users don’t wait for the signal to turn green. This is even causing problem to other road users, who are forced to flout the norm and move with those who jumped the signal.A senior police officer told The Hindu that there have been reports of rise in the number of signal jumping cases in recent times. The home guards manning the traffic junctions have been asked to note down the registration numbers of such vehicles and report the same to the respective stations to penalise them, he said. “The motorists must understand their safety and that of others before committing such an offence. It is not possible to catch every offender in the busy traffic,” the officer added.Staff crunchThe traffic division is facing a shortage of about 125 personnel at its five traffic police stations here. Those who were on deputation to the traffic division from the law and order division had been sent back to their parent division last year.The scarcity was overcome by hiring over 150 home guards, who at present supervise most traffic junctions.A few other traffic personnel have been deployed for the task of checking violations and penalising offenders.The recent recruits for the posts of constables, who are at present undergoing training, may be available in the next few months.“We are expecting that the vacant posts in the traffic division will be filled up soon by these new recruits. Once they are posted, we hope to curb such offences,” the officer said.A few traffic police personnel, deployed for traffic management, have been given pocket-size cameras to take pictures of those who violate road rules like riding without helmet and faulty number plates, among others.
