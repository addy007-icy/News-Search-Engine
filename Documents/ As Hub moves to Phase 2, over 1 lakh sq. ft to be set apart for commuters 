Over one lakh square feet area at Vyttila Mobility Hub will be set apart for use by bus, metro rail and ferry commuters, even as a decision has been taken to execute the second phase development works of the hub with private participation.Five lakh sq ft area will be set apart for commercial use.The Planning Board had recently approved Rs.363 crore works that would be done on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT)-basis by a private player who would be shortlisted soon.The hub has 27.12 acres of land, of which 2.12 acres would be occupied by Kochi Metro’s station and viaduct. Another 4.65 acres would be set apart as green space for trees and plants, while 48 cents of land houses a fuel station.These common spaces are apart from the one lakh sq ft on the ground floor of the upcoming phase two complex. Commercial development will be allowed only on the upper floors, official sources said.While norms will be fixed for developing common and other spaces, the private player can choose between having cellar or multi-tier parking for 1,000 cars, said the hub society’s MD, R. Girija. The common spaces will include bus bays, idle parking area for buses, kiosks, waiting rooms, toilets and rest rooms for bus crew.The Planning Board suggested private participation since the earlier proposal to generate 70 per cent cost as loan and 30 per cent from the State government for second phase had inherent risks.The private player will have to adhere to the hub society’s specifications in all aspects of design, while ensuring maximum revenue to the society. “It will be a win-win situation for both stakeholders,” Ms. Girija said.Speeding busesIn the meantime, hub society officials are expected to convene a meeting of police officials and representatives of bus operators to prevent speeding and rash driving within the hub premises and in the Vyttila Junction-Mobility Hub corridor.Pedestrians have to risk their life while crossing from the hub’s western end to the eastern portion where bus bays are located, since buses, especially private ones, compete with one another to call at the bays despite presence of police personnel at the police-aid post in the premises.There were instances of passengers suffering grievous injury after being knocked down by buses, giving rise to demand for a foot overbridge.
