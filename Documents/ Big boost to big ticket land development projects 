Stalled for years due to legal and other reasons, two crucial development projects for Mumbai – the Dharavi redevelopment and Salt Pan development – have been set in motion by the Devendra Fadnavis government. While the Chief Minister on Wednesday cleared the bid document for Dharavi redevelopment in central Mumbai, the State is likely to submit to Centre the master plan for development of salt pan land spreading over 13,000 acres across the State.Mr Fadnavis on Wednesday chaired a crucial meeting to discuss the Rs 15,000-crore Dharavi Redevelopment Project, and cleared the bid structuring for the project, paving the way for the tendering process within next two months. The BJP-led government has increased the size of the tenements under the project from 300 to 350 square feet. The ambitious project which will redevelop prime piece of land adjoining the Bandra Kurla Complex had been stalled since 2004 over contentious issue of the size of tenements and appointment of project consultants.Similarly, the plan to open up stretches of Salt Pan land for development in landlocked Mumbai has also been stuck in complex litigation. The government had appointed the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to prepare a master plan to enable development of mass housing projects. The MMRDA is giving finishing touches to a master plan, which is likely to be submitted to the Centre within the next one month, sources said.In August 2015, the Fadnavis government had initiated the process of using these land pockets of salt pan land to build mass housing projects, primarily for Economically Weaker Sections and Lower Income Groups. The master plan will map the land and provide an estimate of how much of this land can be developed.The salt pan land pockets are located on Mumbai’s eastern water front, far suburbs of Vasai, Virar and Palghar districts and are estimated to be around 5,300 acres.
