In a jolt to a paralysed Indian grandfather’s bid to seek justice, an American police officer who brutally assaulted him has been acquitted by a U.S. court after two mistrials could not establish his guilt beyond doubt.Judge Madeline Hughes Haikala threw out the case against Alabama police officer Eric Parker, who faced up to 10 years in prison for using excessive force against 58-year-old Sureshbhai Patel in the February 6 incident last year.Parker knocked Patel down to the ground when he was walking on a lane near his son’s home in Alabama, an incident that left him partially paralysed and angered the Indian-American community. Judge Haikala on Wednesday filed a 92-page opinion. “The Government has had two full and fair chances to obtain a conviction; it will not have another.” she said.Parker still faces a state charge of misdemeanour assault in Limestone County. “The result in this case is by no means satisfying. Hindsight brings clarity to a calamity,” the judge said. “Mr Patel’s celebrated arrival in this country to begin a new life with his son was interrupted in two tragic minutes. If Mr. Parker or Mr. Patel could take that time back, both would surely do things differently and avoid the events that have forever changed both of their lives.”“Mr. Patel had — and has — just as much right to be free from excessive force as every citizen of this country. He is welcome here, and it is appropriate to grieve his injury. However, that injury, standing alone, does not provide the basis for a criminal judgement against Mr. Parker,” she said.
