Public sector telecom service provider BSNL on Thursday formally launched its high-speed mobile data (Wi-Fi) offloading service in the State at 20 popular spots, saying it would be thrice as fast as a 4G service.BSNL 2G and 3G users with an active data package can set their handsets to access the Wi-Fi service automatically at the designated hot spots at no extra charge. Non-BSNL users can also benefit partially with Wi-Fi Internet services. (These are outside the few Wi-Fi spots offered by the State government.)BSNL Chairman and Managing Director Anuran Shrivastava said: “We missed the voice [mobile phones] bus for want of modern equipment when the segment was taking off a few years back [and also due to lack of] spectrum. BSNL is determined not to lose the growing area of [mobile] data.”Currently, MDO service is available in 10 spots in Bengaluru such as Cubbon Park, M.S. Buildings, a few telephone exchanges, the Bengaluru and Mangaluru airports; Hampi Virupaksha Temple in Ballari and in Hubballi.The offloading to Wi-Fi, Mr. Shrivastava said, would enhance data connectivity and bring back subscribers and revenue to BSNL.The State circle generated revenue of Rs. 2,400 crore out of the company’s total turnover of Rs. 28,000 crore last fiscal and is expected to turn profitable in 2016-17.Initiated in Varanasi two years back, MDO service is now available at 700 hot spots across the country, such as the Taj Mahal and other tourist spots, it is expected to reach 2,500 hotspots by April and 40,000 venues in two years, Mr. Shrivastava said.BSNL is investing around Rs. 6,000 crore over three years to offer the service nationwide. It has tied up with QuadGen Wireless Solutions to market and maintain the service for five years.
