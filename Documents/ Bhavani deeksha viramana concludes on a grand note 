The five-day Bhavani deeksha viramana (relinquishment of the deeksha) concluded on a grand note at Sri Durga Malleswara Swamivarla Devasthanam on Monday.The temple priests performed ‘poornahuti’ at yagasaala near Sivalayam on Indrakeeladri at around 11 a.m. It marked the end of Bhavani Deeksha relinquishment this year. Amidst chanting of Vedic hymns, the temple priests offered a silk sari, sandalwood pieces, ghee, flowers and fruits to the ‘homam’, and ‘aaseerwachanam’ (blessings) were given to the devotees.Thousands of Bhavani devotees, after taking a holy dip in the Krishna River, made a beeline for the Kanaka Durga temple since midnight and offered special pujas to the goddess to mark the relinquishment. Circumambulation of the Indrakeeladri is mandatory (‘giri pradakshina’), for the devotees who took Bhavani deeksha.‘Giri Pradakshana’ was done by some devotees even on Monday and the roads were painted red with devotees turning up in the traditional dress. The vicinity of Indrakeeladri reverberated with chants and slogans, ‘Bhavani Mata ki jai', ‘Jai Bhavani Jai Jai Bhavani’ as Bhavanis stormed in large numbers to relinquish their ‘deeksha’.A huge ‘homagundam’ constructed on Arjuna Veedhi was used by the devotees to deposit their ‘Irumudi’ that they brought carrying on their head and walking all the way from their houses or chosen destinations.
