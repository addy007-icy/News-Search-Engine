As the crisis brews, the new garbage tenders that were billed to overhaul solid waste management in the city have not got the anticipated response. Of the 95 ward-wise tenders that were floated, bids have been received only for 38. Of these, 29 wards received only one bid each.On Tuesday, City Development Minister K.J. George admitted that the response to the new tenders was poor. This, he believed, could be due to the stringent norms and tender conditions. However, both BBMP officials and solid waste management experts say that the new tenders cannot be compared with the old ones, which mainly focussed on the transport aspect.New tenders differentThe new tenders are completely different, as the emphasis is on primary and secondary collection of segregated waste and ensures better monitoring and accountability.Kalpana Kar, member of the solid waste management expert committee, told The Hindu that there has been a big shift in the tender conditions because of which there could be some resistance.“The new tenders will hopefully bring in some professionalism, as benchmarks and performance indicators have been set. We need people, who understand this need for change, to invest and participate and show others that it is doable,” she said.Subodh Yadav, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management), concurred and pointed out that the new tenders have also specified the basic amenities required, put in place a monitoring mechanism, besides including several measures for the welfare of pourakarmikas. Ruling out the possibility of relaxing norms, he said that if that is done, issues of waste not being picked up regularly, black spots and harassment of pourakarmikas would continue.Way ahead: short-term tendersThe Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike may soon float short-term tenders for the 57 wards which did not receive any bid for solid waste management under the new tender conditions.Subodh Yadav, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management), told The Hindu that the civic body is evaluating the bids received for 38 wards.“The evaluation of technical bids may be completed in a couple of days, following which we will know if the single bids can be accepted. Else, we will call for short-term tenders for such wards,” Mr. Yadav said.This could bedue to thestringent norms and tender conditions
