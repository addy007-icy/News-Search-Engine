YSR Congress president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has called on former Union Minister and film director Dasari Narayana Rao at the latter’s residence here on Tuesday.Though the meeting was described as a courtesy call, sources in the YSRC said the meeting was part of the political strategy to endear the party to Kapus. The meeting comes in the light of reports that the Kapus, considered a strong vote base for the YSRC, stayed away from the party during the last general elections.Sources said Mr. Dasari Narayana Rao enjoyed the support of a major section of the Kapu community that did not support MP and actor Chiranjeevi and his brother Pawan Kalyan. The meeting was aimed at sending a signal to Mr. Dasari’s supporters that the YSRC considered Kapus one of its strong bases in the coastal Andhra. Emerging out of the meeting, Mr. Dasari said he had close rapport with the family of former Chief Minister late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. He appreciated Mr. Jagan as a leader who was struggling for the people’s cause and hoped that the YSRC president would grow much stronger in the coming days.
