An old rusted traffic light post came crashing down, just missing the vehicle carrying former Brazilian football star Ronaldinho on Monday morning near Kozhikode.CPI(M) legislator A. Pradeep Kumar said that after completing his morning engagement when Ronaldinho came to visit a state-run school, his car was coming out from the school.“As soon as his car came out from the school, an old rusted traffic light post fell before his vehicle. Seeing it, he smiled and the car sped away, negotiating the fallen post,” said Mr. Kumar.Ronaldinho is in Kozhikode after being named as the brand ambassador of the Sait Nagjee Football Tournament that is being revived after a gap of 21 years.Even though the tournament is to begin on February 5, the organisers have brought in the two-time World Player of the Year to ensure that they get a very strong pre-event publicity.
