Zonal officers of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) came under fire at a Transferable Development Rights (TDR) review meeting held on Tuesday as only 32 roads have been widened out of 216 announced nearly a decade ago.Mayor B.S. Manjunath Reddy squarely blamed ‘unresponsive’ officials. He pointed to the ‘slow progress’ in 13 roads which are being widened. He directed zonal officials to send notices to land losers and convince them to part with land under the TDR scheme. Out of the 216 roads announced in 2005-06, 92 are in ‘core areas’ of the city. The Mayor directed officials to revisit the roads to ascertain where widening is necessary.
