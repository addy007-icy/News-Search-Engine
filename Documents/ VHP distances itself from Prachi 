The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has distanced itself from the Hindutva leader Sadhvi Prachi, who has courted controversy with her statements in the wake of the killing of a VHP worker at Agra. “The VHP wants to make it clear again that Sadhvi Prachi is neither its leader, nor a spokesperson, nor an office-bearer... Her statements should not be linked to the VHP,” its international joint general secretary Surendra Jain said.
