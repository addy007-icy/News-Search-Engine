In an attempt to expand the reach of its entrepreneurial assistance scheme, the Kerala State Welfare Corporation for Forward Communities (Samunnathi) has joined hands with the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) to launch a small and medium enterprises (SMEs) loan for the economically backward among forward communities.Samunnathi chairman B. Rajasekharan and IDBI deputy general manager K.B. Rangaraj exchanged the memorandum of associations at a function held here on Thursday.The loan component will be the responsibility of the bank while Samunnathi will offer a onetime loan subsidy of 5 per cent, not exceeding Rs.30,000 for loans up to Rs.6 lakh.The loan will be available to start SMEs, take up agriculture initiatives and purchase cabs and autorickshaws. Loans under Kisan Credit Card scheme, poultry and dairy industries are also covered. Loans up to Rs.1 lakh for microenterprises under the Kisan Credit Card and loans up to Rs.10 lakh under Saral Vyapar Scheme are exempted from surety.Samunnathi aims at extending the subsidy scheme to around 200 beneficiaries who pay 12 instalments without fault.The Corporation has also introduced virtual banking system enabling repayment by beneficiaries from the banks where they hold accounts. “We are fully aware that we cannot meet the entire demand for assistance with a tie-up with IDBI alone. Hence, we are planning to approach more banks for similar joint initiatives,” said Mr. Rajasekharan.Earlier, the Corporation used to extend entrepreneurial assistance under its Samrambha scheme to self-help groups only. The demand for assistance to individuals prompted it to join hands with IDBI.
