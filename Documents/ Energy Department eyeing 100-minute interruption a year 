Having won the global acclaim for efficiency in the power sector, the Energy Department of Andhra Pradesh is studying the best practices for meeting the international norms of less than 100 minutes of interruption per year and maximum 10 outages per feeder per year.The annual interruption, according to official sources, is at present for more than a few hundred minutes, which is better than in many other States. It will bolster the Stateâ€™s chances to attract investments over and above what was mobilised at the CII Partnership Summit held at Visakhapatnam recently. The energy sector alone received investment proposals worth Rs.1.38 lakh crore.Energy Secretary Ajay Jain stated in a press release that a top priority was given for interruption-free quality power supply to industrial zones such as Sri City, Krishnapatnam, Visakhapatnam and Kakinada to boost economic growth.Mr. Jain further stated that A.P has overcome the power deficit of about 22 million units per day and achieved surplus in a span of just one year.
