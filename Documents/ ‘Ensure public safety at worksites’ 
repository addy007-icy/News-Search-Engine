A day after a motorcyclist died after falling into an under-construction storm water drain on Chamaraja Double Road here, the Mysore City Corporation (MCC) has issued directions to its staff to ensure that all safety precautions are in place at its worksites.Though the work on storm water drain was being carried out by the Public Works Department, the MCC, however, said it would ask the department to install more barricades at the worksite (which comes under MCC limits).“The road was closed for traffic as work was being carried out. However, the department will be asked to put up more warning signage and barricades for the safety of the public,” MCC Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath told The Hindu.He said barricades had been placed at almost all sites where the MCC was carrying out works.ProtestThe death had triggered protest demanding adequate safety measures for the public at work sites, including on Chamaraja Double Road. In the past too, a motorcyclist had died after falling into an open ditch on the outer ring road.Locals say that the authorities concerned should put up more warning boards and barrier tapes with the words ‘work in progress’ at the work sites. At the same time, road users should also take caution and avoid incomplete road stretches, they said.
