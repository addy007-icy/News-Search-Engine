: Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) of the State Road Transport Corporation was chock-a-block on Sunday with additional crowd of commuters.The major Andhra festival of Sankranti culminating in a weekend contributed to the teeming multitudes frantically scurrying from counter to the other to buy tickets. Cashing in on the inflated customer size, the RTC authorities are also charging extra fares for special buses introduced to clear extra rush. Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of the Corporation N. Sambasiva Rao went around the bus station and interacted with a few passengers for a first-hand account of the passenger amenities.He said the RTC had introduced additional services for the convenience of the people and not with a profit-motive. Admitting that the corporation was collecting 50 per cent extra fares on special services, Mr. Sambasiva Rao asserted that yet, it was less than what private bus operators were charging.
