With the Labour Minister Parameshwar Naik reportedly admitting that he got a woman police officer transferred for not taking his call has sparked off a political storm, with the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party urging Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to sack the Minister.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, BJP State spokesperson S. Suresh Kumar pointed out that the Minister had earlier denied his role in the transfer.Even the DG & IGP had maintained that it was not a transfer, but an instance of sending the officer on official duty (OOD). However, the video clip by a TV channel showed the Minister declaring at a meeting of the Congress workers that he got the woman officer transferred for not waiting to receive his call.Mr. Suresh Kumar said compassion and patience are expected from a Labour Minister as he has to understand the difficulties of the working class.“If he does not have patience to understand the problems of a woman police officer, how will he understand the problems of ordinary labourers?” he said.He also urged the DG & IGP, who took a different stand on the episode earlier, to clarify his position now.
