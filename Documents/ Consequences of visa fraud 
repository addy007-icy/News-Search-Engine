Samuel Darling, Regional Manager for the UK’s Immigration Enforcement Risk & Liaison Overseas Network, said, “We are aware of a number of travel agents across India who encourage applicants to submit fraudulent documents or passports that have been tampered with as part of their visa application and it’s important that people know the consequences of being caught, before they agree. Those found guilty are not only refused a visa, their passport could be revoked, they could face 10-year travel ban from the UK and America and Australia.”
