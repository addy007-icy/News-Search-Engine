With two big hits to her credit, Deepika Padukone stole the limelight in 2015 and in 2016 her eyes are on Hollywood. She is debuting with XXX:The Return of Xander Cage. “I am excited and nervous at the same time. However, most importantly, I feel proud to be a part of the film where I can flaunt my ethnicity. They have roped me because of my background and so I hope that I do well in this movie and make everyone proud,” said Deepika on the sidelines of the launch of Tissot’s ‘classic timepieces – Chemin des Tourelles in New Delhi.With each film the model-turned-actor makes a style statement. She credits her makeup artist, stylists and directors for each look that she supports. “They are really the minds behind my looks. The cat-eye liner in Om Shanti Om, the kurtis in Love Aaj Kal and the jhumka and lehnga in Ram-Leela, all these looks became famous because of them.” She mentioned her fan-girl moment as how she herself owned different coloured headbands after watching Kajol in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.From a show-piece to the centre of attention, the 30-year-old actor has come a long way. Recently, she won the best actor award for Piku at Filmfare Awards. “To be competitive with myself and to keep setting new benchmarks for myself is something that I have worked for. My aim is to keep improving myself,” summed up Deepika.
