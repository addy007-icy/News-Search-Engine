Prominent Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad has termed as a “joke” the Saudi Arabian leadership of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) after prominent Shia and Sunni clerics were >executed in that country last week.Speaking exclusively to The Hindu, Maulana Jawad, considered the most influential Shia cleric in India (Shias, according to figures from 2005-06, comprise 25-31% of the Muslim population in India), said that international pressure had to be brought to bear to remove Saudi Arabia from even being a member of the UNHRC.“There is no democracy in Saudi Arabia and there is an institutionalised crushing of dissent. Not only was (Shia cleric) Nimr al-Nimr executed, so was Sunni cleric Fahris al Zahrani for expressing dissent, and the latter has been branded as Al Qaeda, which is doubtful,” he said. “Saudi Arabia has a history of crushing dissent brutally and their headship of the UNHRC is a joke. The international community should apply sanctions against Saudi Arabia and remove them from the UNHRC,” he said. The executions have set off a diplomatic war between Saudi Arabia and Iran and have resulted in the severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Maulana Jawad, however, does not have any hope of lobbying the Indian government over the issue. “The Indian government is handicapped because of India’s oil requirements. They will never take a strong stance against Saudi Arabia,” he said.Shias in Lucknow play an important role in electing the MP from the seat, earlier represented by former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, and now by Home Minister Rajnath Singh. Mr. Vajpayee and the BJP have enjoyed good terms with the community in the past.
