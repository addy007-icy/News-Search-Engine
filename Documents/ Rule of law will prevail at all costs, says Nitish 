Criticised for the “deteriorating” law and order situation in the State, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday said the rule of law would be maintained in the State at all costs. Following the murder of a jeweller on Saturday morning in the State capital, the Opposition parties attacked the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance for its failure to contain the rise in crime.“One should not stress on isolated incidents …we’ve taken stern measures to curb organised crimes…there is rule of law and it will be preserved in the State at all costs,” Mr. Kumar told journalists in Patna. “No laxity on the part of the policemen will be tolerated,” he said.Mr. Kumar said he had taken up the Darbhanga incident, in which two engineers were recently killed over extortion demand, “as a challenge.”On Saturday, a Patna-based jeweller Ravi Kant too was shot dead over extortion demand.The gang of extortionists reportedly demanded Rs. 10 lakh and a gold chain from the trader.“The fear of the return of jungle raj appears to be true in Bihar. Under the dominance of the numerically-strong RJD, it appears the Nitish government has lost the will to take on the criminals,” State BJP leader Sushil Kumar said.
