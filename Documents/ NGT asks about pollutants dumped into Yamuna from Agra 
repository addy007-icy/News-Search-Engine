In an attempt to control the dumping of pollutants into the Yamuna from Agra, the National Green Tribunal has taken note of construction material and debris being dumped into the river by the city.The tribunal has directed the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam and the Agra Municipal Corporation to inform it about the total sewage discharge and the quantity of untreated waste being released into the river.Taking note of the fact that many colonies in Agra lack sewer connection, the green panel directed the Agra Development Authority (ADA) to identify such areas and remove construction material being dumped in front of these residential colonies.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also directed the ADA to supervise the cleaning of construction material and debris.“The Jal Nigam and Municipal Corporation, Agra, shall file a compliance report showing total sewage discharge from the city and how much of it is being treated and the amount which is being put into the river untreated.The Jal Nigam, ADA, shall also identify the area having no sewage connection,” the bench said.The matter has been posted for hearing on February 23.In September last year, the tribunal had issued a showcause notice to 10 residential colonies of Agra for discharging untreated sewage.It had also asked them to explain why a fine of Rs. 1.41 crore not be imposed on them for polluting the Yamuna.Earlier, the tribunal had imposed a fine of Rs. 1 lakh on the Agra Municipal Corporation for dumping waste on the Yamuna floodplains, noting that the civic body had failed to perform its duty and protect the environment.
