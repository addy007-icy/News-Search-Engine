: On the heels of launching its maiden cell to be dedicated solely to countering cyber crime, the Noida police on Saturday kicked-off a two-day training module for its personnel here.As many as 50 personnel ranging from Constables to Inspector-level officials participated in a session on cyber security exercise. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kiran S also attended the session on Saturday; the next module is scheduled for Sunday. “So far, our personnel were not adequately equipped to deal with complaints related to crime perpetrated on social media or the internet but all that will change in the days to come,” the SSP said.“From being equipped to gathering digital evidence to retrieving deliberately deleted files and analysing dump data – the Noida Police will soon be able to assist complainants and victims of cyber crime, e-commerce frauds and even cyber bullying,” he added.
