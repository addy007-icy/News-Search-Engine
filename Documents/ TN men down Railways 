Tamil Nadu overcame a nervy start to put it across Indian Railways 71-44 in their opening fixture of the 66th Senior National basketball championship, held at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium indoor courts here on Saturday.The two strong sides were slow off the blocks, with Railways opening the scoring after four minutes. The players eventually got into the groove, and the first-half finished 31-30 in favour of Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu then raced ahead in the third-quarter, with its centres Rikin Pethani (18 points, 14 rebounds) and Annadurai Aravind (15 pts) stamping their authority.Pethani took advantage of some lax marking by his opposite number, Akashdeep Hazra, emerging the clear winner in the battle of the big men. Aravind gave Pethani able company in the paint, allowing the side to gain an assailable 60-38 lead by the end of the third-quarter. Shooting guard Pratham Singh (14 pts), when into called into action, pulled the trigger to good effect.In another fixture, point guard Prakash Mishra recorded an incredible 47 points to guide Madhya Pradesh to a 78-65 win over West Bengal. Prakash sank eight of his 10 three-point attempts.In the women’s section, favourites Chhattisgarh suffered a shock 67-54 loss to Kerala. P.S.
