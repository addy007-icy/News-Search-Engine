Delhi Police Sub-Inspector Vijender Verma who had shot his paramour before committing suicide on Sunday had left behind a note in which he has alleged that the murdered woman, Nikita, had been extorting money from him for the past three years.In the note, Vijender also mentions that for the past two weeks he was planning to murder her and then kill himself because of the professional and personal problems he was facing due to her alleged blackmailing, the last straw being a departmental enquiry ordered against him for taking unwarranted leaves.The note adds that to pay off Nikita, he had to borrow Rs. 5 lakh and had to evade creditors which had resulted in absence from work.In the note recovered from the pocket of his uniform that Vijender was wearing, he documents how Nikita had started blackmailing him since she came to know about his marital status, something he initially concealed from her.“He claimed that she asked for Rs. 3 to Rs. 5 lakh and threatened to register a rape case against Verma every two months. She had even approached the Joint Commissioner of the range with a complaint in November last year when Verma had refused to pay the money,” said a source.In the list of those allegedly blackmailed by Nikita, were her former editor Pramod who was jailed in 2014 and at least eight others from whom she used to extort money by threatening to register rape cases against them. She was also helped by two of her siblings, the purported note goes on to add.The note ends with the deceased cop making an appeal to his mother not to cry over his death as “every one has to die someday.”New claimTalking to The Hindu , Nikita’s father Susheel Chauhan alleged that the murder was pre-planned by her estranged husband Parvesh and employer Pramod. “We have submitted a complaint with the local police asking them to book the two in a case of murder as they had ganged up with the cop to eliminate my daughter,” said Mr. Chauhan.However, when asked if Vijender was part of the conspiracy, why would he kill himself, Mr. Chauhan said that was for the police to look into.
