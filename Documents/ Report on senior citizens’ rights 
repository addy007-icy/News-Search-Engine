V.K. Beeran, former Advocate General and Special Officer deputed by the government for setting up a Regulatory Board for protecting the rights of senior citizens, has submitted his interim report to Social Justice Minister M.K. Muneer. Mr. Beeran handed over the report to Dr. Muneer at his official residence here on Tuesday. The commission has made a lot of suggestions for settling complaints of senior citizens and pointed out that Revenue Divisional Officers, who were the implementing officers for settling issues of senior citizens, were unable to intervene in issues on time because of their heavy workload. The commission has suggested that Deputy Collectors be engaged for the same instead of RDOs.
