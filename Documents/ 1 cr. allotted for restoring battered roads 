This along with the list of works were placed before the council recently.However, patchworks will be taken up for a total length of 1.8 km, with the length of selected stretches ranging from 130 m to 300 m.However, a number of councilors are unhappy with the selection of stretches. They say that there are worse roads that need immediate attention.Stretches identified“With this Rs. one crore, the Corporation has identified stretches in areas that were not flooded in the November rains. Roads in parts of Kazhinjur, Dharapadavedu, Muthamizh Nagar, Bharathi Nagar and V.G. Rao Nagar are badly battered roads, and are in dire need of repair. But officials are saying this is only the first phase works, and more roads will be covered later,” a councillor said.He added that roads around Kazhinjur Lake were damaged after the water body was filled up, and surplus water overflowed onto the roads. Another councillor said that instead of allocating Rs. nine to Rs. 15 lakh for each of the works on the identified stretches, the fund could have been divided and distributed for 20 to 25 wards.“This way, each of the 20 or 25 wards could have been given Rs. three to five lakh to take up patchwork on roads that need immediate repair works. Most of the roads identified are concentrated in Katpadi side. Motorists are finding it extremely difficult to travel on many rain battered stretches where repair works should be done at the earliest,” he said.He said the National Highways department should take up measures to repair damaged portions of the arterial Anna Salai.An official said the government will next provide funds for permanent restoration works of rain battered stretches.The present fund was to take up patchwork on highly damaged roads.
