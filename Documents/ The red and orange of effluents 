The tabulated data on the Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) on the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board’s (MPCB’s) website has more orange and red zones of pollution levels than safe levels.The CEPTs, located in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporations in Mumbai’s surrounding districts, test the pollution levels of the effluents discharged in the local rivers, after they are treated at the plants.According to the MPCB’s latest data, released on Monday, effluents from 16 of the 24 CETPs are categorised in the orange zone for having BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) levels way above the standard prescribed levels of 30 mg/l. BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material in a water sample.The Additional Ambernath CETP located in Thane district that empties the effluents in the local nullah which leads to the Waldhuni river, which further leads to the Ulhas creek is the most highly polluted in terms of its BOD levels. Its BOD levels are 410 mg/l just below the danger mark of 500 mg/l.The Ambernath CETP also falls in the red zone for high levels of COD (chemical oxygen demand) – measurement of the oxygen-depletion capacity of a water sample contaminated with organic waste matter. The level of COD at the Ambernath CETP is 968 mg/l, which is highly above the prescribed limit of 250 mg/l.Another plant which is in the COD red zone is the Dombivli CETP, which discharges effluents in the Bhopar nullah, leading to the Ulhas creek. The COD level here is 776 mg/l.“Despite repeated court orders and directives, the situation on the ground has not changed. There is no monitoring mechanism for the discharge of effluents in the rivers. Just by displaying the results, the MPCB cannot escape taking stringent measures to check the pollution level. About 90 per cent of the data they put up every 15 days is either in the orange or red category. For a majority of the cases, the pollution levels always exceed the prescribed limits,” said activist Godfrey Pimenta.Effluents from 16 of the 24 CETPs are in the orange zone indicating BOD above the prescribed levels
