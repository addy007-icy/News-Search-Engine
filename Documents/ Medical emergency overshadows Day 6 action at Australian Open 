The Australian Open tennis championships were rocked late on Saturday when Andy Murray’s father-in-law Nigel Sears collapsed during a match at Rod Laver Arena, overshadowing the World No. 2’s advance to the fourth round.Sears, Ana Ivanovic’s former coach, collapsed while watching the Serb’s third-round clash against Madison Keys, prompting medical staff to rush to the 58-year-old’s aid.Adding to the surreal atmosphere at Melbourne Park, Briton Murray was oblivious to the unfolding drama as he battled Portugal’s Joao Sousa in the neighbouring Margaret Court Arena.Play was suspended for an hour at Rod Laver Arena, as Sears received treatment before being fitted with breathing apparatus and carried from the stadium on a stretcher.He was taken to hospital for further treatment and was being examined by a cardiologist, organisers said.A teary-eyed Ivanovic was eventually led back to centre court to continue her match against Keys and although the Serb fought hard she fell 4-6 6-4 6-4.“Obviously it was a tough match,” Ivanovic said in a statement after declining post-match media commitments.“I really wanted to win and have a chance to come back... Obviously a little bit disappointed.”Murray completed a 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over 32nd seed Sousa and was led straight from the court by an official rather than conduct the usual courtside interview.In an unnerving coincidence, Ivanovic’s second-round match was also suspended after a spectator fell down the stairs at the same show court on Thursday.Murray also skipped the post-match media conference and the Scot’s only comment was confined to his match. “It was tricky. I didn’t feel great,” he said in a statement. “It was good to get through that one.”The medical emergency overshadowed the action on day six which saw Spanish third seed Garbine Muguruza dumped out of the tournament and Victoria Azarenka given a huge boost in her bid to win a third title at Melbourne Park.The 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka also reached the last 16, staying on track for a blockbuster semifinal against Murray.Muguruza dumpedMuguruza, rated one of the few women capable of threatening champion Serena Williams, slumped out at the hands of unseeded Czech Barbora Strycova, her 6-3, 6-2 loss punching a hole in the draw.But the path to a dream final against Williams seems laid out for 14th seed Azarenka, who beat Japanese qualifier Naomi Osaka 6-1, 6-1.
