The Tenth Pay Commission, headed by retired Justice C.N, Ramachandran Nair, has recommended separate group health insurance scheme for State government employees and pensioners to help them meet the mounting health bills.Currently, employees are reimbursed the cost of medical expenses and hospitalisation subject to certain conditions. The commission, which was given the task of examining the viability of introducing a new health package and insurance scheme, studied the schemes in several States including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra with their own variations. The commission has recommended a group insurance scheme which would share risks, which would lead to reduction in premium payments.The commission has suggested that the scheme can be titled as Kerala Government Medical Insurance Scheme for Employees and Kerala Government Medical Insurance Scheme for Pensioners. The scheme will be mandatory for all employees covered under the Kerala Government Servantsâ€™ Medical Insurance Attendance Rules, 1960.As for its funding, the scheme would draw it from collection of premium from employees and pensioners, who would be in a better liquidity position to contribute towards the premium amount in view of the hike in pay and prerequisites.Stating that no government subsidy would be required for the proposal, the commission has suggested hat the government may set apart 50 per cent of the budget provision (currently estimated at Rs.61.05 crore) towards its contribution towards premium payments. The government will have to bear the cost of paying premium upfront which may be around Rs. 40 crores.The commission has recommended Rs.2 lakh per annum as the insured amount. Fifty per cent of the budget provision for medical reimbursement may be set apart for OP treatment and the remaining 50 per cent to settle claims over the insured amounts of Rs.2 lakh.The commission has formulated a detailed proposal on the health insurance scheme that includes issues related to cashless facility, besides calculating on its own the low claim discount ratio and high claim loading ratio that basically decides the margins for the insurance companies. The Commission has also suggested entrusting a public sector insurance company to run the scheme, preferably through the State Insurance Department.The scheme will be mandatory for all employees covered under the medical insurance rules.
