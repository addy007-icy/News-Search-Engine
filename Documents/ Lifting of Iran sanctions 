The United States lifting economic sanctions against Iran is a positive development for the Iranian economy. (“U.S. lifts sanctions on Iran”, Jan.18). This comes as a whiff of fresh air at a time when West Asia is embroiled in a bloody conflict and battered with terrorism of the Islamic State (IS). The move is also a clear testament to effectiveness of diplomacy and dialogue over military confrontation in resolving controversial issues at the international level. U.S President Obama deserves special praise for his persistent engagement with Iran, with a clear intent to break the impasse surrounding its clandestine nuclear programme. The triumph of diplomacy has now raised the hopes for durable peace and stability.M. Jeyaram,Sholavandan, Tamil NaduIt is indeed a historic deal for both the U.S. and Iran as the latter has been brought back into the international economy. The nuclear deal marks a victory for peace and humanity. Though Iran has historically been opposed to the U.S., it no longer wants to keep itself isolated from the rest of the world. Sanctions have taken a toll on the common Iranian, as they have caused high inflation and severe economic stress. The government of Iran and its President Hassan Rouhani need to be applauded for taking the bold step of engaging with the country’s erstwhile foe.J.P. Reddy,Nalgonda, TelanganaThe lifting of sanctions has come as a New Year gift to Iran, reeling under economic difficulties. It is a huge diplomatic victory, both for the U.S. administration under Barack Obama and the Iranian regime under Hassan Rouhani. Though some countries like Israel still doubt Iran’s real intentions, the nuclear deal and its implementation can be viewed as a positive step towards global peace. It can also be seen as a realisation that the piling up of deadly nuclear weapons will only isolate nations.Gigi Mohan,Hyderabad
