“If the agricultural sector has to be strengthened then agriculture must be given industry status. The BJP government in Rajasthan must gather the courage to do that,” said Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee president Sachin Pilot here on Sunday.Such a bold move would bring immense relief to the farmers of Rajasthan since agriculture would then encompass loan exemption, insurance, facility for taking loans, and access to markets. It would also lead to various methods of investments, Mr. Pilot said.The Congress leader had claimed that over 60 farmers had committed suicide in Rajasthan in 2015 as their crop was destroyed due to excessive rainfall. He said over 10 lakh farmers were still awaiting compensation from the Vasundhara Raje government.Dalit officer caseMr. Pilot claimed that the Raje government was anti-Dalit and alleged that it was victimising Dalit IAS officer Umrao Salodia on the basis of caste.
