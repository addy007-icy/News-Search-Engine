Research theses are an important source of knowledge and researchers should ensure that their theses contained accurate and comprehensive information on the subject, Karnatak University chief librarian S.B. Patil, has said.Inaugurating a one-week long workshop on ‘Research thesis writing skills’ at the Karnatk Univerity’s Human resource Development Centre here on Monday, he said that it was essential for researchers to meticulously collect primary information and do field work to understand the ground reality.The objective behind the academic research would be realised only when the outcome of the research received wider acceptance and it was used to address issues haunting the society. As preparing thesis was also a specialised skill, youngsters needed to be trained properly, Mr. Patil said.The centre’s in-charge director Harish Ramaswamy said that emphasis should also be given on the publication of research works to make it available for the general public and decision makers. The researcher should show keen interest in identifying these problems and give them a solution. The research work should help administration and development, he added.Research students from social science, anthropology, history, political science, law and education are taking part in the workshop.
