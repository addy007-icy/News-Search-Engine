Watch lovers, attention! This will be your last chance to buy an iconic HMT watch, that was once a pride possession for many, before watches by private manufacturers flooded the Indian market. Though HMT Watches Ltd. has discontinued industrial production of watches, it has an unsold inventory of nearly six lakh watches. It intends to sell these watches by holding special melas across the country in the coming months, HMT sources said. Over 40 HMT showrooms, in various state capitals, were shut down recently, leaving no mechanism for the sale of these watches. In Bengaluru, one can buy these watches from outlets in HMT Bhavan on Ballari Road, General Post Office, HMT Watch Factory, Jalahalli and M.G. Road.
