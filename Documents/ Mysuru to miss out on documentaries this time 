There will be no screening of documentaries at the eight edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) in Mysuru. Reason: the number of screens designated to show films as part of the festival is less in Mysuru than Bengaluru, the other host city. While, films will be shown at 11 screens in Bengaluru, only four screens in Mysuru will be used for the festival.Documentaries listed under the categories—Climate Change and Drought, Indian Currents, International Currents, Retrospective Films and Students’ Documentary Shorts — will be screened at the Orion Mall in Bengaluru. Also, the world premiere of four Kannada films – Big Tree,Alemaariya Atma Kathe, Arivinamane and Actor – will not happen for the same reason.
