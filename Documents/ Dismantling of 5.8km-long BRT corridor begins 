The dismantling of the nearly eight-year-old Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor in south Delhi has begun.The Delhi government had taken the decision to dismantle the BRT corridor in July last year. The dismantling work being carried out by the PWD began at 2 p.m, in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and PWD Minister Satyendar Jain near DDA flats, Madangir.The 5.8-km long BRT stretch from Moolchand to Ambedkar Nagar was built at a cost of about Rs. 150 crore in 2008 by the then Congress government.The dismantling is expected to be completed by February. In the second phase, the government plans to engage residents of the nearby areas to prepare a comprehensive plan on redesigning the stretch. For this purpose, the government is looking forward to consultations with local Residents Welfare Associations. The government has already held preliminary meetings with members of local RWAs to thrash out a plan to redesign the roads.
