As many as 1,500 cases have been booked against organisers of cockfights for violating the High Court and the Supreme Court orders and conducting the game during Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh.Police sources said about 100 cases have been registered against the accused under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1986. The accused would be produced in court on Monday. The police are planning to book cases against organisers of ‘jallikattu’ at Rangampeta area in Chittoor district.A day before Sankranti, police served notices on the residents of Rangampeta not to conduct ‘jallikattu’, which was banned by the Supreme Court. However, the villagers reportedly organised the game.Villagers argue that they celebrated ‘Pasuvula Panduga’ (cattle festival), which is part of the tradition.‘Pasuvula Panduga’ is entirely different from ‘jallikattu’ which involves animals in the celebrations, but the animals are not hurt in any way. Jallikattu was reportedly organised in a big way under Ramachandrapuram and Chandragiri police station limits in Chittoor district, in which thousands of villagers participated.The police filed cases against the cockfight organisers in Krishna, East and West Godavari and Guntur districts.Nearly, 3,000 persons (habitual offenders who organised cockfights earlier) were rounded up to prevent the game.Police seized the fowls and knives used for the game.
