In a bid to popularise the consumption of millets, Sahaja Samruddha, which promotes conservation of indigenous crops and their diversity, has released a millet calendar for 2016. The calendar depicts variety of millets, some of which are on the verge of going locally extinct, due to poor demand despite their proven health benefits. Each page of the calendar highlights lesser-known variety of millets and has recipes that can be prepared using them.“There is a growing realisation of the health benefits of ragi with an increase in diabetes in the population. People are aware of only ragi mudde (ragi balls) … not all find it edible. Hence, we have brought out this calendar complete with health benefits of various varieties of millets and food that can be prepared using them,” G. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha said.The calendar has left out recipes related to bajra, ragi and jowar as they are known to the public and the focus is on foxtail millet, browntop millet, kodo millet and other varieties cultivated in Karnataka. The calendar costs Rs.100. For details one can contact Sahaja Samruddha on 9880862058 or 09535149520 or send an email to sahajaindia@gmail.com.
