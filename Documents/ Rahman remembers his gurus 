Music composer A.R. Rahman recalled his early inspirations in life when he received the Global Living Legend Award from the Adding Smiles Foundation, recently. “When I was young, Chennai was the hub of the South Indian film industry, and one of my earliest inspirations was my father (composer R.K. Shekhar), who used to help out many musicians,” reminisced the Oscar winner.The composer added that he had had a lot of teachers in his life. “I remember Mrs YGP; the slap she gave me for lack of attendance in school still rings in my ear,” he laughed. “I also remember the teacher who hit me hard on my knuckles. And then, later, I have to acknowledge my spiritual teachers; the lessons they taught me were like a drug… a good drug.”The composer, who was honoured along with several other inspirational people who have improved the lives of many, said, “I’m the least deserving of all this. With God’s grace, I try to do my bit. As you get older, you get fearless. You want to do something before you go.”
