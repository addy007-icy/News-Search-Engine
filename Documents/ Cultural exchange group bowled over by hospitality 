A 10-member team from Luxembourg, comprising students and teachers, were fascinated by the diverse culture, the style of living and the hospitality during their 10-day visit to several villages around Hampi.The team – Gilles, Lynn, Diana, Sophie, Alice, Anna (all students) and Deanne, Patricia, Sandy (teachers) of Lycee Aline Mayrisch school — are here as part of a youth cultural exchange programme.Sakhi trust, in association with READS, both non-governmental organisations, was their host.The visitors were of the common view that unlike their country where people were more conservative, the people here were very affectionate and very open and made them ‘feel at home’.The team visited several schools, interacted with the children to know about the education system, stayed with the ‘devadasis’ to know about their life style, saw the solid waste management in Anegundi, craft arts using banana fibre at Kishkinda Trust. Apart from that they visited the Primary health centre, Women Study Centre at Kannada Univeristy, girls hostels runs by Social Welfare department to enable them to pursue higher education among other things.“We have learnt a lot and there is much more for us to learn, especially the culture and tradition, joint family system among other things while our culture is different,” Sophie said.“After visiting Hampi monuments on Sunday, we will return with sweet memories,” they said.A 10-member team from Luxembourg visits villages inand around Hampi
