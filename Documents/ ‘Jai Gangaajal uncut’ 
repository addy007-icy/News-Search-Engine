Filmmaker Prakash Jha has denied reports that he made some changes in his upcoming cop drama Jai Gangaajal to secure a U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification.It was reported that the censor board wanted to grant the Priyanka Chopra-starrer an ‘Adult’ certificate with minimal cuts but Jha was not in agreement.Jha was apparently told by the CBFC to clean out his soundtrack and visuals of verbal and physical violence to make Jai Gangaajal eligible for a U/A certification.Slamming the report, Jha tweeted, “Misleading and inaccurate! Never made voluntary cuts.. We are going in appeal against the CBFC’s decision...”The action-drama, also starring Manav Kaul and Rahul Bhat, will hit theatres on March 4. — PTI
