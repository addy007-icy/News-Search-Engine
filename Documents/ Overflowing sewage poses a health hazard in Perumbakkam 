Not a day passes out without accidents taking place on Perumbakkam Main Road, which connects Medavakkam and Sholinganallur.The accidents, residents said, were due to bad road conditions and sewer overflow from storm water drains.Sewage overflow from manholes and incomplete storm water drains is not just a health hazard, but causes traffic problems to motorists everyday.Residents of Amudham Nagar pointed out that storm water drains were constructed by Highways department on both sides from Medavakkam to Bharathi Vidayalaya school in Perumbakkam.However, none of the village panchayats take responsibility to address the sewage overflow on roads, they alleged. Complaints to Perumbakkam village panchayat were ignored and staff informed them that the sewage overflow was from the neighbouring Medavakkam village panchayat, residents alleged.Highways officials said they have a proposal to complete the storm water drain network along with road-relaying work. But it was local bodiesâ€™ responsibility to keep them clean.Residents said during the monsoon, the road was cut off for traffic for more than one week. But this problem persists forever, due to indifferent attitude by government agencies.The improper planning and execution of basic infrastructure works was harming them, residents said and added the government agencies responsible should own up and put an end to the menace.Residents allege no measures have been taken to to address sewage overflow
