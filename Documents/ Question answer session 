Performance of elaborate yagas will tire out the performer. So provision was made for a discussion, where Brahma asks questions and the officiating priest answers. Brahma here does not mean the creator. It means a ritvik – a learned scholar. Each of the answers has an inner meaning as well, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse.Brahma asks what the foremost need of everyone is and hota answers that it is the sky, which gives us rains. Those who hear this answer will never experience a drought. Who is very old, asks Brahma, and the answer is that it is Lord Narayana, the One who is all pervasive. Those who hear this answer will attain proximity to Him.What makes people glow? Money makes people glow is the answer. The result that comes from hearing this answer is that the listener will enjoy good and healthy food, for after all it is healthy food that makes us glow. Who goes alone? The Sun goes alone. Although he has his chariot, it is his brilliance that is unique and eye catching.But when the processional deity of Lord Narayana comes out of a temple, even the Sun’s brilliance seems dim, like a lamp lit during the day.Who is born again? The Moon is born again, because it waxes and wanes, and each time it grows it appears fresh. He who hears this answer will be blessed with long life. What is the medicine for cold weather? Agni is the medicine for cold weather.The inner meaning is that our ignorance is a fog, and the Acharya who leads us out of this fog is the Agni we need. He who hears this answer will seek out a good Acharya and learn Ashtakshara mantra from him and be liberated.
