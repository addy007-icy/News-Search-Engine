Though the Delhi government tried to make nursery admissions easier for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) this year, technical glitches kept the process from being hassle-free.Many people complained about the software crashing often, while volunteers helping the parents filling up the forms said the software had not mapped the city properly. For example, Dwarka in south-west Delhi is shown to be just a kilometer from Patparganj, which is in East Delhi.An official at the DoE said: “We are aware that there are issues with the online EWS system and we are working towards fixing them.”A letter in this regard has been written to the Directorate of Education (DoE), requesting the Director’s intervention in getting these issues corrected.The letter written by lawyer and activist Khagesh Jha reads: “We have received several complaints from parents that the software does show any school in their area despite schools being available in the area. The complaints are mostly from localities like Sharma colony, Amarjyoti Colony, jhuggi clusters of Sector 25 of Rohini, Yamuna Vihar, Palam Colony, Shahbad Dairy, slums of Seelampur, Suraj Park and others.”According to the letter, a large number of slums are either missing from the software or are attached with localities they are not part of.
