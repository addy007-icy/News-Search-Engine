Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will visit Bandlapalli village of the Singanamala constituency in Anantapur district on February 2, marking the completion of a decade of the launch of NREGS in the village, District Congress Committee president B.Y. Ramaiah said on Wednesday.The scheme was launched in 2006 to provide food security and check migration of small and marginal farmers and agricultural labourers, but the TDP Government had failed in its implementation and turned it into a money-spinner for the ruling party functionaries, he alleged in a media conference here.Referring to Chandranna Kanuka, he alleged that sub-standard commodities were being distributed to the people on eve of festivals by spending Rs. 300 crore. The campaign for constructing toilets was not evoking response as bills were not paid for those built in the past, Mr. Ramaiah said. The Central and State Governments lost the peopleâ€™s confidence, he said.
