The BEL ground in Doddabommasandra, where Niranjan E.K. would run every evening to play cricket with his friends, on Monday became the venue for his friends and community to pay their last respects to the martyr.Uday Kumar and Sanal K., his pre-university classmates at BEL College and who played cricket with him, remembered their ‘jovial friend who was fond of batting’. “Even then, he would be transformed as soon as he wore his NCC uniform. He was very proud and fond of it,” Mr. Uday recalled.The queue to pay homage testified to the city’s love and respect for its soldier. Comprising his friends, course mates, neighbours and total strangers, it took more than five hours for the queue to wind up.Niranjan's father K. Shivarajan is a retired BEL employee and Niranjan, an alumni of BEL College. The entire BEL family – present and retired employees, and students of BEL school and college – had turned up to pay their respects to one of their own.

Nijjar, General Officer Commanding (GOC), Karnataka and Kerala Sub Area, who paid his last respects to Lt. Col.
