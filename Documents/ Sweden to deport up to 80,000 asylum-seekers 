Interior Minister Anders Ygeman says Sweden could deport between 60,000 and 80,000 asylum—seekers in coming years.Mr. Ygeman told newspaper Dagens Industri that since about 45 per cent of asylum applications are currently rejected, the country must get ready to send back tens of thousands of the 163,000 who sought shelter in Sweden last year.“I think that it could be about 60,000 people, but it could also be up to 80,000,” Mr. Ygeman was quoted as saying.Germany and Sweden were the top destinations for asylum—seekers in Europe last year
