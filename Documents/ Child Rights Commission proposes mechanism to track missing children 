The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights(NCPCR) will hold a meet with State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights(SCPCRs) in New Delhi on Thursday which will predominantly work towards constitution of a mechanism for monitoring the missing/trafficked children.That apart, the day-long meeting to be attended by chairpersons of SCPCRs will focus on co-ordination for various child protection related issues.Apart from better coordination with all SCPCRS, so as to strengthen the monitoring mechanism for protection of child rights in the country, the agenda of the meeting will include concrete plans to develop a mechanism of maintaining information in consultation with SCPCRs to avoid duplication of efforts and facilitate early redressal of grievances, says chairperson of NCPCR Stuti Kacker in her letter of invite to State Commissions.On the issue of trafficking and missing children which is growing in concern, as per National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) data, 46.2 per cent of total crime against children falls under kidnapping and abduction out of the total 33,098 crime against children in 2011. In all, there are officially over 55,000 missing children in the country (2011-12). The organised gangs have been operating abduction/kidnapping in various regions for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour and organ racket.Keeping this in view, NCPCR is gearing to develop a mechanism with State Commissions to regularly monitor the information on missing/trafficked children, which will be discussed in detail in the meeting.Other issues on the agenda of the proposed day-long meeting would include monitoring the implementation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, monitoring the implementation of JuvenileJustice Act, safeguarding the rights of children in contact with Railways, monitoring the implementation of ‘Street to School’ campaign, identification of areas of child rights for monitoring and interventions by NCPCR/SCPCRs.In the previous year, the NCPCR had launched an online complaints management system e-Baalnidan on March, 2014 to effectively address the complaints received. This system, the Commission claims, as expected has successfully brought efficiency and transparency in redressal of the complaints related to child rights, received by it.Under Section 24 of the CPCR Act, 2005, State Commissions are also mandated to inquire into complaints related violations of child rights. Further, under Section 32 (4), redressal of grievances under Right to Education Act, the appeal preferred under Section 32(3) shall be decided by the SCPCR. The NCPCR proposes to develop a mechanism of maintaining information in consultation with SCPCRs to avoid duplication of efforts and facilitate early redressal of grievances.
