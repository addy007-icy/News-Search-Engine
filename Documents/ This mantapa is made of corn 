The beautifully decorated structures created out of coconuts, arecanuts and maize cobs at the Horekanike Store Hall constructed on the eastern side of the Rajangana Parking Space have become a centre of attraction here.Usually, foodgrains, pulses, and coconuts donated by the devotees for the incoming Paryaya Mutt are stored at Badagu Malige at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple complex. However, as Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt will ascend the Paryaya Peetha at the 800-year-old Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple for a record fifth time on January 18, the organisers are expecting a lot of donations.Hence, a Horekanike Store Hall has been erected on 34,000 square feet of land near Rajagana Parking Space. The Horekanike donations, which started on January 5, will conclude on January 16.The store hall has 14 separate stalls for maintaining items such as coconuts, de-husked coconuts, tender coconuts, bananas, plantain leaves, pumpkin, yellow pumpkin, rice ‘murras’, rice, eggplant, elephant yam, coconut oil and pulses.The maintenance of the store hall has been entrusted to the Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP). In order to make the store hall attractive, the members of the SKDRDP have created structures of agricultural and horticultural products.As one enters the hall, one is greeted with a ‘mantapa’ made out of maize corns. There is a chariot made out of arecanuts. Behind it is a hexagonal shed made out of tender coconuts, and a paddy ‘kanaja’ next to it. All these structures are about 10 feet tall. There is also a four-foot-tall statue of Lord Krishna.Mahaveer Ajri, regional director, Udupi region, SKDRDP, said that these structures were made out of agricultural and horticultural products so that people could not not only see the items donated but also know that it was possible to use them artistically.The hall leads to the Adhokshaja Mantapa, where cultural programmes are held at 7 p.m.“People coming to the cultural programmes come here to appreciate the beauty of these structures,” Mr. Ajri said.
