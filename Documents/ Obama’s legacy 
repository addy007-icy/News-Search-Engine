In the recent past, U.S. President Barack Obama has attempted more than the earlier Presidents to reach out to every American family to secure their welfare (“ >Mixed legacy of the Obama years,” editorial, Jan.14) . He did this despite the budget being burdened by military spending and loss of lives in conflicts. His measures are also remarkable considering that he struggled to gain support from Congress.G.T. Sampathkumarachar,MysuruWhile former American Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had their second terms steeped in scandals and quagmires of war, President Barack Obama has succeeded to a large extent in evading that ignominy and defending his legacy. From ushering significant reforms like the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to securing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Pacific Rim countries, Mr. Obama has exuded impeccable statesmanship.The thaw between the U.S. and Cuba, the Iran nuclear deal and consensus to mitigate climate change and leverage strategic and economic interests bear testimony to the fact that Mr. Obama has not shied from rising above partisanship to promote progressive causes.Shreyans Jain,Shalimar Bagh, DelhiPresident Barrack Obama’s final State of Union address didn’t match his first address, one given after he became the 44th U.S. President. But the talented speaker rose to the occasion to side with the minorities and other affected sections of the American society. Health care reforms, putting the country’s economy on a sound track and mending ties with Iran and Cuba are his major achievements. It is hoped that before he steps down, he accomplishes unfinished tasks like shutting down Guantanamo Bay prison and working with the Congress to achieve a meaningful criminal justice reform for Americans.Gregory Fernandes,Mumbai
