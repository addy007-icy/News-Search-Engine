Office-bearers of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha (KPRS) have said that they will intensify their struggle demanding sufficient water for the tail-end parts of the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal (TLBC) if the talks scheduled with the officials of the Department of Water Resources do not yield desirable results.Addressing a press conference here on Monday, KPRS leader D. Veerana Gowda said that two meetings with officials were scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday at Sindhanur and Munirabad, respectively.“Because of the unscientific planning of the irrigation canal network along the TLBC and excess use of water at upper reaches of the canal to irrigate unauthorised land in Koppal district, the authorised fields at the lower reaches of the canal in Sindhanur, Manvi and Raichur taluks in Raichur district are facing severe water shortage. We have staged agitations several times, but our cries have fallen on deaf ears,” he said. Mr. Gowda expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s “discriminative approach” in handling issues related to irrigation.
