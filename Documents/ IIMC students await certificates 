Students of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC), despite passing out from the institute, are still awaiting their post-graduate diploma certificates. The disgruntled students have now created an online petition urging Union Minister Arun Jaitley to intervene.According to Ajmal Aramam, general secretary, IIMC Students and Journalists Association that has created the petition — “Arun Jaitley, appoint DG, organise IIMC convocation and distribute certificates immediately” at Change.org — the delay is because the new Director General of the institute has not been appointed.“The convocation ceremony is held every year in October end or November. But, so has not been the case this time as a result of which the batch of 2014-15 has not yet received their certificates. The administration told us that the certificate bears the signature of the DG and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is yet to appoint one for the position,” said Mr Aramam. IIMC is an autonomous body funded by the Ministry of I&B. The term of the previous IIMC DG Sunit Tandon had ended in November last year. According to sources, KG Suresh who has been a guest faculty and is the editor of a Delhi-based online think tank, Vivekananda International Foundation, is all set to become the next IIMC DG.
