The Kerala High court on Thursday ordered a CBI probe into the case relating to the murder of Manoj, a BJP local leader in 2012 at Payyoli in Kozhikode.Justice B. Kemal Pasha while allowing a writ petition filed by Sajid, a friend of Manoj, observed that there was something fishy in the case and the same had to be unearthed.Manoj, an autorickshaw driver was attacked by a gang, allegedly consisting of some Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] activists, at Payyoli in February 2012 in the presence of his wife and children. He later died at the Government Medical College Hospital. He was taking rest at his home when the attack took place.The court observed that it was true that the CBI had some limitations in carrying out the investigation in a fruitful manner in the context of strong opposition from a major political party. The CBI could not shirk its responsibility by pointing out that there might be resistance or frequent obstruction from the political party in conducting a further investigation.It was true that the State machinery had failed to come forward with a proper investigation. Justice could not be unearthed through the hands of those persons who were behind such intimidatory tactics, the court said.The court noted that it was all the more painful that even the wife of the deceased Manoj had opposed a further investigation by the CBI into the case for reasons best known to her. She did not turn up before the court despite granting her opportunity to put forward her cause against such a further investigation.The court observed that if a further investigation was not ordered in the matter, implementation of justice would be hampered, which could not be permitted.Contradictory probesDirector General of Prosecution T. Asaf Ali submitted that the State government had no objection to hand over the case to the CBI.He pointed out that the investigations conducted by the local police and later by the crime branch were contradictory.He submitted that the wife of the deceased Manoj who moved a petition against a CBI probe had earlier made an application along with mother to the Home Minister requesting for further probe into the conspiracy part of the case. So, the wife of the deceased could not now take a U-turn at this stage, shutting out the evidence in the case which would only help the accused.The court also directed the State government to provide necessary police force to the CBI to see that a proper investigation was carried out.
