District Congress Committee (DCC) leaders demanded that the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, talk about his promises made to the people of Warangal during his ensuing visit.Former Chief Whip G.V. Ramana Reddy, DCCB chairman J. Raghava Reddy and others said that the Chief Minister made tall promises of getting underground drainage within six months after the elections. But even after 18 months of being in power, it was not delivered.The Wagon factory, textile park, outer ring road and many other promises just remain on paper.“The Chief Minister camped here for five days during last January and said he will give two bedroom houses to all slum-dwellers. But nothing materialised. We are asking this as a responsible Opposition party on behalf of the people and there is no politics involved in this. We expect an answer from the Chief Minister himself,” Mr. Ramana Reddy said.The Congress leader accused the ruling TRS government of discriminating against Warangal district. The third phase of 800 MW power plant proposed at Chelpur has been kept in cold storage, the Devadula third phase works stalled, Kanthanapally project was dropped and another proposed in Karimnagar.“The Chief Minister should tell why Kanthanapally was given up. It should have generated power and provided irrigation water to farmers in Warangal, Khammam and Nalgonda districts,” Mr. Ramana Reddy pointed out.The State government should consider sanctioning metro rail to Warangal and announce the master plan for Warangal city soon.Mr. Ramana Reddy alleged that the State government was trying to postpone the Greater Warangal Municipal elections to gain political mileage. The elections in Hyderabad, Khammam and Warangal should be held simultaneously, he demanded.DCC leaders accuse the TRS government of discriminating against Warangal district
