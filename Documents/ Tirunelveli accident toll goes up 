The number of people from the State who succumbed to injuries sustained in the January 8 bus accident near Tirunelveli went up to seven on Thursday with four-year-old Ann Evelyn dying in a private hospital at Pattom here.Ann’s father Raju Avarachan and mother Jeni Raju are still under treatment. Mr. Avarachan has his left hand amputated and is yet to gain consciousness. His wife has lost her right ear, has fractures on her spinal cord and multiple fractures on her left hand. Ann, an LKG student in a private school at Pettah, had both her legs and one hand amputated.The condition of the little girl, a regular presence in dance and cultural programmes of the school, had shocked all those who knew her, with the news that she had lost almost all her limbs being equally depressing. Infections that found way into her blood are believed to have led to her death around 3 p.m. on Thursday.The total number of deaths in the accident has reached 12, seven of them from the State, including four toddlers aged below five.These include Aaron Biju, who also had a leg amputated and died earlier this week; and Aaron’s younger brother Alroy; and Suji Leo, five, both of whom had died soon after the accident.
