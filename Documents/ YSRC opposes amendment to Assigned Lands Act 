The YSR Congress has alleged that the State government has initiated steps to alienate weaker sections from the assigned lands to benefit the ‘creamy layer’ of the ruling Telugu Desam Party.The party lamented that efforts were under way to hand over 2,080 acres of assignment lands in and around the capital region to capitalists. Steps were being taken accordingly to regularise the ownership of the lands, YSRC spokesman Tammineni Sitaram said.Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who promised to give lands to weaker sections in the run up to the previous elections was, however, trying to amend the Act paving the way for real estate business. Mr. Naidu was trying to take away lands from the marginalised sections including Dalits and tribes to benefit his favoured few.The State government had turned governance into a corporate business to benefit Mr. Naidu and his close associates, he said adding if the proposed amendment was allowed over 7,000 acres of assignment lands would fall into the hands of corporates.
