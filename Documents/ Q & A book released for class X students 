Thiagarajan and Education Secretary G.Ragesh Chandra were also present on the occasion.Free of costOnce the books are printed and ready, they will be distributed free of cost during the Class X guidance program, ‘Sigarathai Noki’ that the Education Department conducts every year.It is expected that the programme will be held in the last week, said N. Ramalingam, Chief Educational Officer.The officials also said studying from the question bank alone will guarantee a minimum pass mark for all the students.Although it is important to guarantee passing, the Department decided to release the question bank a little later to allow the students to study their subjects independent of the booklet.The booklet is meant to be only a supplementary study aid.Committees formedThe Department formed committees of five teachers for each subject, who analysed the previous year’s question papers and prepared the booklet using common questions and best possible answers to these questions.
