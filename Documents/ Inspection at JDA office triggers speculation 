Amid reports of alleged embezzlement of huge funds meant for the farm mechanisation scheme during the financial year 2014-15, a team of senior Agriculture Department officials from Hyderabad on Thursday inspected records at the office of the Joint Director of Agriculture (JDA) here.The three-member team headed by an officer of the rank of Additional Director verified the old records and inspected some important office files during the day-long inspection at the JDA office here, sources said.The sudden inspection of office files and other documents assumes significance as it comes close on the heels of reported suspension of seven Agriculture Department officials of the JDA office in Medak district by the government on charges of misappropriation of funds three days ago. The alleged embezzlement of funds in Khammam district came to the fore after the representatives of some companies, which supplied farm equipment to the farmers under the farm mechanisation scheme during 2014-15, reportedly approached the higher ups of the Agriculture Department over delay in clearing their bills.A section of them reportedly expressed suspicion that a retired employee, who oversaw the implementation of the scheme during that particular year, was behind the “embezzlement” of the funds.It is suspected that those involved in the alleged scam “misappropriated” funds to the tune of Rs.2 crore by drawing public money through self-cheques in unauthorised manner and resorting to other “fraudulent” means. A three-member official team from Hyderabad has inspected the records in our office, said an official of the JDA office, who did not wish to be identified.
