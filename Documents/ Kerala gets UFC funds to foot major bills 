Even after the Union Finance Commission (UFC) providing funds to contain the revenue deficit and also honouring obligatory commitments, the State government is allegedly delaying the implementation of the Tenth Pay Commission recommendations.Official sources told The Hindu here that the finance commission has awarded Rs.9,519 crore for containing the revenue deficit of the State and also for meeting major commitments, mainly the revision of salary and pensions of government employees and service pensioners. Still, the government has not so far spelt out any specific timeframe for revising the salary of the 5,11,457 employees and the pension of 4,11,846 service pensioners, sources said.Revenue deficitKerala is one of the 11 States which has got the largesse of the commission for reining in the revenue deficit. There was also a notable increase in the tax share, from 32.5 per cent to 42 per cent and also the special grants for various schemes, including the Centrally sponsored schemes, and it totally amounted to 49.5 per cent.Budget estimateOfficial sources told The Hindu here that against the Rs.7,831 crore deficit stated in the budget estimate, the State government had projected a deficit of Rs.19,151 crore to the Centre for the current year. One of the main commitments that the State government had mentioned was the salary revision of employers and teachers.In this context, the commission has awarded Rs.4,640 crore for meeting the revenue deficit in the current year, Rs.3,350 crore for 2016-17 and Rs.1,529 crore for 2017-18. Since the State had passed the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, it was mandatory for the government to bring down the deficit to zero.No time-frameBut for an announcement to implement the recommendations, no specific timeframe has so far been set for the purpose. On issuing the order by February end, the official procedures in this score may get protracted to mid-June.Since the State government already has the funds provided by the commission, it can well complete the process in the current year itself without any hassles, sources said.
