Less than a year since Delhi got a new toll tax contractor, the municipal corporations are once again in the process of getting a new concessionaire on board.The current contractor, SMYR Consortium, will be allowed to exit its contract on January 31 as it had started incurring losses after the Supreme Court ordered an additional green tax on vehicles entering Delhi.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for toll tax collection, will be floating a tender this week to invite bidders for a 40-week contract. The reserve price has been set at Rs.333 crore, and the winning bidder will have to collect both toll tax and the environment compensation charge from the 124 toll points in Delhi.The previous contract was signed in May 2015, after a yearâ€™s delay. The three-year contract was supposed to net the civic bodies Rs.541 crore annually, but the concessionaire started paying less after the ECC was imposed in November 2015. According to the contractor, there had been a 40 per cent dip in commercial vehicles entering Delhi since the ECC was started, leading to losses. However, the SDMC said the actual fall was about 20 per cent.
