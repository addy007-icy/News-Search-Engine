With regard to the Delhi High Court’s move to issue notice to the government in connection with scrapping of management quota, the association of private schools said that the quota should not be scrapped as schools need to “oblige” people.The Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools had filed writ petition in the High Court challenging the government’s decision asking the schools to scrap management quota saying it was “arbitrary and whimsical” and would impact the autonomy of private schools to regulate their admissions. “The government cannot take away our right to include management quota in the admission process. The schools need the quota as there are many people that the schools have to oblige,” said Delhi State Public School’s Management Association, RC Jain.“Many important people including government officers and bureaucrats come asking for a seat for their children and we have to oblige them.“If we do not have a management quota, how are we going to do it? Anyway, the quota is just 20 per cent apart from the 25 per cent EWS, rest of the seats are available for general category,” he added.Trying to justify the management quota by saying that the government does not help private schools in getting established and hence they do not have the right to take away autonomy from them, Mr. Jain added: “There are just 400 schools that have received land from the government agencies, rest of the 2,000 schools are operating from their own land.”Activists working in the field of education, however, have an entirely different opinion on the issue. “Management quota is the mother of all evils. It should definitely be scrapped. We are with the Kejriwal government in trying to scrap the quota,” said lawyer, activist Khagesh Jha.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has earlier called the management quota the biggest “education scam”.
