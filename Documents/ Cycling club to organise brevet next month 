While 16 members of Mangalore Cycling Club (MACC) pedalled from Mangaluru to Manipal for the ‘Save Fuel and Save Environment’ drive of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., on Tuesday, they had a bigger dream—successfully organising and participating in the MACC Karavali 200-km brevet on February 28.Brevets [meaning a certificate] de Randonneurs Mondiaus (BRMs) is a challenging ride of 200 km or more, with a specific time limit.Every rider who completes the ride within the specified time following the guidelines will be the winner in the event. The Randonneur carries a brevet card that has to be signed and stamped at each check point along the way.MACC was recognised by Audax India Randonneurs, which in turn is recognised by the Audax Club Parisien for conducting and overseeing BRMs and Audax events.The club is thus bringing in the first brevet to coastal Karnataka, said MACC member Anil Shet. Mr. Shet said the 200-km ride along the west coast passing through flat beach roads for about 60 km, will present some pleasant and amazing stretches.Earlier, cycling enthusiasts from the coast had to go to Mysuru or Bengaluru to participate in BRM.Recently about seven cyclists from Mangaluru had successfully completed the Mysuru-Bavali brevet. Mr. Shet said that after a series of high quality cycling events organised throughout the year, the MACC was included in the panel of organisations in India to hold the brevet.The club is now one of the 18 cycling clubs in India authorised to hold BRMs.He said the Karavali Brevet route, from Mangaluru to Koteshwara in Udupi district (100 km) will be challenging for cyclists.Those who complete 200 km (Mangaluru-Koteshwara and back) in 13.5 hours would get a citation directly from Audax.Tuesday’s Manipal ride was to mark Republic Day celebrations. The IOC had organised Bengaluru ride last year on the same occasion. MACC members, reached back by Tuesday evening, after successfully riding to Manipal.
