A woman journalist, Revati Laul, was allegedly assualted by Suresh Chhara, a convict in the Naroda Patoya massacre case of 2002 riots during an interview at his residence on late evening Wednesday.Based on her complaint, the police arrested Chhara, who was released on parole by a local court to trace his missing daughter.Chhara was awarded 31-year imprisonment by a trial court in Naroda Patiya massacre case involving brutal killings of 98 members of the minority community during the communal riots in 2002."I visited him at his house and I politely asked him if he wanted to share details about himself, his past, family," she said, adding, "in the midst of interview, he started punching and slapping and banged my head without any provocation."A former NDTV and Tehelka journalist, Ms Laul has been living in Ahmedabad to work on a book on the convicts of the Naroda Patiya case.Earlier, Chhara's wife had claimed that he had tried to rape her when he was released on parole earlier. Subsequently, his parole was cancelled. But last week, he was granted parole again after he requested the court to release him to find his daughter who was missing for several months.
