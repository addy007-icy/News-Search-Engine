The report headlined “National Family Health Survey: PMO exerts pressure, data is out” (Jan. 21), is based on wrong premises.The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare recognises the importance of making any data collected with public funds and of public interest available in the public domain as soon as possible, as otherwise the usefulness of the data would diminish over time. The NFHS data were duly examined in the Ministry and due process was followed before releasing them. A press release was issued. The data have been made available to all interested parties at the earliest.Dr. Manisha Verma,Director, Media,Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
