Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) president Vijayakant, on Monday, trained his guns on PMK chief ministerial-candidate Anbumani Ramadoss by claiming that the college in Villupuram, three students of which were found dead on Saturday, was given clearances without proper infrastructure when the latter was Union Health Minister.In a statement, Mr. Vijayakant, without actually naming Dr. Anbumani, said the SVS Naturopathy and Yoga Medical College got permission when a person from Tamil Nadu was the Union Health Minister. Mr. Vijayakant further alleged that “the information coming out was that without proper infrastructure and trained teachers, the permission to the college was given illegally and the college functioned without the proper clearance of the Tamil Nadu government.”Anbumani’s rebuttalCountering this, Dr. Anbumani said the accusation from the DMDK president stemmed from an utter lack of understanding of how the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare functioned.“I did not handle the Indian System of Medicine. The entire department of AYUSH came under my colleague and Minister of State Panabaka Lakshmi. I don't even know when this college was given permission,” he said.Mr. Vijayakant also demanded a CBI probe into the deaths, stating that the parents have alleged murder. The Leader of the Opposition also slammed the State government for not acting quickly in the matter despite protests by the students.
