The State government employees and teachers will go on a token strike on January 12 raising a slew of demands, including implementation of pay revision.Their other demands included abandoning the move to cut various posts and checking price rise, P.H.M. Ismail, general convener, Action Council of State Employees and Teachers; and S. Vijayakumaran Nair, general convener, Adhyapaka Service Sanghatana Samara Samithi; said at a press conference here on Monday. They said more service organisations would take part in the strike.They said the unions were forced to call the strike as the government had failed to implement the pay revision. The last pay revision was on July 1, 2009.Even after five years, the pay revision had not been implemented. The government had set up the pay commission in November 2013, but its tenure of six months had been extended four times. The government approach was to extend the pay commission tenure indefinitely.They said the unions had staged a number of protests to get the pay revision implemented. While accepting the pay commission report on July 13 last, the government had promised to implement the pay revision. But no steps were taken to keep the promise.
