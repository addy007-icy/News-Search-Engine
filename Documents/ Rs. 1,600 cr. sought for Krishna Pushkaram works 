The Krishna district administration has submitted a proposal to the government seeking release of funds to the tune of Rs. 1,600 crore to initiate works for the forthcoming Krishna Pushkaram.Addressing a review meeting on Thursday on arrangements to be made for Krishna Pushkaram, which is scheduled for August this year, with officials of various departments, District Collector Babu A. asked them to draw action plans and follow them scrupulously to ensure completion of works much before the commencement of the river festival.Underscoring the need to maintain quality, he said officials must be in a position to estimate the time frame of each project, as it would help in seeking financial help from the government accordingly.Seeking department-wise segregation of works proposed to be taken up, he said the count must be accurate, and that allied departments like Roads and Buildings, Panchayat Raj, Irrigation and Electricity must coordinate.The Collector wanted all department heads to coordinate with their counterparts in East and West Godavari districts for shifting of equipment used during the Godavari Pushkaram to Vijayawada.Responding to this, Road and Buildings Department Superintending Engineer K. Seshu Kumar said the barricading equipment used in Godavari Pushkaram could be made use of for Krishna Pushkaram as well.Directing the DRO to set up a (Pushkar) control room at the Collectorate on February 1, he said for proper coordination, every department should set up independent control rooms.Maintaining that he would review Pushkaram works every week, the Collector said every department must appoint a liaison officer to keep track of the movement of files pertaining to Pushkaram works in Hyderabad.
