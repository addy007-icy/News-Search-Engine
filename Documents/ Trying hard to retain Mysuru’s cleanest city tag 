Ahead of Swachh Sarvekshan, a survey on the cleanliness of select cities with Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) completing one year, Mysuru, the country’s cleanest city, is aiming at retaining the tag.As part of ongoing efforts to educate citizens on their roles and responsibilities, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has taken up various initiatives, including installation of signage in the city for making an impact on the residents on cleanliness and hygiene.The signage in Kannada and English is being put up in major commercial hubs like D. Devaraja Urs Road with the aim of encouraging visitors to keep the surroundings clean.“We wish to draw the attention of the people on their responsibilities. Swachh Mysuru is not just our task. It should be implemented as a team. We hope the signs will help educate pedestrians, shoppers, and tourists,” said MCC Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath. He told The Hindu that the MCC is installing signages on major roads and commercial hubs in the first phase. “One signage says there is no limit to cleanliness and another says keep your surrounding as clean as possible. Such messages will help spread the philosophy,” he said. Swachh Sarvekshan will act as an important tool for citizens to share their feedback on cleanliness drives. Anyone can take part by giving a missed call on 1800-267-2777. The toll-free number will be active till January 15.Mr. Betsurmath said a lot of work had been done in the area of cleanliness after the city bagged the cleanest city tag under the Swachh Bharat Mission.The top-ranked Swachh city is also roping in school and college students in an attempt to retain the tag. The MCC had set a target of reaching the Swachh agenda among two lakh school and college students.
