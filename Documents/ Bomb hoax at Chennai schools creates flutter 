On Tuesday morning, parents of school-going children in the city experienced a frisson of fear as a bomb scare loomed large. The scare was traced to a hoax call that claimed a bomb had been placed in a city school.Soon, rumours flew thick and fast, leading to a perception that many schools were being targeted, with the result that worried parents began to pick up their wards from schools.According to the police, the first call was received at the city police control room claiming that a bomb had been planted at a school in Kelambakkam. “This call was transferred to the Kancheepuram district police,” said a police officer. At 11.30 a.m, a woman called up the city police control room to check if the call was true as she wanted to collect her child from school.“After this, it is not clear how it spread. But parents started rushing to schools to take their children home,” said a police officer.Some schools, especially those on ECR, closed for the day by 1 p.m. Meanwhile, the city police started circulating a message on WhatsApp to counter the rumours: “Rumour is being spread on WhatsApp stating that bombs were planted in some schools in Chennai. But it’s a hoax. There is no need to panic – Chennai Police.”The police were also instructed to go to schools and announce that it was all a rumour.
