Onion growers have been advised to take steps against diseases attacking the crop in view of the prevailing weather conditions on account of winter marked by morning fog.According to Deputy Director of Horticulture Ravindra Hakati here on Thursday, diseases caused by fungus or bacteria are common due to adverse weather, unhealthy soil conditions, nutritional imbalances, and unscientific use of chemicals. He said that farmers should adopt integrated pest management techniques.“Standing crops may get affected because of adverse weather conditions. Around 750 hectares to 800 ha are under onion cultivation in the district in the rabi season. Ramdurg, Savadatti and Bailhongal taluks are major onion-growing regions in the district,” Mr. Hakati said.Common diseasesCommon diseases which could attack red and white onions are purple blotch, leaf blight, sooty mold, neck rot and downy mildew. The bacteria spreading these diseases could by managed by spraying 2 milli litres of chlorpyrifos in one litre of water, 2 gm of ‘Kavach’ in one litre of water or one milli litre of ‘Score’ in one litre of water on the crop once in a fortnight, depending on the intensity of the disease.Total area under onion in the district around 750 ha to800 haRamdurg, Savadatti, Gokak and Bailhongal are majoronion producing taluks in the districtAverage yield of onion per hectare is 22 tonnes to25 tonnes
