Lack of coordination among various government departments and the TDB has been identified as a major hurdle in the execution of pilgrim amenity schemes as well as forest conservation measures in this environmentally sensitive forest patch.An expert study has put the plastic waste generation at Sabarimala and surrounding areas during the two-month annual pilgrim season at 60 lakh kg. Neither the TDB nor the government agencies have evolved anything resembling a cohesive, pragmatic plan to remove the huge quantity of plastic waste from the forests, ultimately leaving the hapless wild fauna and the forest ecology at the receiving end.However, the TDB has auctioned the right to collect plastic waste from Sabarimala at Rs.3.5 lakh, this year, according to B.L. Renu Gopal, Devaswom Executive Officer.Environmentalists say that the KWAâ€™s indiscriminate chlorination of the highly polluted raw river water for drinking water supply at Sabarimala and Pampa can impact the forest ecosystem as well.Welcoming the Kerala High Court order directing the Special Commissioner K. Babu to execute the ban on plastic, including PET bottles, from February 1, environmentalists in Central Travancore are clamouring for an integrated water treatment plant and a well-designed new pipeline network for Sabarimala, Pampa and Nilackal, instead of opting for the reverse osmosis plants.They argue that the TDB could even think of exploring the possibility of supplying medicated drinking water through a well-designed pipeline network at Sabarimala and Pampa in association with stakeholders like the Ayyappa Seva Sanghom and the Ayyappa Seva Samajam.Study pegs plastic waste generation at Sabarimala during pilgrim season at 60 lakh kg.
