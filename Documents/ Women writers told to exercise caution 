Meena Kandasamy, writer and activist, has exhorted young women writers to exercise caution especially when they translate the works of others.“Be acutely aware of what is going on in languages… as the society around is most unequal and most oppressive,” she said while inaugurating a conclave of South Indian women writers at Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, Tirur, on Wednesday.“New literature cannot be born unless new worlds are born. We have to move beyond ourselves,” she told the young writers assembled at the three-day national meet titled ‘Resonance and Resistance.’She said the double standards of the society towards women writers were being exposed every day. “If you are a woman writer, you are already slaughtered. People make up their mind even before reading the first word you have written,” she said, exhorting women to surpass all impediments created by the male-dominant society.Addressing the gathering, novelist P. Valsala advised women writers to look around wherever they go. “Wherever we go, we have plenty of resources around us for writing,” she said.
