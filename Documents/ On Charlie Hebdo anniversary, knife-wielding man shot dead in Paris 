Officers shot and killed a knife-wielding man wearing a fake explosives vest outside a police station in northern Paris on Thursday, French officials said, a year to the day since an >attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo launched a bloody year in the French capital.France has been under a state of emergency since a series of >attacks claimed by the Islamic State group killed 130 people in Paris on November 13, 2015, and tensions increased this week as the anniversary of the January attacks approached.Soldiers were posted in front of schools and security forces were even more present than usual amid a series of tributes to the dead.Officials said the man shot to death on Thursday wore a fake explosive vest and threatened officers at the entrance of a police station minutes after French president Francois Hollande, speaking in a different location, paid respects to officers fallen in the line of duty.Pierre-Henry Brandet, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the man at the police station is believed to have cried out “Allahu Akbar”, Arabic for “God is great”. He has not been identified, and Mr. Brandet told The Associated Press that police do not believe anyone else was involved.Alexis Mukenge, who saw the shooting from inside another building, told the network iTele that police told the man, “Stop… Move back.” Mr. Mukenge said officers fired twice and the man immediately dropped to the ground.The Goutte d’Or neighbourhood in Paris’ 18th arrondissement, a multi-ethnic district not far from the Gare du Nord train station, was locked down, as were two metro lines running through the area, though they later reopened.Police expanded their security cordon about an hour after the attack, swiftly and roughly clearing out hundreds who had gathered at a subway station and along nearby streets. Shops were ordered shuttered along neighbouring streets, and shop owners hastily rolled down shutters.Mr. Hollande had said earlier that what he called a “terrorist threat” would continue to weigh on France. The government has announced new measures extending police powers to allow officers to use their weapons to “neutralise someone who has just committed one or several murders and is likely to repeat these crimes”.
