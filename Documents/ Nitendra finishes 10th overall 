Pacesetters led the way at the 13th Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon 2016.Armyman Thonackal Gopi’s task was to set the pace till the 30-km mark for training mates Nitendra Singh Rawat and Kheta Ram from the Army Sports Institute, Pune. He completed the men’s marathon in second place, pulling Nitendra (first among Indians) and Kheta (third among Indians) under the Olympic qualification mark for the Rio Games 2016.The world athletics body, IAAF, announced 2:17:00 as qualification criteria for distance runners.Gopi emerged a surprise second (2:16:15), between India topper Nitendra (2:15:48) whose time was 10th overall among elite men, and Kheta (2:17:23) close behind in third place. Nitendra becomes the second Indian (after Ram Singh Yadav in 2008) to finish among the first 10 in the full marathon.Kenyan Gideon Kipketer won the men’s event in a course record time of 2:08:35. Kipketer’s pace in the first half hurt the others in a pack of 18 runners, Seboka Dibaba recovered energy to stagger in at second place among elite runners, clocking 2:09:20 to also better Kiprop’s winning time two years ago at this course. d. The full marathon (men and women) has a separate prize money category for Indians to show their mettle against Africans with reputation. Sudha Singh, a steeplechaser with podium finishes at the Asian level, showed more endurance than elite runners to earn an overall seventh place in women’s marathon (2:39:28), Lalita Babar, whose pet track event is the steeplechase, came in 10th overall and second among Indians (2:41:55). O.P. Jaisha was third (2:43:26).Sudha and Lalita’s timing is below the IAAF-stipulated Olympic qualification timing for women marathoners (2:42:00). Jaisha, with a personal best 2:34:43 timed at the Beijing World Athletics Championships last year, is already assured of a marathon place, if she wants to compete.Sudha earned $4,500 for overall seventh, Lalita and Nitendra $1,500.
