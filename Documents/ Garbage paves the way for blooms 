A ‘zero waste garden,’ mostly comprising flowering plants, has been set up at the vegetable farm under the Agriculture Department at Vandiperiyar, using biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes.Tyre, plastic bottles, and thermocol have been used to set up the garden. Bio-degradable waste is used in the form of manure.Farm superintendent N.S. Josh said the garden had been set up to draw attention to the environmental and health problems posed by dumping garbage in public places.“With a little care and an artistic mind, a beautiful garden can be even made out of garbage.“Not only flowering plants, but vegetables too can be grown,” he said.Even on a cement floor, a garden could be set up. Mr. Josh said seasonal flowering plants like petunia and seenia are best suited for growing using waste materials.The concept of the garden was developed by agriculture officer Jithin James and Suneesh.
