: Pro-Opposition State government employees and teachers would go on a day’s strike on Tuesday to press for implementation of the 10{+t}{+h}State Pay Commission report with retrospective effect.The strike is being led by the CPI(M)-led Kerala NGO Union and the CPI-led Joint Council of State Service Organisations (JCSSO) and other pro-Opposition organisations. They have accused the government of having subverted the principle of pay revision by delaying implementation of the 10{+t}{+h}Pay Commission report over six months ago. The Pay Commission was appointed in November 2013 with the promise of pay revision in six months. The government had extended the tenure of the Commission four times. The government has not so far taken a stand on when the Commission’s recommendations would take effect. It has also not responded positively to the employees’ demand that the ‘reactionary’ proposals of the Commission should be rejected, they say.The government has decided to invoke the ‘dies non’ (no work, no pay) principle to tackle the strike. Wages of those who join the strike would be cut from their February salary. It has also issued orders asking heads of departments not to grant leave to any employee or teacher on Tuesday other than for illness, illness of a close relative, examination, child delivery and other similar reasons. Leave for personal indisposition should be subject to certificates to be issued by qualified medical practitioners. The government has also directed District Collectors and heads of departments to provide protection to employees and teachers who report for duty. They have also been asked to report the names and posts of those who absent from work and seek police help to avert violent incidents in connection with the strike.In a statement here, NGO Union president P.H.M. Ismail and general secretary T.C. Mathewkutty said the employees and teachers would go on strike notwithstanding the government’s attempts to clamp down on the stir.
