The Machilipatnam Area Development Authority (MADA) Bill that was passed by the Assembly a month ago is waiting for the assent of Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan.Highly placed sources told The Hindu that the Bill had been tabled before the Governor for approval to set up the MADA, whose jurisdiction spreads across Machilipatnam and Pedana mandals in Krishna district in the first phase. The State government planned the MADA on the lines of the CRDA, which succeeded in acquiring land through Land Pooling System (LPS) in the case of Amaravati project without any dissent from private land owners.Initially, the MADA will focus on acquiring 14,500 acres of private land through LPS, ensuring better package and other benefits that were offered to the land owners in the Amaravati project. The entire 30,000 acres of land, including 14,500 acres of private land, to be acquired in the first phase falls in an area spreading across 21 villages, most of them dominated by fishermen and farmers.Of the 30,000 acres of the land to be acquired, a deep sea port was proposed in Machilipatnam rural mandal through PPP mode.
