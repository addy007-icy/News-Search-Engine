Members of the Young Indians of the Confederation of Indian Industry and the students of Periyar University jointly participated in the ‘Horn not OK Please’ (HNOP) campaign at the toll plaza near Omalur on Friday.The event was organised as part of the national volunteering week observance by the Young Indians.The student volunteers pasted the ‘HNOP’ stickers on all types of vehicles and also sensitised about ‘HNOP’ message. So, whoever puts the sticker on their car becomes an initiator of sorts since he cannot honk himself as he is supporting the cause and all the others around him also get involved.Often, honking is either unnecessary, or it serves no purpose. The vehicle users should make a conscious decision not to blare the horn, except when it is really necessary.During this sticker campaign, HNOP awareness was created among all type of vehicle riders.
