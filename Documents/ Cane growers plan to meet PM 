The State Sugarcane Growers’ Association has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to implement the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan panel report to ensure that farmers get fair price for their crops.It also appealed to Mr. Modi to hold discussions with agricultural scientists, officials and also farmers’ leaders to evaluate steps to ensure that farmers do not sustain loss so they remain motivated to continue with their occupation.Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar and general secretary Athahalli Devaraj, general secretary, said farmers would be demoralised if they did not get reasonable price for their crops. This was a major reason for many farmers becoming debt-ridden and taking the extreme step in the State, they said.Farmers, who sustained losses resorted to distress sale of lands and were migrating to urban areas seeking labour. This will have serious consequences, Mr. Shanthakumar said keeping in mind the food shortage in the coming years and growing requirement of the country. He also reminded the Prime Minister about the promise made in the election manifesto that minimum support price would be given to crops.There were many restrictions among banks to sanction agricultural loans, Mr. Shanthakumar said. He suggested that the government fix targets for each bank for providing agricultural loans and to also simplify the process. Then farmers would not go to private financiers seeking loans on higher interests, he said.The association plans to meet Mr. Modi to submit a memorandum.
