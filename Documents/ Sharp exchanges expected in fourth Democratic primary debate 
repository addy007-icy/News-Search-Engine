The Democratic candidates for president returned to the debate stage on Sunday night for the last matchup before the primary process begins next month, amid tightening poll numbers and an increasingly raucous race.With Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders gaining on longtime front-runner Hillary Clinton in the first two voting states, the debate marked a departure from the relatively civil exchanges that defined the last three face—offs with Ms. Clinton hitting Mr. Sanders over his past support for legislation that would reverse a 2005 law granting gun manufacturers legal immunity.The debate is scheduled to take place just blocks from the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where nine parishioners were killed during Bible study in a mass shooting last summer. Gun control has emerged as a central theme in the race, with Ms. Clinton citing the issue as one of the major differences between the candidates.Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has questioned Ms. Clinton’s liberal credentials, casting the former secretary of state as a Wall Street ally who will switch her position for political gain. But he’s vowed to forgo negative attacks, a position that may be hard to maintain as the race continues to intensify.Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will also be on the stage, which offers perhaps his last chance to improve his standing in the race. He’s been stuck in single digits since announcing his campaign last spring.
