Tamil Nadu advanced to the men’s semifinals of the Senior National basketball championship with a facile 82-50 victory over Gujarat on Thursday.The favourite was hardly troubled against an over-matched Gujarat side, and held a healthy lead throughout the encounter. Tamil Nadu faces defending champion Uttarakhand in the last-four on Friday, in what should be an electric contest between two equally-matched sides.Punjab, meanwhile, continued its merry march. A 104-77 rout of Kerala was achieved on the back of double-doubles from no less than three players — A. Bhullar (20 points, 10 rebounds), Gagandeep Gill (17, 14) and Ranbeer Singh (16, 10).Kerala did hold a 39-38 advantage at half-time, but was blown away after the restart. Punjab will take on Services in the second semifinal.In the women’s last-eight, Telangana cruised past Tamil Nadu 70-52. A tough Railways test, however, awaits Telangana in the semifinal.The match of the day came when a gritty Delhi edged Chhattisgarh out 84-76.
