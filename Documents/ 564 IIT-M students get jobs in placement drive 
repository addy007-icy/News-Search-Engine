In the first week of the ongoing placement programme at the Indian Institute of Technology – Madras, as many as 564 students have been placed. Last year, only 550 students were placed by the end of the first week.Offers in the core, public sector undertaking and research and development areas have accounted for 47 per cent of the offers. Of the 617 candidates who have been placed at least eight students have received three offers and 61 candidates had two offers each. According to Babu Viswanathan, advisor, placement at the IIT-Madras, Coal India has taken 13 candidates. “This year we took a conscious decision to increase core sector placement. Usually core sector placements are done in the second week. While the PSUs offer regular roles some companies have come specifically for research and development,” he said. In the second phase universities and colleges would come with teaching position offers for post graduate students. Going by the trend the second phase would also bring good results, Mr. Viswanathan said, adding, “Usually we hold the second phase in the second week of January but now we will have to rework the schedule.” The floods in the city had prevented the institute from holding its campus placement drive in December last.Last year, only550 studentswere placed bythe end of thefirst week
