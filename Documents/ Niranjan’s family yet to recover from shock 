The family of Lt. Col. E.K. Niranjan is yet to recover from the trauma they suffered following his tragic death in the recent Pathankot operation.Niranjan’s wife Radhika is still in shock. She can’t even get out of the bed to meet or greet the lonely visitors at her parent’s house at Paloor near Pulamanthol in the district. Visitors like Rishiraj Singh and Sivan Madathil spent some time with the family, consoling them. They tried their best to play with Niranjan's one-and-a-half-year-old daughter Vismaya.Dr. Radhika’s father Gopalakrishna Panicker, her brother Mahesh Kannan and his uncles tried hard to help her overcome the trauma. “We will seek some psychological counselling. The shock has been too much for her. Only time can heal it,” Mr. Panicker said caressing Vismaya in his hands.He said that he brought his daughter to his house largely to avoid the frequent visitors at Niranjan’s house at Palakkad.
