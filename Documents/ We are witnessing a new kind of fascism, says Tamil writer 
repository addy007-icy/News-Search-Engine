Noted Tamil writer C.S. Lakshmi, popularly known as Ambai, has condemned the banning of books and killing of authors describing it as a new kind of fascism.Delivering a keynote address at the three-day national conference on ‘Right to Write: The Culture and Literary Controversies and Controversial Literature’ organised by Department of English on Kakatiya University campus here on Friday, she said literary censorship leads to cultural anarchy. “The attempt by those who want to bar, threaten and burn books is to define culture in specific ways and fix its meaning and make it appear static,” she opined.Fixed frameworkAmbai said if words were entrapped in fixed framework, they cannot find wings to fly in many directions to perch on many trees.Controversies have been part of Tamil literary scene, she added.The three-day annual conference of Indian Association of Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies (IACLALS) was sponsored by the UGC.Welcoming the guests and participants, convener and Head of English Department, K. Damodar Rao said there were many instances of banning classics since ages. What was part of culture becomes corrupt and against culture in the course of time.However, the controversies kept the books alive. The conference seeks to debate on controversies surrounding issues of present life and what they meant.Professor K. Purushottam said controversy was beginning of development. “Every development is a kind of protest against that preceding it and hence one should welcome controversy and debate extensively rather stifling it,” he pointed out.About one hundred academics, writers and scholars would present nearly 40 research papers at the three-day conference on a wide range of issues.IACLALS chairman G.J.V. Prasad, vice-president Subhendu Mund, secretary Rina Ramdev and several others were present.
