The functioning of officials, especially those in the Rural Drinking Water Supply Department, came in for criticism at a Karnataka Development Programme review meeting here on Tuesday. Labour Minister P.T. Parmeshwar Naik, who is also in-charge of the district, was present.During the review of multi-village drinking water schemes, legislators such as E. Tukaram, N.Y. Gopalakrishna, Anil Lad, B. Nagaraj, and Bheema Naik, told the Minister that several schemes were moving at a slow pace.Hefty sumsThe inordinate delay was only depriving drinking water to the people in rural areas, though hefty sums had been released and spent on various schemes.Mr. Tukaram and Mr. Nagaraj said that though they had been raising the issue at meetings, nothing had happened.They urged the Minister to take a serious view over the issue and pull up the officials.Mr. Naik said that it was clear that the officials were not discharging their duties sincerely. “Are you [officials] here to get the work done or listen to the contractors?,” he asked.With regard to a scheme being executed in Nadivi in Sirguppa taluk, he asked the officials to blacklist the contractor and file a criminal case against him. He directed S.S. Nakul, zilla panchayat chief executive officer, to look into the matter and recommend disciplinary action against the officials for their laxity.Special meetingOn the suggestion of Mr. Gopalkrishna and Mr. Tukaram, Mr. Naik agreed to convene a special meeting exclusively to discuss the drinking water schemes.B. Anita and Mamata, zilla panchayat president and vice-president, Sameer Shukla, Deputy Commissioner, and R. Chetan, Superintendent of Police, were present.
