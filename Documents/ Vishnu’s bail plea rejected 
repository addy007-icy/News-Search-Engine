: Former MLA Malladi Vishnu suffered a setback in court in the spurious liquor case. The First Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail petition filed by Mr. Vishnu, who was Accused No. 9 in the case.Five persons died and 32 others were hospitalised after they consumed liquor at Swarna Bar and Restaurant in the city on December 7. The Krishnalanka police arrested nine persons including the cashiers, manager and other staff in the bar immediately after the incident.The government had constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by City Police Commissioner D. Gautam Sawang and DIG Mahesh Chandra Laddha. Vishnuâ€™s wife Kiranmayee, sister Lakshmi Saraswathi, and six others were being questioned in the case.The prosecution argued that police served notices to Mr. Vishnu and his family members under Section 160 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and asked them to cooperate with investigation. But, accused No.9 in the case has not appeared before the investigation officers. Even then the police have not raided his house and never tried to arrest him, so anticipatory bail is not necessary.The magistrate, after hearing the arguments, dismissed the bail petition and directed the accused to appear before the SIT.
