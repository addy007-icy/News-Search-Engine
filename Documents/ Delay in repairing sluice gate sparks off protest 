The farmers of Hasudi staged a protest in the village on Thursday against the delay in repairing the sluice gate of the Doddakere tank near the village.The tank is spread over an area of 93 acre in survey number 139 in the village. It provides irrigation for over 500 acre land in the village. Addressing the protest meet, Chandramouli H.N., a farmer from the village said a sluice gate was constructed for the tank 10 years ago for scientific management of water. It is unfortunate that, owing to the sub-standard work, the water was leaking from the sluice gate.‘No action’The villagers though had requested the authorities concerned many times to repair the sluice gate and arrest the leakage of water, but no action has been taken in this regard so far, he said.Road blockedThe farmers blocked the road that connects the village for some time as a token of protest. As a temporary measure to prevent the leakage of water, the farmers blocked the sluice gate with sand bags. They pressed the government to take up the work of repairing the sluice gate at the earliest.EncroachedThe protesters said that, the command area of the tank has been encroached by some influential persons and demanded for the clearance of the encroachment. Farmers Girish, Tyagaraj, Satyanarayana Bhat took part in the protest.
