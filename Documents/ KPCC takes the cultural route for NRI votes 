Aimed at targeting the Non Resident Indian vote bank in the United Arab Emirates ahead of the Assembly polls, the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) has constituted the Indian Cultural and Arts Society (INCAS), a feeder outfit to step up its political activities in the region.Barring the KPCC, all political parties including Indian Union Muslim League, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party from the State have their own NRI organisations in the UAE. “The reasons were manifold such as the UAE government disallowing an organisation in the name of the Congress party. Perhaps, its rulers did not want a political party to function on their soil,” said P.M. Suresh Babu, KPCC general secretary, who visited the UAE last week to commence the activities of INCAS.He said that Congress sympathisers and workers had over 50 associations in the UAE such as Kerala Nehru Forum, Veekshanam Forum and Kozhikode Priyadarshini. But the groups were at loggerheads with each other. When these conflicts reached a flashpoint, KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran either froze the organisations or asked the office bearers to disband their units. Subsequently, KPCC took the initiative to form an ad hoc committee of NRIs in the UAE.Now, formally a Congress- affiliated organisation came into being. C.R.G. Nair, has been named president of the UAE chapter. The party has been able to bring everyone under one umbrella, Mr. Babu said.Incidentally, the UAE has the largest population of Malayalis among the GCC nations. Its Malayali population is 7.75 lakh followed by Saudi Arabia (4.5 lakh); Kuwait (1.35 lakh); Oman (1.34 lakh) , Qatar (95,000) and Bahrain (60,000).
