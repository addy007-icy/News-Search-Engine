After being forced to put on hold its idea of a software-driven online examination system, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) has turned to the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and the National Informatics Centre (NIC) — public agencies — for the development of a comprehensive software to run its examinations.The KTU was forced to put on the backburner its proposal for an online exam system following robust protests from student and teacher organisations against the selection of a private agency to provide technical backup for the conduct of examinations.Following this, the KTU has been conducting its first semester B.Tech. examinations in the traditional manual mode.C-DAC is understood to have submitted two proposals to the KTU: one proposal — for Rs.2.5 crore — is for preparing the software for the conduct of examinations.However, as per this proposal, the KTU would have to provide for such infrastructure as high-speed scanners and high-speed printers in each college for printing the question papers and for scanning and uploading to the main server, answer sheets of each examination.Second proposalThe second proposal is for a whopping Rs.90 crore under which C-DAC would take full responsibility for the conduct of all KTU examinations for two years. This includes the development of the examination software and the hardware required in all 154 colleges under the KTU.The NIC is understood to have informally given a proposal for Rs.1 crore for the development of a software to run KTU examinations.“Once we receive the NIC’s formal proposal also, our e-governance committee would meet and evaluate them. Then we would present the matter to the government for it to take an appropriate decision,” KTU Pro Vice Chancellor M. Abdul Rahman told The Hindu .Proposal for online exam system put on the back-burner following robust protests
