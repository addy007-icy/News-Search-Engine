The Mysore Industries Association (MIA) and other stakeholders in the district will approach the State government against regularising residential layout development in industrial areas.MIA General Secretary Suresh Kumar Jain told The Hindu that the association had already approached the High Court and the issue was pending before it. “The subject has been raised with senior officials in the past and during every pre-budget consultations,” he said.Housing and related activities were taking place more than industrial activities in the industrial areas of Visvesvaranagar, Bannimantap Industrial Area and Yadavgiri Industrial Area, all of which were outside the purview of the Mysuru City Corporation when they were planned and developed decades ago.As a result of easy conversion of land usage, housing activity is proliferating in industrial zones, he said.The stakeholders, including MIA and CII, have been urged to apprise the government of the problems as a fallout of such zoning violation and caution them against regularising such colonies and nullify the efforts of the real estate lobby and other vested interest groups from encroaching into industrial plots.“The matter is of utmost importance and is coming at a time when manufacturing sector is fighting a fierce battle to survive due to dumping of low cost goods from China and other countries and the economy is under recovery phase. Under these circumstances, industries need the support from all stakeholders, including society for co-existence,” according to M. Vijay Kumar, Deputy MD of Mysore Polymers & Rubber Products Ltd.He said that existing residents in the adjoining areas should be apprised of the environment norms applicable to the industrial area and to desist from making unfounded or baseless complaints on flimsy grounds after having occupied areas contiguous to industries. The other demands of the industry include an end to usurpation of industrial area for housing colonies, discussion with the pollution control board to rectify the existing anomalies in allotment and conversion of land.
