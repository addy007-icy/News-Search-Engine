R. Raghu, BJP leader and former chairman of Karnataka Exhibition Authority, alleged that the Congress and JD(S) had an internal understanding in the elections to the Legislative Council. He said this was the main reason for his narrow defeat in the polls.Mr. Raghu said that apart from having an understanding with the JD(S), the Congress leaders threatened of initiating disciplinary action against the members of the local bodies if they voted in favour of the BJP. The Congress had allegedly cautioned its voters that they had installed CCTV cameras in all the booths, he said, adding that the Congress had manipulated and won the elections by threatening its voters.‘Crooked strategy’Besides, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who had sensed that the BJP was ahead of other parties in the elections, had called upon Congress workers not to caste the second preferential vote. One could imagine the “crooked strategy” adopted by Mr. Siddaramaiah to defeat the BJP in the elections, Mr. Raghu said.He said that he had secured over 2,000 votes even though he did get the support of his party MLAs in Mysuru and Chamarajnagar.If the Congress and JD(S) had played a fair role in the elections, he would have won it, he said.While thanking BJP leaders, including B.S. Yedduyrappa, Shobha Karandlaje, Somanna, Pratap Simha, Pralhad Joshi and others for campaigning on behalf of him, Mr. Raghu said he would strengthen the party from the grassroots level.
