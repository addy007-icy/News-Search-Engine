The Egg Stop. The name, says it all. Egg-shaped wall art, a decor of yellow and white, bright yellow oval plates and a yellow menu card packed with egg delicacies –it is eggs all the way at the recently opened The Egg Stop cafe on Keston road.There is much to savour. From the classic French, to the exotic Mexican, there are a dozen different Omelettes to choose from.Egg Stop’s buttery French Omelette, artistically folded into a layered roll and served with vegetables and bread, is delicious.The menu has a more than a few scrumptious meat-infused omelettes. Smoked Beef, and Chicken Sausage Omelette are two such fusions of egg and meat which will send your taste buds flying.For those who want something even more diverse, Egg Stop offers the variedly spicy Mexican Omelette, a succulent piece of art filled with vegetables that blends the tanginess of tomatoes with a fiery gravy and flanked by two pieces of toasted bread.An assortment of other egg dishes ranging from the simple bread’s eye to heavier ones like burgers and rolls are there too. A special section of dishes, which are based on egg white, provides healthier alternatives to those fitness conscious folk.However, the affair with eggs doesn’t stop there. It extends into beverages too. The cold shakes, blended with egg white, available in coffee, strawberry and chocolate flavours or the minty egg soda, provides the perfect topping for a particularly ‘eggy’ meal. Regular tea, coffee and green tea is on the list as well.The cafe chain, present in three countries and with more than 10 outlets in Kerala, is the brain child of public health expert Dr. M.A. Babu. The company is planning to open four more cafes in the city. The outlet at Keston road is open on all days of the week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
