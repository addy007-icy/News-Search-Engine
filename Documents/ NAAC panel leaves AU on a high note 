The eight-member team from National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) completed its assessment tour of the 90-year-old Andhra University here on Thursday.Appreciating the efforts of the faculty-starved university, Chairman of the NAAC Committee S.F. Patil heaped praises on the Vice-Chancellor, his team, and the overall functioning of the university at the exit meeting.This has triggered a speculation that AU will get a better score over the last NAAC score. The last NAAC visit was in 2008, and AU was given ‘A Plus’ grading with a score of 3.65 on the scale of 4.“We expect to better the score and may go up to 3.85 to 3.9 after this visit,” said Vice-Chancellor G.S.N. Raju.It is learnt that the NAAC panel was particularly happy with the functioning of all the 65 departments and 15 centres, and this despite the university running with just about 50 per cent of its total faculty strength.
