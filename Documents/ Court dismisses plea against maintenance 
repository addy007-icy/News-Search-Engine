A Sessions court here has dismissed an appeal against a Metropolitan Magistrate court order asking the husband of a woman to pay to her Rs. 7,500 and Rs. 4,000 to her child per month as maintenance under the Domestic Violence Act.Dismissing the appeal filed by the woman’s husband, Kartik Bhardwaj, District and Sessions Judge Rekha Rani said: “Since the appellant has left no stone unturned and has tried every trick in the trade to conceal his income and did not disclose his financial status honestly and truthfully, the trial court was obviously left with no option but to make a reasonable assessment of maintenance in the facts and circumstances of the case, and as such I do not find any infirmity in the impugned order.”The sub-ordinate court had also made a similar observation while granting maintenance to the woman, Mamta Bhardwaj, and her child.The husband had tried to conceal his income with a view to escape or minimise his liability of maintaining his wife and the child, the Metropolitan Magistrate court had observed.While hearing the appeal against the Magistrate court order, the superior court had the husband’s income proofs examined and found all of them doubtful.The couple had married in 2009, and a male child was born to them in 2011. Three years later in 2014, she was thrown out of her matrimonial home after allegedly being subjected to physical and mental torture by her husband. She and her child have been living with her parents since then, the woman said in her complaint seeking maintenance.She claimed that her husband along with her father owned a sanitary pipes and cement store and earned Rs. one lakh per month.The woman’s husband had challenged the maintenance order, submitting that the subordinate court had assessed his income between Rs. 22,000 and 24,000 per month without any documents.
