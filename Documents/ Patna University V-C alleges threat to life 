The Vice-Chancellor of Patna University, Prof. (Dr.) Y.C. Simhadri, has not attended office for four months. After many “violent attacks” on him, he “feels life threat everyday, every hour.” Even with security guards around him, he is unable to go to his office, just a few yards away from his official residence on the university campus, he claims. Prof. Simhadri was earlier Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University, Nagarjuna University and the Benaras Hindu University. It is his second term as V-C of Patna University — his first stint was from November 2006 to January 2008.He joined Patna University on January 31, 2014, “to clear the mess and malaise afflicting the university since long.” He claims that after he joined the varsity, he was intimidated, abused and attacked .“It is a section of the non-teaching staff who have created such an atmosphere in the university.,” he says.“Students do not create any problem, barring a few who are politically associated,” he said.
