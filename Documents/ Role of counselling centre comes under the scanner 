About five months ago, the University of Hyderabad appointed a counsellor to help students facing problems, including depression. ‘So why didn’t Rohit go there if he was depressed?’ is a question on some minds on the campus.The efficiency of the varsity of identifying and helping depressed students is now being questioned by some of Rohit’s friends, who say that in spite of having such a facility, it proved to be of no use. “Unless a friend brings it to the notice of the authorities, it will go unnoticed. In Rohit’s case, maybe the letter he wrote to the Vice-Chancellor should have been a sign, but it went unnoticed,” said a close friend of his, unwilling to be named.Ramji, president of the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), and who Rohit had mentioned in his suicide note, said that he did not recall the deceased going for counselling in the recent past. “He did not show any signs of being depressed,” he added.“Many students are not even aware that there is a counsellor to help them,” pointed out Vijay (name changed) who was protesting near the Shopping Complex in UoH on Tuesday. According to UoH officials, the counsellor was appointed after another Dalit research scholar, M. Venkatesh, committed suicide by consuming a poisonous substance in November 2013, after being depressed over not being provided a guide.When contacted, UoH officials were unable to confirm whether Rohit had approached the counsellor, but said that if he had done so, then records will show the same. When asked how depressed or troubled students are identified for counselling, a senior official said: We are informed about it through their friends, or some times by faculty members who notice changes in student’s behaviour.
