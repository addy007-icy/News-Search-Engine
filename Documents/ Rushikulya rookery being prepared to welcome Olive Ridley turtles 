The beach near Rushikulya rookery coast in Ganjam district of Odisha is being cleaned up to prepare it for the nesting season of Olive Ridley turtles.According to Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Ashis Behera, the coastline of over 10 kms from Purunabandha to Prayagi at Rushikulya rookery coast is to be cleaned up. All items that can harm the mother Olive Ridleys like sharp pieces and various forms of garbage including polythene waste would be removed. Forest officials have started the process and volunteers as well as students would be involved, the DFO said.Nets would be placed at the beach for a stretch of over five kms from Gokharkuda to Podampeta to check straying of the turtles from sandy beach to land during their nesting. This year the forest department has decided to allow tourists to visit the coast to see turtles only at Podampeta.Mass nesting is expected to start by end of February. As sporadic nesting before that, three artificial hatcheries have already been established by the forest department. The whole coastline has been divided into 50 segments and around 100 staff of forest department along with volunteers would monitor these segments for enumeration and protection of mother turtles.Patrolling in sea through two speed boats and trawlers with support of Coast Guard has been intensified to check illegal entry of fishing trawlers into the sea near this coastline.
