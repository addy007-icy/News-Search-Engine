Chitradurga Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Nitesh Patil has said that contractors will be blacklisted and criminal cases will be filed against them if they fail to install quality solar lamps in the district.Speaking at general body meeting of the zilla panchayat here on Saturday, he said that some members had complained that low quality solar lamps had been purchased by the contractors. They demanded action against the contractors and recovery of the money paid to them. Mr. Patil said that according to the members, 45 solar lamps were installed in Challakere taluk of which only 10 were working. The contract was given to a private company in Bengaluru. “The members have alleged that the officers only threaten to file criminal cases against contractors but do not take action against them,” he said.Zilla panchayat member Dyamanna alleged that steps had not been taken to provide three-wheelers to people with disabilities. The panchayat had been setting aside 3 per cent of its budget for providing three-wheelers to the disabled. “The officers are keen to release funds for construction of buildings and other works. They are not ready to work for people with disabilities,” he alleged.Women and Child Welfare Department Deputy Director Parameshwarappa said that 24 beneficiaries would get the three-wheelers if the funds were released before January 20. The beneficiaries should undergo medical examination and get proper certificates for getting three-wheelers, he added.
