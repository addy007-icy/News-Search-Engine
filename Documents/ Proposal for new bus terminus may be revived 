The new Kozhikode Corporation Council has taken the lead to revive the proposal for a bus terminus near Kozhikode Medical College. The proposal had been put on the back burner for the last few months after it was cancelled by the State government in late 2014 as the project had failed to take off even two years after it was approved.The bus terminus near the Medical College, along with another one in Meenchanda, was proposed as early as 2004 to put an end to the traffic snarls at both junctions. A group of non-resident Keralites under the banner Malabar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Minfra) had come forward to invest in the project, which envisaged a shopping complex-cum-bus terminus. Around 2.5 acres of land was acquired near the Medical College for the project. The estimated cost of construction was Rs.30 crore at the time.Inactivity of investorsHowever, it took seven years for the project to receive the nod of the Chief Town Planner, after it was rejected thrice citing various technicalities. But the inactivity of the investors had forced the State government to withdraw the approval later.JD(U) councillor P. Kishenchand brought the project to the councilâ€™s attention once again on Friday. Brushing aside allegations by various quarters that the investors had real estate interests on the acquired property, Mr. Kishenchand proposed at the council that the Corporation should acquire the said property and go ahead with the project in its own manner.The council accepted his suggestion and decided to discuss the topic at another meeting of the council.
