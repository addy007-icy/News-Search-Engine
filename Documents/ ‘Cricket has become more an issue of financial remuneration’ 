Dismissing a petition moved by Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited challenging the suspension of the CSK team from IPL tournament for two years, the Madras High Court Bench observed that cricket was once referred to as a “gentlemen’s game” but has now evolved from the more traditional concept of test matches to 20-over matches.“The game went through a sea change in the sense it became more an issue of entertainment and higher financial remuneration to cricketers and administrators of the game,” the judges added.The Bench then pointed out that the Supreme Court delivered its order appointing the Lodha Committee to decide on the quantum of punishment to be imposed on Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra of Rajasthan Royals and the respective teams on January 22, 2015. But the transfer of ownership of the CSK team was made only on February 20, 2015 through an agreement. The petitioner was nowhere in the picture when the order was passed. If it was not in the picture, where could be the question of it being an aggrieved party, which can seek redressal in appropriate judicial proceedings? Thus, this very premise that the petitioner can claim any independent right as an aggrieved party is clearly unsustainable,” the Bench said.Noting that the petitioner must sink and swim with the findings against the Indian Cements Limited, the original owner of the team, the Bench dismissed the plea as not maintainable.The court also dismissed a PIL petition moved by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy challenging the suspension of CSK on the same grounds.
