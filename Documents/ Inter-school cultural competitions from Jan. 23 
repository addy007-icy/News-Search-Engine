Following a positive feedback from children and sponsors, we registered Kriya Society in 2007 and started granting scholarships to meritorious students from poor financial background,” Mr. Rao said, adding that enormous response from children, parents and teachers to the district-level festival had promoted the society to upgrade the event to the State-level.“Advance registration is mandatory, as we have to make preparations accordingly. Registrations can be done over phone at 72888-22399 and 72888-22499. Details can be had from our website www.kriyaonline.org,” he said. Kriya Society joint secretary P. Jagannadha Raju, members T.V.
