Around 20 to 25 artists are beautifying the walls of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Ashok Nagar by painting pictures of achievers from various walks of life.“Apart from painting images of achievers, the artists also painted in details about them, including the prestigious awards conferred on them,” Meenakshi Sundaram, one of the artists, said.The work on beautifying the walls was started before the floods. Work on one of the walls was completed, before it collapsed in rain. The wall is now being re-constructed. Once it is finished, we will take up painting work, he said.“We are beautifying the walls out of our own interest; we are on a mission to keep the neighbourhood clean. This exercise will help students learn more about these achievers and get inspired by then,” said Jayapriya Devi, another artist.We are beautifying the walls out of our own interest.Jayapriya DeviArtist
