City Police Commissioner D. Gautam Sawang has promised that police take action only against the crooked moneylenders only, adding that rather they will encourage the private lenders who are providing financial assistance to farmers, petty vendors and the poor and do their business in the right way .“We have verified the promissory notes, cheques and stamp papers confiscated from lenders during raids.In the promissory notes, moneylenders clearly mentioned that they are giving the loan on 3 per cent interest before taking the signatures of borrowers. Police observed that some private moneylenders are organising the trade very genuinely,” he said.In several villages, many vegetable, fruit and other small vendors are dependant on moneylenders and they repay the loans promptly.Police will react in the cases where the organisers resort to illegal activities or crimes such as sexual harassment, torture and extortions in the pretext of loan recovery.“We don’t want to disturb the money lending business instead we will encourage the organisers, if they offer loans at reasonable interest rates. Police observed that many lenders have stopped the business after the racket was unearthed, due to which petty vendors are suffering,” Mr. Sawang said.“If any money lender resorts to detainment, forcibly taking signatures finger prints of the victims, collect property documents, use bouncers, attach properties illegally or sexually abuse women victims, police will take severe action against the money lenders,” the City Police Commissioner warned.
