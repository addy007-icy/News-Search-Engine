Srinivas Murthy, senior vice president of marketing at e-commerce major Snapdeal, has put in his papers to start his own venture.“The entrepreneurial drive has rubbed off onto me. I’m now moving on to become an entrepreneur myself,” Mr Murthy said.He, however, did not disclose any further details, adding that he would announce his venture in the next few months.“Srini has decided to begin an exciting new journey as an entrepreneur, and while he will surely be missed, I am delighted to see that he is carrying forward the Snapdeal spirit of entrepreneurship,” Snapdeal co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Kunal Bahl said.This is the second major exit at Snapdeal after its head of strategy Ranjan Kant quit to join online apparel retailer Jabong as its chief marketplace officer.The e-commerce space in the country has been witnessing significant churn at the executive level with players often bringing professionals onboard with varied experience levels.Snapdeal itself has roped in senior leaders from across the globe.Anand Chandrasekaran, ex-CPO Bharti Airtel, Gaurav Gupta, formerly the India head of Bay area startup Scalearc, and Bhuvan Gupta, ex-CTO of BSB Portal (JV between BSB and Yahoo Japan), have joined Snapdeal as core members of its technology team over the past one year. —PTI
