The restructuring of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee seems the first challenge for the new president, Capt. Amarinder Singh.The final list of office-bearers, including vice-presidents, general secretaries and district presidents, has been sent to the central leadership.After taking over from Pratap Singh Bajwa, Capt. Amarinder Singh dissolved the PCC last month and said fresh office-bearers would be nominated.However, party insiders say the disbanding of the unit, when the Assembly polls are just over a year away, has not gone down well with some workers, especially those backing Mr. Bajwa. Sources in the party say many feel that the party should have continued with the present set-up, spending the time needed for the restructuring on strengthening the organisation for the elections.What is more, the delay in the reshuffle has helped the Aam Aadmi Party woo the second-rung leaders of the Congress, who bring in “visibility,” say a source.Capt. Amarinder Singh told The Hindu: “The list of recommendations for the new set-up has been sent to the high command, which will take the final decision.”Sources say Capt. Amarinder is unlikely to make drastic changes because he wants to involve leaders from different regions and communities in the preparations for the elections.
