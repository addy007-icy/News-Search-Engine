If you are an Apple user, get ready to experience your Facebook Timeline in 3D soon. According to reports, the social networking site is rolling out a special feature “3D Touch” to its Timeline.So instead of tapping and swiping, “3D Touch” will allow users to hard-press on items to preview content and then optionally act on it, Tech Crunch reported.The feature will work with web links, profiles, Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups, Facebook Events, photos, profile pictures and cover photos.To begin with, Apple users will be able to press on links and profiles and preview content without having to navigate away from their current spot.“We are excited to start rolling out support for 3D Touch in our iOS app so people can quickly and easily peek into a preview of anything they are interested in on Facebook, and pop into that content to see more,” a Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.Initially, “3D Touch” on the Timeline will be available to a “small group” of people and will later expand to more users.This previewing feature was earlier called “peek and pop” and introduced on Apple’s new smartphones last year.
