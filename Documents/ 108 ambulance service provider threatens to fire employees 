GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI), which runs the 108 ambulance service, has threatened to fire 900 of its employees if they fail to sign an agreement and follow their terms and conditions.The employees had begun a protest on Monday urging the authorities to increase their salaries.Syed Suhale Parveez, Senior Manager of GVK EMRI, said that the workers had to sign a contract to ensure that they would be "disciplined and take calls on time, and ensure that they were well groomed."GVK EMRI plans to recruit 900 new drivers and paramedics.The association members have taken strong objection to this and have said that they would not call off their strike and have demanded extra payment after 12 hours of work.
