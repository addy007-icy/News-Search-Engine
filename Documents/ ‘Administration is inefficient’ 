“Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is a big liar. He lies about his achievements and also about lack of support from the Union government,” Jagadish Shettar, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, said here on Tuesday. He was here to address a party workers meet. “Till now, we used to say that M. Veerappa Moily was a ‘liar Chief Minister’ (Sullugara Mukhyamantri). But Mr. Siddaramaiah has beat him being a ‘bigger liar Chief Minister’ (Maha Sullugara Mukhyamantri),” Mr. Shettar said. Reading out from a sheet of paper, he said that the Union government had released Rs. 1,900 crore as crop loss compensation and input subsidy. “The State government has spent only around 10 per cent of this amount till now. The administrative machinery is so inefficient that it is unable to spend grants received from the Centre, leave alone spend its own money,” he said. If only the State had released money in time, many a farmer could have been saved from committing suicide, Mr. Shettar said.
