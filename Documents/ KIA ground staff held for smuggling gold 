According to the officials, Lateef handed over a bag to Ajesh, a member of the ground handling staff, before undergoing a body scan. According to custom officials, Lateef came by Emirates Airways Flight EK-568. He handed over gold biscuits to Ajesh while walking through the aero-bridge.

Now it is mandatory for everyone to walk through the DFMD,” said a senior customs official. Preliminary investigations revealed that Ajesh had been working in the airport for the past three years. Police are investigating if he was involved in other such cases. The arrested persons were produced before a magistrate in a Special Court for Economic Offences and remanded in judicial custody until January 27.During the current financial year, the Customs Air Intelligence Unit at KIA has arrested 106 persons and seized about 95 kilograms of smuggled gold valued at Rs. 25.16 crores.
