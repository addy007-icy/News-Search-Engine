S tars and their shenanigans, on screen and off, have a dedicated viewership. Every channel has a plethora of programmes in various formats that still do not satiate the hunger for stardust. Kairali TV’s ‘Loudspeaker’ is one such programme that thrives on happenings in tinsel town. But it does not believe in singing the praise of our celebrities. Instead there are hints of spice and tart that gives the show a different flavour altogether.Ullas Kovoor, producer of the show, talks about ‘Loudspeaker’, which now inches towards the 250-epsiode mark, and also about ‘Patturumaal’, a music-reality show on Mappilapattu, which he produces.Behind the scenes…While working as producer of ‘Patturumaal’ on Kairali TV, I was asked to come up with a show on film celebrities. We wanted something different. I had several brainstorming sessions with executive producer Santosh Pali before zeroing in on a concept that would entertain and inform without becoming a catty session of only gossip and innuendos. Thus was the 30-minute show ‘Loudspeaker’ conceptualised.What is ‘Loudspeaker’ about?It has been visualised as a sit-com with two main characters, Salpperu Susheela and her domestic help Salpperu Thangu. Through their conversation, viewers get to hear the latest in Mollywood. But the show is not a kind of publicity vehicle for movies or stars. The entire tone of the programme is irreverent and there are no sacred cows. So while Susheela, enacted by Anjana Appukuttan, and Thangu, essayed by Reshmi, exchange notes about the latest about our stars, Susheela has a private eye called Jamalu, who collects all the news, gossip, rumours et al, about celebrities. Guests drop in, they enhance the content of the show and add a dash of humour. The minute Susheela has doubts, she turns to Jamlu for help. His identity is not revealed (laughs).So not all the stars are happy about the show?No. Some have called up and registered their protests. Jamalu might be in for a hard time if they find out who he is! Even his voice has been disguised. But then a senior star like Balachandra Menon sir called us up and congratulated us for going ahead with a concept that shows Mollywood in its true colours, warts and all. Fans associations are not quite comfortable with our show but, so far, the management has never interfered and has always supported the team behind ‘Loudspeaker’.How do you ensure that the show does not become a platform for malicious gossip?We have our sources in the industry. Whenever we get a contentious bit of news, we check and double check before including it in our show.What is your contribution to ‘Patturumaal’?It was an award-winning show by the time I started working in it. I have tried to enrich its creative content by creating innovative rounds that make participants delve into the rich heritage of Mappilapattu. We have a panel of experts to help us. I also take care of grooming sessions to see that our participants get the best of guidance and help to hone their talent.( ‘Loudspeaker’ is telecast at 7.30 p.m., from Monday to Thursday, on Kairali TV)
