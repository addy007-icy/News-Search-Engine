The economics of classical dance performances at the State school arts festival is dizzying. Parents are on a splurge, spending huge amounts on costumes and ornaments, in their bid to make their wards stand out from the rest.“Getting a costume for the event on a rental basis is a thing of the past. Parents who can afford to spend more have no hesitation in buying expensive costumes and ornaments. We received a large number of orders days in advance for buying costly materials. The parents suggest the design and type of material to be bought,” said Kalyanaraman, managing partner of Chamayam dance collections.According to Kalamandalam Seemasen, parents sometimes spent anywhere between Rs.35,000 and Rs.40,000 for a dance event at the State school arts festival. The price of costume ranges from Rs.8,000 to Rs.15,000. Then there is the cost involved in stitching the costume, the make-up and the ornaments.“I know students who have participated in multiple dance events. So imagine the money spent for being on the stage. The trend is to get new and fashionable designs,” she said.And it is not because there is a dearth of cheaper material. Costume material is available from Rs.1,000 to Rs.2,000.Bindhu, a resident of Malappuram, whose daughter participated in Kuchipudi and Mohiniyattam at the festival, said it was the attitude that mattered. “Some think expensive costumes can make a difference in performance. Maybe it works, but I spent only about Rs.6,000 to Rs.8,000 for an event,” she said.However, the tightening of purse strings on costumes and ornaments did not help her in limiting the overall expenditure. She had to spend Rs.20,000 for going for appeal.Parents are on a splurge, spending huge amounts for classical dance performances.
