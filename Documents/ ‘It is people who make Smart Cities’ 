Harnessing the power of citizens and pushing for great deals and not settling for the second best are among the eight guiding principles suggested on the basis of an ethnographic survey conducted on Smart Cities.“Citizens’ partnership is important, and as many as 1.5 million suggestions have reached the Prime Minister’s website on this issue,” Additional Secretary (Smart Cities) of the Ministry of Urban Development Sameer Sharma informed a plenary session on smart urban housing-meeting the felt needs and beyond: preparing for rapid urbanisation, on the second day of the Sunrise Andhra Pradesh Partnership Summit here on Monday.The rest of the guidelines, Dr. Sameer Sharma said, were being announced at a public forum for the first time, treating every interaction with people as an opportunity to learn; involving every one, including bureaucracy and politicians, and not going alone; without treating the smart city project as “government as usual” but with pragmatism and inspiration; setting municipal officers up for services and treating every Indian city as unique.“Smart City is not a business or a technical mission. It should come from you,” he said while emphasising the need for involvement of people and administrators. Three important criteria for a smart city are better liveability, better transport and less pollution, Dr. Sharma said.Earlier, co-chairman of the CII national committee on real estate and housing Neel Raheja said by 2020 urban population will be more than 40 per cent of the country’s population. This situation will throw up several challenges and planning.Joint Secretary (Housing) of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said the Ministry is planning to delegate the issue of permit for construction to local bodies.
