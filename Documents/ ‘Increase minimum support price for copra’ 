To help coconut farmers get good income, the Central Government should increase the price of copra to Rs. 100 a kg and consider imposing a ban on import of palm kernels, former Union Minister S.R. Balasubramoniyan has said.In his letter to the Union Minister of Agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, he said that from Rs. 50 – 51 a kg a few years ago, the minimum support price (MSP) had increased to only Rs. 55, which hurt the coconut farmers and turned coconut cultivation economically unviable.While the increase in MSP is only around eight per cent, the rise in production cost of coconut oil had gone up by 60 – 80 per cent. The cost of labour had also increased by 30 per cent in the past few years.In addition to the increase in production cost and labour, the farmers were also hurt by the import of palmoline oil and palm kernels as the oil at Rs. 50 a kg led to mix of palmoline oil with groundnut oil and coconut oil and sale of the mixed product as pure groundnut oil and coconut oil, Mr. Balasubramoniyan said and claimed to have proof of the same.Net resultThe net result was that the palmoline lobby made a rich harvest while the coconut farmers suffered.The former Minister pointed out that during Atal Bihari Vajpayee tenure as Prime Minister import of palm kernels was banned and wanted the present Government to reintroduce the ban.
