The five Electricity Supply Companies (Escoms) have sought a hike in tariff of Rs. 1.02 per unit. There is already a hue and cry over it, with much of the opposition being pegged to no major improvements in service. But will this opposition translate into participation where it matters — at the public hearing?With the number of participants in public hearings for tariff revision plummeting, the Karnataka Electricity Governance Network (KEGN) has come up with a citizens’ guide, which not only seeks to encourage greater participation, but also simplifies the process.It breaks down the components that go into calculating the tariff and explains the process of tariff determination – from the time power utilities file their application to the procedure to participate in public hearings.“Tariff determination has a far-reaching impact throughout the electricity sector. It not only affects the financial viability of the sector and the quality and affordability of consumer services, but also raises social and environmental concerns,” the guide says. Y.G. Muralidharan from KEGN said, “With the hike being proposed this time being one of the steepest in recent times, it is imperative for consumers to collect more information apart from what has been published. Deciphering the tariff is a big process. People will have to talk to retired officials or technical experts to gain more knowledge.”While the network is in the process of publishing the guide, with hard copies expected to be available in a week’s time (the cost is likely to be between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15), for now, interested consumers can write tocontactcreat@gmail.comfor soft copies.
