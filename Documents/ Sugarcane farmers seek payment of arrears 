Sugarcane farmers who cultivated the crop last year under Trident Sugars Limited have urged the district administration to get involved and get their arrears released.Large number of famers from Zaheerabad arrived here on Monday and met Collector D. Ronald Rose.In a memorandum submitted to the Collector, the farmers said that they were yet to be paid Rs. 260 per tonne by the management.“The management has been offering a price of Rs. 2,500 per tonne, instead of Rs. 2,600, as announced by the government. Similarly, majority of us are dependent on sugarcane and hence we should be paid once in 15 days,” the farmers urged the Collector.They also asked the Collector to see that insurance be implemented with village as a unit, and sought sanction of drip irrigation facility.
