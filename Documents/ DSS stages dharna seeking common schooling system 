The members of the Karnataka Dalit Sangharhsa Samiti (Ambedkarvada) staged a dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner’s Office on Monday demanding the implementation of a common schooling system and putting an end to closure of government schools. The dharna was held as part of the 185th birth anniversary celebrations of social reformer Savitribai Phule.Addressing the protesters, Sundar Master, State organising of DSS, said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was busy announcing schemes such as Anna Bhagya and Ksheera Bhagya.These “Bhagya” schemes had their own place. But, providing proper school facilities for children belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was more important, he saidThe architect of Indian Constitution, B.R. Ambedkar, had emphasised on providing free and compulsory education.Hence, it was necessary to have a common schooling system. Instead of closing down government schools, their quality should be increased to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas.The burden on teachers should be reduced, he said.Most government schools now impart education in Kannada medium, while private schools taught in English. While teaching in mother-tongue should be encouraged and protected, it was also necessary to teach English to students. Teachers with good command over English should be appointed to government schools, he said.
