The Goa Children’s Court on Tuesday reserved for Thursday the order on the anticipatory bail application filed by pop star Remo Fernandes in the child verbal abuse case. Public Prosecutor while strongly opposing the anticipatory bail application of Fernandes submitted to the court that his custodial interrogation was necessary as he had not appeared before the police for the last five days to join the investigation.The petition was filed by lawyer-activist Aires Rodrigues for court monitoring of the investigation i > n the child verbal abuse case.Advocate Rajeev Gomes appearing on behalf of Fernandes submitted to the court on Tuesday that he was willing to comply with all the conditions laid down by the Court including an enhanced surety.Gomes further argued that the road accident on December 1 was not account of fault of Remo’s son but due to the buffaloes which were crossing the road. > The victim was trying to extort money from him due to his celebrity status, Gomes alleged.Terming the contents of Remo’s anticipatory bail application as a bunch of lies and false accusations, Rodrigues submitted to the court “documentary evidence on record that establishes beyond doubt that Jonah, son of Mr. Fernandes was driving in a very rash and negligent manner.”He submitted to the court that Mr. Fernandes was fabricating a fake defence in an attempt to desperately try and save his son from the charges of rash and negligent driving. He also urged the court to put Remo Feranndes to strict terms so that he does not flee from facing the due process of law.Fernandes is accused of having verbally abused 17-year old minor girl Helan D’Souza of Malvan who while on a pilgrimage to Old Goa by walk was knocked down by the car driven by Jonah Fernandes, in which Remo Fernandes was also travelling.The Mapusa Police have already registered an offence of rash and negligent driving against Jonah Fernandes under Sections 279 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code.The grievously injured victim has undergone multiple operations on her head and legs at the State-run Goa Medical college.
