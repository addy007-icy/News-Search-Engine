Putting speculation about an alliance with the Congress in West Bengal at rest, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in New Delhi on Sunday said the party would stick to the “political-tactical” line that it adopted in its 21st Congress.Under the new strategy, the CPI(M) would oppose the “right-wing offence” carried out by the ruling BJP and would “continue” to fight the Congress for pursuing “neo-liberal policies”.In a press communiqué, the CPI(M) said the Polit Bureau and the Central Committee would take a decision at an “appropriate time” on how to fight the upcoming Assembly elections in various States.In West Bengal, the CPI(M) reportedly sent feelers to the Congress at the end of its plenum to figure out whether the party would be keen on coming together to defeat the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress. Even former Chief Minister of the State and veteran Communist leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had called upon the Congress and the Left Front to join hands.However, the issue of an alliance with the Congress brought into the open strong differences among the Left parties, including the Left Front’s traditional constituents.While the All India Forward Bloc and the Communist Party of India are against any alliance with the Congress, the Revolutionary Socialist Party has expressed support for it. AIFB general secretary Debabrata Biswas criticised the CPI(M) leadership for making “such open offers to the Congress”.
