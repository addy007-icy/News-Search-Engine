The State government on Monday informed the Kerala High Court that the investigation into the death of a member of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) in Kannur due to a gunshot wound suffered by him during a firing practice session had been completed.The State government made the submission when a writ petition seeking a directive to the police to expedite investigation into the case came up for hearing. A first-year degree student from Kannur, Anas had sustained serious injuries at the NCC camp held on the campus of a private college at Koothuparamba in September 2014. Anas was injured during a firing practice session at the camp. A bullet fired by another cadet at the instance of the commanding officer hit Anas who was assigned the duty of clearing the field and repairing the target.Meanwhile, the Centre government submitted that the Director General of NCC had issued directives to initiate disciplinary action against Col. S.K. Saini, Officer Commanding(OC) 31 Kerala Battalion NCC, and Subaidar Behari Lal of 31 Kerala Battalion for their gross negligence in the conduct of firing which resulted in the death of Anas.The writ petition was filed by Anasâ€™ father M. Kunhammad of Vadakara. He alleged that though a case was registered at the Koothuparamba police station, the investigation into case was on the wrong track. Though the police had arrested Behari Lal, he was later released on bail, the petitioner said.The petitioner alleged there was an attempt to wind up the case on the ground that the boy had died of an unidentified disease, and that his death could not be attributed to gunshot injuries. The post-mortem report had suggested it was a direct hit at close range and not a rebounding hit as claimed by Behari Lal, he saidPost-mortem report suggested that it was a case of direct hitat close range.
