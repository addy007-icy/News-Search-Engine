The Adivasi season of religiousness and piety, currently on in Adilabad district, also brings to the fore many of the minute aspects related with their social mores, such as the manner in which children are brought up.There may hardly be anything new in the way in which this happens, but the Gonds and Kolams have retained old traditions when it comes to ‘grooming’ children within the limitations of their poverty.Not many Adivasis prefer sending their children to school before they are six years old.This helps the children grow up in close proximity of their immediate family a bit longer and in imbibing what can be termed as the family’s best traditions.“Adivasi children are admitted to schools rather belatedly, age wise. This gives them time to understand at least some of the intricacies of their culture,” agrees Kala Ratna award winner and founder of Kala Ashram at Adilabad, Guruji Ravinder Sharma.“This is also the reason for the Adivasi children, especially the Gonds, being highly creative,” Guruji, who was art and craft teacher at the Kolam Ashram school in Adilabad, says.“Playing in the village confines gives them an opportunity to learn social discipline,” he adds.“It will be interesting to study as to how Adivasi children grow up to be more disciplined and obedient compared with their counterparts,” suggests Atram Maruti, a Gond leader from Jainoor mandal."Giving respect to elders in the family and community comes naturally to our children," he reveals of one of the most important behavioural aspects of Adivasi children as he points out towards a group of disciplined boys and girls headed towards the Jangubai cave temple in Kerameri mandal.After birth, the Gond and Kolam children grow up with their parents and grandparents until they are sent to school. While they learn cultural discipline thanks to the latter, they understand the intricacies of work culture in the company of their parents.“In contrast to a normal urban child, a Gond boy or girl does not wait for a command to do some chore or any work for that matter at home or elsewhere,” the Kala Ashram founder says of the work ethics among the Adivasis.“This nature develops in an individual under the love and care shown by elders in the family,” adds Maruti.Children learn culture and discipline from grandparents and work culture from their parents
