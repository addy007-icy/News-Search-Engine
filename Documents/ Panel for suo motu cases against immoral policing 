Taking note of “immoral policing or goondaism” in Dakshina Kannada district, the Legislative Committee on Women and Child Safety will recommend to the government to direct the police to book suo motu cases in all such incidents.According to committee chairman V.S. Ugrappa, this will send a strong message to others to not resort to such practices. Speaking to presspersons after a meeting of the committee here, he said that Dakshina Kannada district was known for such incidents. He wondered how some groups in the district could take the law into their hands over matters relating to boys and girls being together.“If the police let such persons go scot-free on the pretext that victims have not filed complaints, the incidents would only increase,” he said.Earlier at the meeting, Mr. Ugrappa said that the committee would also recommend to the government to amend the Goonda Act to incorporate a provision for booking the accused of such incidents under the Act. But Police Commissioner of Mangaluru Chandra Sekhar M. and Superintendent of Police, Dakshina Kannada, Sharanappa S.D. told the committee that there was no need for amendment as cases could be booked under the Act. They said that the police were now booking the accused under the same Act and such incidents have come down.Mr. Ugrappa said he would examine it.
