All they wanted to know was why charge-memos had been issued to 650 doctors in the government service.A delegation of 20-odd doctors, led by AP Government Doctors’ Association convenor Vijayakumar Babu, co-convenors — Babji Shyamkumar, T.M. Reddy, and P. Shyam Sundar — were in for a “rude shock” when they went to meet Principal Secretary for Health, Medicine, and Family Welfare Poonam Malakondaiah in Hyderabad on Tuesday.Not only did the official refuse to entertain them in anyway but also declined to accept the bouquet of flowers the delegation tried to give her.“We were only being polite. We thought that it would be nice if we took a bouquet of flowers instead of going empty handed,” said one of the doctors to The Hindu on Wednesday.As per the service norms, government doctors should first be served a memo and asked for an explanation. But in the case of the 650 doctors in the State, charge-memos had been issued directly. The doctors were charged with working in nursing homes and private hospitals flouting service rules.“We have not been given a chance to explain our stand,” the doctors said.The delegation was even hurt when Ms. Malakondaiah allegedly asked them why they had come in such a big number.“We went to the neighbouring State (Telangana) to share our woes with her, and she compared us with sheep. We swallowed our pride to go to Telangana only to be insulted,” said one of the doctors.
