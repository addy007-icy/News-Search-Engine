In yet another pilgrim-friendly move, the TTD has resolved to dispense with the issue of ‘arjitha seva’ tickets under the current booking system from February 1.Tickets for all the sevas performed inside the temple on a daily basis, including weekly rituals, are sold to devotees across bank counters a day in advance under the current booking system.While tickets of the sevas like Brahmotsavams, Vasantotsavams, Dolotsavams, and Sahasra Deepalankaram are sold under the current booking system, tickets pertaining to Suprabhatam, Thomala, Archana, Abhishekam, Mel Chat Vastram, Thiruppavada, and Sahasra Kalasabhishekam, which have great demand, are made available to the devotees by way of electronic-dip system.As per the new plan, all the tickets presently available under the current booking system will be made available online for the benefit of the pilgrims from February 1.Talking to The Hindu , TTD Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao on Wednesday said the intention was to ensure transparency in the issue of the much sought-after seva tickets.“Devotees spend their nights in queue lines at the bank counter in anticipation of obtaining darshan tickets. The availability of tickets online will relieve them of this trouble,” he said.While 75 per cent of the tickets available under the current booking system would be diverted to the online quota, the remaining tickets would be put under the discretionary quota of the officials.The management is also toying with the idea of making the tickets under the discretionary quota available at its e-darshan counters spread across the country and at post offices.“The interests of the devout are paramount,” Dr. Rao added. He, however, clarified that the tickets had already been included in the bulk quota of 54,007 tickets the management released online for the month of February.
