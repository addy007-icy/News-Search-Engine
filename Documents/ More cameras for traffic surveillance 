As over 52 cameras installed at various locations in the city have either become defunct due to lack of maintenance, the city police have issued an annual maintenance contract of cameras to a public sector undertaking.All these cameras are linked to the Traffic Automation Centre that functions from the office of the Police Commissioner here. The real-time images from the cameras installed at traffic junctions and other important points here are accessed at the centre, which is manned by a group of policemen and technical persons. Police here claim that they slap fines on those committing traffic offences based on the footages accessed from the cameras that are in working condition. In its bid to strengthen traffic management, the police have proposed to install more surveillance cameras under the Mysore Traffic Improvement Project (M-TRAC), a project on streamlining traffic management. M-TRAC is on the lines of Bengaluruâ€™s B-TRAC. About 32 new high-resolution cameras have been proposed to be installed here.Also, the Traffic Automation Centre will be shifted to the new Police Commissioner Office building, which is under construction. An entire wall of the spacious centre will have a large digital screen, which will display live images retrieved from the cameras, a source said. The government had announced M-TRAC, a five-year project, two years ago. The role of M-TRAC is to develop strategies to ensure effective traffic management. Mysuru is the second city in the State after Bengaluru to be identified to integrate the elements of urban transport and improve commuter convenience.
