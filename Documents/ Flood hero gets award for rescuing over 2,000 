The State government has honoured 26-year old S. Mohammad Yunus for his “selfless, noble and brave act” of rescuing nearly 2,100 people during the recent floods that devastated Chennai.“If you had met me a few months back, you would have been shocked. I used to work like a money-making machine. I was never a social person. The floods taught me a great lesson. It was an eye-opener for me,” he said after receiving the ‘Anna Medal for Gallantry’ from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at the 67{+t}{+h}Republic Day celebrations.Now, he wants to teach politics and reform the youth. “I’m developing an app with focus on entrepreneurship, reforms and politics. It will be up ready and operational in three months. This will be similar to social networking apps,” Mr. Yunus said.
