Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will undergo 10 days of naturopathy treatment at Jindal Naturecure Institute from Thursday. Sources in Jindal told The Hindu that Mr. Kejriwal would reach the city at 2.15 p.m. with his wife and head straight to the institute. A team of doctors will decide on the course of treatment after tests. Mr. Kejriwal, who has diabetes, had taken naturopathy treatment at the institute in the past. He had undergone a 10-day course along with parents soon after the Delhi elections last March.
