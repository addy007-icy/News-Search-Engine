The rupee appreciated 10 paise to 67.53 against the dollar at the Interbank Foreign Exchange in early trade on Monday on increased selling of the US currency by banks and exporters.Forex dealers said that apart from increased selling of the American unit by exporters and banks, dollar’s weakness against other currencies overseas supported the domestic currency.A higher opening in domestic stock markets also helped the rupee strengthen against the dollar, they added.The rupee had recovered from its 29-month lows by rising 39 paise to close at 67.63 in Friday’s trade on fresh selling of dollars on the back of recovery in equities.
