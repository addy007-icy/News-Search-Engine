Revathi may have walked out of prison along with her nine-month-old child, but she was far from happy. Her husband Amburaj, who has spent about 18 years in jail, will continue to serve out his sentence.Revathi, who met Amburaj while performing in a play in Bengaluru, married him when they were both out on parole.The People’s Legal Forum convener Baburaj said Amburaj’s release on good conduct had been shot down by the State government as he was serving term for having connections with forest bandit Veerappan.“I will meet Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and request him to consider Amburaj’s case on compassionate grounds,” said Ms. Revathi.Speaking to The Hindu from Amburaj’s native Puthukad in Erode, Revathi said her husband’s aged parents were also looking forward to his release, but were happy to see their grandchild.Baburaj said Revathi was a victim of trafficking.
