n December 9, 2013, a 40-year-old convict serving a life sentence died at Rajan Babu TB Hospital (North Delhi). The immediate cause of death was recorded as respiratory failure coupled with medical complication brought on by tuberculosis.There was nothing abnormal about the death and it was on its way to becoming a mere statistic, but all that changed when the body was handed over to the parents.Om Prakash Tomar, father of the deceased convict Raj Kumar, noticed that his son’s right eye was missing and there were bite marks on the ear lobes. “There was an empty eye socket on the right-side of the skull and clear indication of damage to his ears,” recalls Mr. Tomar. His eyes fill-up even three years on as he remembers the moment he saw his son’s mutilated body.The hospital and police authorities told the parents that rats in the hospital’s mortuary — where the body was kept for less than 10 hours — could have gnawed through.“The death of our son fast turned into rage at the sheer disregard for a dead body shown by the hospital and police authorities. We were handed over a mutilated, disfigured, rat-eaten body of our son. How can a parent deal with this?” asks Tomar, a retired DDA class-IV employee. “We went to court demanding justice.”During the case, the hospital admitted lapse while the court maintained that the case was not about loss of life “but invokes the situation of dignity of the dead body, which was a joint responsibility of the hospital and jail authorities.”“Rs. 10 lakh was awarded as compensation,” recalls advocate R.P. Luthra, who represented the family.The case exposed the callousness toward dead bodies in government hospitals and sheer lack of respect for the safety of the living involved in handling (post mortem/viscera collection/ storage) the bodies.The Delhi High Court’s intervention in the matter exposed the sad and ugly truth of mortuaries in the government hospitals of Delhi.Subsequently, hospital administrations were forced to admit that bodies were rotting in morgues, outdated and rusted tools were being used for autopsies and that mortuary employees were exposed to various infections.The High Court has since initiated public interest litigation on its own in the matter and passed a slew of directions to the Delhi government to improve the situation. The court’s intervention, while prompting the government to pay compensation to Raj Kumar’s family, also looked at the larger issues of compliance with the standard operating procedure, standing order on disposal of unclaimed bodies and submission of report of magisterial inquiry into the convict’s death and missing eye from his body are pending before a Division Bench of the High Court.On its part, the Delhi government has assured the court that the up-gradation of mortuaries will be carried out in the next six months.The exercise will involve inspection of mortuaries, assessment of equipment required, preparing and approving estimates and completion of tender formalities. The Delhi government has also appointed a nodal officer to coordinate between the Tihar Jail hospital and referral hospitals.Amicus Curiae in the matter, Advocate Saqib says: “Much needs to be done to ensure the dignity of the dead. Though the hospitals have been asked to shape up; the speed at which it should be done is not happening.”He adds that the nine government mortuaries in Delhi are paralysed due to acute staff shortage, non-availability of space and storage material and poor upkeep of the infrastructure.“In these mortuaries even the living are shown scant respect. They remain exposed to infections. They don’t get regular medical check-ups or take adequate preventive measures for communicable diseases that are compulsory for those handling dead bodies.Hospital authorities on condition of anonymity maintain that they are doing the best they can under the available manpower, space and resources. “We are stretched beyond our capacity”.His right eye was missing and there were bite marks on his ear lobes.
