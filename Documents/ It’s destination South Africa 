Imagine a holiday where you get to see the wildlife at close quarters while driving your car, or from a hot air balloon, or even by foot! Then enjoy surfing on the high seas , rappelling by the rapids, bungee jumping, longest wine route…even better able to shop gold and diamonds!!All this is possible if you travel to South Africa. Although there are no direct flights from here to any of the cities there, apparently many tourists from the twin cities have been flying to destinations there via the Middle East, in droves from among the 85,000-odd from all over the country and increasing 20 per cent annually.Is it any wonder that as many as 50 top travel exhibitors from South Africa landed up here on Thursday to showcase their country’s natural beauty at its 13{+t}{+h}annual road show to increase ‘destination awareness’ among the travel planners in India.“We have segmented packages for India and made it even more local, suiting different cities like Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata for families, honeymooners and others. Everyone speaks English and Indian food is available everywhere even vegan as well as Jain food. You can even try out the South African-Indian food,” said Hanneli Slabber, country manager, South African Tourism, based in Mumbai.Packages start from one lakh per person onwards but she promises amazing adventure tourism and Indians could make use of the lean tourist season from April to June when temperature hovers around 18 degree Celsius what with the currency exchange rate being Rs.1 – Rs.4. “We are also promising visas within a week from here,” she said.“Although we have high tourist inflows from United States and Europe, India is a major long haul market for us,” said Monica Luel, general manager, international marketing, South African Tourism.David Frost of the South African travel agents pointed out that there were also 400 inland tour operators so that varied needs of any traveller could be customised. The road show was kicked off at Kolkata, followed by Delhi and will now move to Mumbai from here.
