A school kid with an entrepreneurial zeal might not be taken seriously by parents, but the Telangana government wants to consider him/her an asset. Schools in the State will soon have a system in place where students who come up with innovative ideas or exhibit entrepreneurial skills will be awarded with course credits. The plan was mooted by IT and Panchayat Raj Minister K.T. Rama Rao on Monday, who felt that such an academic initiative was necessary to foster growth of startups and also bring a change in society’s mindset.“After Intelligence Quotient and Emotional Quotient, it is now the turn of Cultural Quotient,” felt the minister. “After students complete their tenth standard, parents in our country want their children to take up maths or biology and science. It is too early for children to take a decision and if they want to take a detour in the middle of their course like becoming an entrepreneur, then it is not accepted.”Mr. Rao said that the course credits system will give merit to the thoughts of the schoolchildren to take forward their ideas and interest in the field of entrepreneurship.The IT Minister also informed that the much-awaited Telangana IT policy will be unveiled in the second week of February.A MoU was signed between the Telangana government and NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Services Companies) to start a warehouse at T-Hub. This will be the fourth such NASSCOM warehouse in the country where an area of about 2,500 Sft and about 40 seats at T-Hub will be used to create a micro-ecosystem for startups selected across the country as part of its 10k Startup programme. The selection committee of the programme has already received around 40 applications and the chosen startups will be given a time of four to six months to graduate from T-Hub.Telangana IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said that they were also exploring the possibility of having a T-Hub outpost in places like Silicon Valley to give startups and entrepreneurs an opportunity to perform at a global level.B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, chairman, NASSCOM said that the success of startups have to be celebrated and entrepreneurship should be popularised so that there is a positive outlook towards the industry.An MoU has been signed to build a warehouse atT-Hub which will be used to create a micro-ecosystem for startups
