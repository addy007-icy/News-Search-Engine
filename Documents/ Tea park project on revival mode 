The Cochin Tea Trade Association has decided to revive the tea park project which has been on the backburner for almost three years.Sources said the association was on the lookout for a suitable piece of land either on Willingdon Island or outside the port premises for the tea park, which would basically be a warehousing facility, centralising all operations related to tea trade. Storage, blending and other activities related to export-import business could be housed in the proposed tea park.Executive director of Tea Board C. Paulrasu, who was recently in Kochi, told The Hindu that the board would extend support to the project though the board did not make any financial commitment on its part. However, he said, the Tea Trade Association could explore the possibility of getting financial help from the Union Ministry of Commerce. The Association had been pursuing the project since 2013.Tea Trade Association sources said the association had sent a memorandum to the Tea Board seeking its help for reviving the project. The renewed interest in the tea park project comes in the wake of the establishment of a facility in Mettupalayam. Called the Coonoor Tea Trade Centre, the facility has come up on 13 acres.Port landTea Trade Association sources said the traders were not vacating port land but exploring feasible options if land is available outside the port premises. At present, the bulk of the tea business in Kochi is concentrated on port land. The Cochin Port Trust has drawn up a comprehensive plan for optimising land use. The port authority has 192 acres of vacant land and port users who can assure minimum throughput is being offered the land on lease up to 30 years.
