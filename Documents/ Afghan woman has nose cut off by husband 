A young woman in a remote northern region of Afghanistan had her nose cut off by her husband, officials in the region said on Tuesday.Fawzia Salimi, a hospital director in Maymana, capital of Faryab province, said 22-year-old Reza Gul was brought in early Monday having lost a great deal of blood.Ms. Gul’s husband, 25-year-old Mohammad Khan, has since fled their village.Ms. Salimi said the Afghan-Turk Hospital in Maymana was trying to arrange transport for Ms. Gul to Turkey for further treatment.Domestic violence rife hereDomestic violence is widespread in Afghanistan, where women are often denied constitutional rights designed to protect them.Violence has also become somewhat entrenched in Afghan society after 40 years of war, with nearly non-existent mental health care and few options or outlets for a traumatised population.“It’s not just in Faryab, it is across the entire north of the country [due to] poverty, high unemployment, ignorance about marriage,” he said.Among the poorest regionsFaryab borders Turkmenistan and is among the poorest regions of Afghanistan, with many people relying on government food handouts. Corruption is also rife, with many residents complaining that officials pilfer the aid.Over the past year, the Taliban’s presence in the region has grown. The militant group has intensified its campaign following the drawdown of the international combat mission in 2014.
