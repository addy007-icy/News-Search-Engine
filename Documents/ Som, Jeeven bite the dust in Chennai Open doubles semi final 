Indian wild card pair of Somdev Devarman and Jeevan Nedunchezhian went down fighting to experienced duo of American Austin Krajicek and French Benoit Paire in straight sets of 7-5, 7-6(4) in 90 minutes in the doubles semi final of the Aircel ATP Tour tennis tournament held here tonight.The rivals traded breaks after Somdev was broken in the very first game of the match but breaking back Krajicek in fourth and then in 8th, the Indians went on to lead but it was short-lived as the hosts were broken twice - Som (9th) and Jeevan (11) â€” with Krajicek holding on to his serve in the 12th game for the set.In the second set, Paire and Krajicek were in their elements but the Indians were equal to the task and never relented in their counter attacks. Somdev was broken in the 5th game but they managed to break Krajicek, who seemed to be a weak link in rallies.In the tie break, the Indians led 4-3 by winning four points on the trot but then when Paire took charge in his service game, it was too hard for the Indians to match their rivals. Paire earned four points from 3-4 to 7-4 and to win the tie break and match.Paire and Krajicek will take on Oliver Marach (Aut) and Fabbrice Martin (Fra) in the finals today evening.
