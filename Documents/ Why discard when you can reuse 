If you have a tear in your favourite shirt or a camera that refuses to capture images, get them to this café. The Bengaluru-based India chapter of Repair Café, a concept already popular in a few European countries, the U.S. and Australia, is all set to host its second workshop in the city on February 27. The aim is to encourage people to give repairable items another chance instead of discarding them.Purna Sarkar and Antara Mitra, who started the India chapter of Repair Café in Bengaluru two months ago, quit their previous jobs after discovering a shared passion for repair . They made their debut last November with a workshop in Bengaluru. While there are pockets in the city (SP Road, New Thippasandra, Commercial Street, K.R. Market and Malleswaram) where repair shops thrive, they are limited mostly to the old city areas, and are seeing a drop in customers, Ms. Mitra, a graphic designer, said. That is because people believe in the use-and-discard model rather than scouting for repair shops, she added.“This is true for items for which you cannot find spare parts. Household medical equipment such as weighing scale is an example,” Ms. Sarkar, who left her career in HR to start Repair Café, said. The workshop aims at bringing together under one roof professional repairers and tinkers (volunteers who know and like to repair items).Where and when?February 27: Daily Dump, 12th Main, IndiranagarMarch 19: The Green Path, MalleswaramJune 5: HSR Layout
