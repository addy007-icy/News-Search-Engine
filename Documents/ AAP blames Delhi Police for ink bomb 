: The ink attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal last week has given the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) a fresh chance to slam the Delhi Police, this time over what it calls a “conspiracy” to weaken Mr. Kejriwal’s security.The CM, along with members of his Cabinet, were on the stage during an event on January 17 to mark the end of the odd-even experiment when a woman tried to throw ink at him. The incident highlighted not only the security lapses, but also the Delhi Police’s failure to act, according to the AAP.Speaking at a presser on Saturday, AAP leader Ashutosh said it was clear that the Delhi Police had failed to protect the CM and was trying to cover up its incompetence. While giving bail to the attacker, Bhavna Arora, a Delhi court observed o Friday that if the CM was unsafe then what would be the situation for common citizens.“The court’s observations have vindicated our stance that there is a larger conspiracy to weaken the CM’s security. Last Sunday’s incident was not just a security lapse. This has happened before as well,” said Mr. Ashutosh.He said when Mr. Kejriwal was returning from a visit to Ludhiana earlier this month there were no police personnel with him, despite the fact that he has ‘Z’ plus security cover.“This is happening in connivance with the Centre. The Delhi Police and the Home Ministry should tell the public if they have acted against those responsible for the lapses,” said Mr. Ashutosh.Targeting Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi, the AAP said it challenged the top cop to react publicly to the observations by the court. The AAP said, in a statement, that the sessions court had made it clear that the ink attack was a security lapse and that the Delhi Police had not learned from previous incidents.
