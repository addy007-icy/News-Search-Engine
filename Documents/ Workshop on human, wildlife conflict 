: A two-day workshop, being organised by the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, for mediapersons in the district on the 'Role and Influence of Media in mitigating human wildlife conflict in Wayanad' began at the Gaja Auditorium of the Forest Department at Sulthan Bathery on Saturday.Addressing the workshop, Pramod G Krishnan,Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife, Palakkad) said animal attacks and animal crop raids were not new issues to the villagers living on the fringes of forest. But, of late, there has been a tendency to sensationalise the incidents among a section of media . Such sensational reports would create fear psychosis among the public, instead of pacifying the rural people. .Hence an in-depth analysis on the issue was the need of the hour instead hyping such issues.Media should keep neutrality while reporting forest-related issues like the Judiciary ,he added. â€” Staff Reporter
