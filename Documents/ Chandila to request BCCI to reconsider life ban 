Banned Rajasthan Royals off-spinner Ajit Chandila claimed innocence and said on Tuesday that he will request the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to reconsider its decision.The former Rajasthan Royals player was on Monday banned for life by BCCI for his role in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. Chandila, who was arrested by the police for spot-fixing during IPL matches in 2013, was “held guilty of misconduct and corruption” under various articles of the BCCI Anti Corruption Code”.“I am devastated by the ruling. But I have hope. I will request BCCI to reconsider the decision. I will wait for its response. I have hope they will reconsider the decision,” he told reporters at a press conference.“I am innocent. Cricket is like a religion to me. I never thought such a verdict will come and I will request BCCI to re-think.”BCCI suspended Chandila in May 2013 after his arrest by Delhi Police. He was granted bail in September 2014 by a Delhi Court.He said that he was not thinking of challenging BCCI’s decision and filing a lawsuit.“I am not planning to challenge the decision in the court. I want to request the BCCI to reconsider their decision. The BCCI has different set of rules and the court has different set of rules,” he said.He also refused to apologise or show remorse publicly.“Neither me nor my family can express their sorrow in public. I cannot just show my emotions in public. And there is no point of pleading before anyone.”
