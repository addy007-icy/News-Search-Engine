A freedom fighter, and kin and legal heirs of freedom fighters attended the Republic day celebrations organised by the district administration after they obtained assurances from officials that they would be treated with dignity and respect.“We opted to attend the function only at the last minute as the initial decision taken a fortnight ago was to stay away from the function to protest the repeated neglects and disrespect shown by the authorities when it came to treating the freedom fighters, their kin and legal heirs during many functions held over the recent years,” said P. R. Natarajan, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Freedom Fighters and Legal Heirs Samithi. But not all went smoothly on the day even though the officials were seen showing courtesy while honouring them unlike on the previous occasions.S. Somasundaram, a 95-year-old freedom fighter who took part in the Quit India Movement, had to come on his own from Kanakkampalayam, where he stays with his daughter, to the Chikkanna Government Arts College grounds where the R-day celebrations been held, and had to go back alone. “We pointed out to the officials that they should have arranged the vehicle to pick up Mr. Somasundaram, who is the only freedom fighter in the function with others been either heirs or kin,” said Mr. Natarajan.
