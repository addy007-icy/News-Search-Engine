The police have booked cases against the former Minister M.P. Renukacharya and 41 farmers from Davangere district for allegedly blocking the National Highway 206 on the city outskirts on Wednesday, demanding release of water from Bhadra reservoir for cultivation of summer crops in the command area.Owing to low water-level in the reservoir this year owing to scant rainfall, the Bhadra Command Area Development Authority (CADA) had announced that water would be released for standing crops like arecanut, coconut and sugarcane during summer for 84 days. The CADA had directed the farmers in the command area not to take up cultivation of food crops, including paddy, millets and pulses, this summer.The farmers, led by Mr. Renukacharya, staged a protest in front of the CADA office on National Highway 206 on the city outskirts on Wednesday demanding that water be released for food crops also. The protesters blocked the highway for more than four hours causing inconvenience to people. When police personnel asked the farmers to withdraw their protest, a verbal clash ensued between them. According to sources, the protesters had not obtained permission from the authorities for blocking the highway. The police booked cases under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 184 (preventing public servants from discharging duty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 504 (provoking breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code against Mr. Renukacharya and 41 protesting farmers.
