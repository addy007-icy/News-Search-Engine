The farmers of Nunna village, about 20 km away from the city, have appealed to CRDA Commissioner N. Srikanth that the proposed Inner Ring Road (IRR) should be re-aligned in a way that it does not pass through their village. The villagers said the new IRR was redundant as it was at just half a kilometre from the existing IRR and 1.5 kilometres from old outer ring / bypass road. While the proposed IRR is marked at 6 km in other areas such as Ibrahimpatnam and Gollapudi, it is only 1.5 km from the high density area of Ramavarappadu Ring.
