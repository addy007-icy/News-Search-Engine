He would threaten to register cases against them and force them to shell out money, Mr. Lokesh Kumar said.On December 19, Raghu and Govindaraju confronted Varun Umesh (27), a city-based software engineer, and his female friend on NICE road. The accused took the couple in their car to an ATM near Talaghattapura police station and forced them to withdraw Rs. 60,000. Sensing something amiss, Varun approached the police and filed a complaint.The Talaghattapura police formed a team and zeroed in on Raghu based on his previous criminal record. Raghu confessed to the crime and said that he had robbed at least six more people on NICE Road. “We have approached a few victims … but they refused to file a complaint fearing social stigma,” Mr. Lokesh Kumar said. The police have recovered Rs. 52,000, a car and the police uniform used by the accused to commit the robberies. Raghu was recently arrested by the Rajarajeshwari Nagar police in a mugging case. However, he came out on bail in seven days, Mr. Lokesh Kumar added.
