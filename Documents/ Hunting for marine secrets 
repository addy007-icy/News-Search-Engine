The sea is much more than what one sees from the shore.Underneath the rolling and heaving waves is a world that one forgets exists — a world as vibrant and colourful, diverse, and threatened as what lies above.On the seabed, plants such as marine algae and sea grass provide sanctuary to creatures such as sea sponge, corals, ascidians, sea whips, and Gorgonian fans.These creatures are born among the sea plants to avoid predators, find their food there, and die there, their lifecycles sustaining life on earth in no small measure.Plumbing the depths of the sea for a fascinating glimpse of the myriad life forms there is ‘Kadalarivum Camerayum’, an exhibition of photographs and video to be organised by the Friends of Marine Life at Museum auditorium from January 21. Former Additional Chief Secretary D. Babu Paul will inaugurate the exhibition at 11 a.m. that day.To be held in association with the Kerala Union of Working Journalists Thiruvananthapuram district committee, the exhibition will aim at revealing to the people the landscape under the sea and the wondrous world there, and the need to conserve them. It will showcase 100 photographs and 15 minutes of video shot over 12 days of underwater photography in select ecologically sensitive areas in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, and Kanyakumari districts.The photographs have been taken over two years by the scuba diving team of the Friends of Marine Life at depths of up to 43 metres.Robert Panipilla, coordinator, Friends of Marine Life, says the exhibition will highlight the need for resource mapping of 590 km of the State’s coastline, at least to a depth of 10 metres, to be followed up by marine biodiversity assessment.This, he says, will prove crucial when infrastructure projects are taken up, for a thorough assessment will help in protecting these ecosystems without confusion over the environmental impact of the projects.The exhibition will be on till January 24.An exhibition of photographs and video will begin at Museum auditorium on January 21.
