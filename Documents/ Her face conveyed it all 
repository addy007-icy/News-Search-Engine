A later inclusion in this year’s Music Academy Festival due to a last-minute dropout, Sreelatha Vinod, performing in the second half of the second day, won-over the by-then depleted audience, with the persuasive power of her expressional dance.Following a leisurely ‘taritajham’ entry in the Pushpanjali followed by the Thirupalliezhuchi ‘Pallaandu, Pallaandu’ set to a talamalika in Gambhiranattai, was the Swati Tirunal padavarnam in Kalyani ‘Saami unnaye naan migavum nambinene’. Structured in the traditional varnam format, it portrayed the nayika addressing her love plaint to Lord Padmanabha, entreating that he respond to her cry, not feigning indifference at this moment. While the jatis composed by Venkatakrishnan Mahalingam, who provided the nattuvangam lead, had the necessary nritta tautness, the dancer’s own expression through abstract movement in the strictest codes of technical correctness, was unexceptionable — with the interpretative aspect standing out for its quality. Urging that the moment is ripe for Padmanabha to saveher from the pangs of unrequited love, the nayika makes a subtle visual comparison succinctly showing how the Lord’s prompt arrival, in response to the distressed calls of Draupadi and Gajendra, had saved them. Through minimal movement, the epithets addressing the Lord such as ‘Kamalanabhadeva’, ‘Gambheera’, ‘Prananatha’ were evocatively conveyed.Wisely, for the purely abhinaya segment, the dancer settled for two very well-tried compositions, which, pickled in centuries of cultural memory, evoked rare vibes in the audience. ‘Mogudochi Pilachedu’ announced correctly as the contribution of unknown authorship (though listed in the brochure as a Kshetrayya padam), saw the dancer at her best in portraying the mixed emotions of the nayika bidding farewell to her beloved playmate Krishna, for the husband she waswed to in her childhood, has now come to take her home, to start conjugal life. “Do not forget me, for like the Lotus which with the distant Sun’s rays blooms, though far away, my thoughts will be of you,” she says. The next padam, a staple, was Oothukkadu Venkatakavi’s ‘Thaye Yashoda’, revolved around the Gopis’ complaint to Yashoda, in a baffled mix of annoyance, amazement, love and reverence, about Krishna’s antics, wondering at this boy/adult/ who is none other than ‘Vasudeva Himself’. Sreelatha’s interpretation was movingly incisive, without exaggeration.
