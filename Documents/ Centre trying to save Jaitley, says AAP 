The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday claimed that the Centre was trying to “save” Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley by declaring as illegal the Commission of Inquiry to probe the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).After the Delhi government ordered an inquiry into the alleged scam the “Centre has been trying to ensure Jaitley’s ‘role’ during his tenure as head of the cricket body was not exposed,” the party said in a statement.The Centre had declared the Commission “unconstitutional and illegal” as Delhi is not a ‘full-state’. The AAP government had, in December last year, appointed former Solicitor General Gopal Subramanium to probe alleged irregularities in the DDCA. The Commission of Inquiry was set up following a resolution passed by the Delhi Assembly.“The letter sent by the Centre to the Delhi government is a sort of love letter which we have got used to,” said AAP leader Ashutosh. “It has been proved that the Modi government has no intention to probe any irregularities in DDCA and that the Centre’s move is legally and politically wrong.”Referring to a communication from the Home Ministry in August, he said, “In the CNG fitness scam too we had set up an inquiry commission. The court did not quash it. It said that the government should not resort to coercive measures, but it did not quash the inquiry panel. The Centre’s move makes it clear that they do not have any respect for judiciary.”The AAP has accused Mr. Jaitley of wrongdoings during his tenure as the DDCA chief between 1999-2013. In response, the Union Finance Minister had rubbished these allegations and filed a criminal and civil defamation cases in a city court against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders. But despite a letter from the Centre, the Delhi government has said that they will go ahead with the Commission of Inquiry.Centre had said the AAP’s commission of probe into the DDCA scam was unconstitutional
