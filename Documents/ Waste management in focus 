‘My City, Beautiful City,’ the city Corporation’s ambitious waste management programme, has been floundering over the past few months with waste piling up even in wards, which were declared ‘clean’.The new leadership of the local body is now planning to revive the programme.The first step towards this is to make the new councillors aware of the programme and its components. A workshop for all the 100 councillors is being planned for later this month. The Corporation’s current plan is to install at least two aerobic bins in each ward.Most of the aero bins are now concentrated in wards around the centre of the city. The peripheral wards, especially in the coastal areas, have remained outside the programme’s radar till now.“Another plan is to promote the use of kitchen bins. Already, there are many takers for it,” says K. Sreekumar, the Health Standing Committee Chairperson.A kitchen bin works as a miniature form of the existing pipe compost units but uses coir pith (chakiri) mixed with inoculum for composting. The bin, with holes on all sides, can be placed in the kitchen, and biodegradable waste can be dumped in this mixed with the coir pith-inoculum mix.The pipe compost units, which was one of the focus points of the waste management programme aiming at treatment of waste at source, have fallen into disuse at most households in which it was installed.Training squadsThough there have been some efforts at reviving the units by sending training squads to households, this has not found much success till now.The ‘My City, Beautiful City,’ which was working fine in the initial stages under the leadership of T.M. Thomas Isaac, MLA, has lost focus in recent months, especially prior to the local body elections.Failure in sustaining that initial momentum has resulted in waste piling up even in wards with aerobic bins, biogas plants, and waste collections units.Though there has been a sustained campaign to drive home this message, through advertisement campaigns even in theatres in the city, it has not made the desired impact among the public.The squads, which were sent for patrolling in different wards during night time to catch waste dumpers, have also ceased functioning.The Corporation authorities are gearing up to revive the programme, before the successes of the initial days are lost amid the piling garbage.New councillors to be made aware of the programmePlan is to install two aerobic bins in each ward
