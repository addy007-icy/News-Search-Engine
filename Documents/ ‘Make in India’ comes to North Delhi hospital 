The Centre’s ‘Make in India’ initiative could come to the Capital soon, with a municipal hospital in North Delhi being considered for manufacturing of medical devices.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Rajan Babu Tuberculosis Hospital in Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar has seen the number of patients dip from about 700 to 200, making large parts of the premises unused. “The private ward, auditorium and land totalling 20 acre are not being used all that much. The Health Ministry is looking at using the hospital’s space to set up a facility to make medical devices,” said North body Standing Committee chairperson Mohan Bhardwaj.Speaking at a committee meeting on Saturday to present the 2016-2017 budget, Mr. Bhardwaj said the civic body could earn over Rs.100 crore by renting out the hospital’s buildings. The North body has been struggling to make ends meet for a year now, forcing it to look at leasing out property.
