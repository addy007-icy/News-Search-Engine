Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has termed the steep hike in the price of LPG cylinders as a move by the Central government to allow monopoly forces to profit.Coming as it does, immediately after the government had withdrawn the subsidy on LPG cylinders, it represents a heavy blow for the common man, he said in a pressnote issued here. “Despite the cratering price of crude oil in the international market, the government has not only failed to bring down the price of petroleum products, it has instead decided to hike prices. The State government, on its part, has tried to profit from the situation by levying additional tax on the hike.”— Special Correspondent
