Bharatanatyam dancer Bhavna Kumaran chose a Muthuthandavar kriti ‘Eesanaey, Koti Surya Prakasaney’ for her opening item that gave her an opportunity to depict Siva in various forms. She launched her nava rasa varnam next, in Tamil, ‘Angayarkanni Anandam Kondale’ by Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. While depicting the several forms of goddess Meenakshi from a valiant warrior-woman to a peaceful Mother, Bhavna had ample scope to exhibit her abhinaya skill. Especially for the lines ‘Alakala vishathai’, as well as, ‘Santhaswarupini Meenakshi’ Bhavna was quick in changing her moods. The nattuvangam for the recital was by her guru and mother Sowmya Kumaran, whose jathis were absorbing. The dancer should ponder over whether such a speed in the portrayal of the goddess in the concluding jathis is necessary. This spoils the overall beauty of the sober piece.Dancers never seem to tire of performing ‘Krishna Nee Beganey Baro’ and Bhavna is no exception. Admiring the little Krishna’s pranks, admonishing the divine child for eating mud and standing awe-struck on seeing the universe in His tiny mouth are not unusual portrayals. Bhavna could have chosen a different padam, instead.Vidwan Balamuralikrishna’s tillana in raga Brindavani served as the penultimate item of the performance. She followed it up with the popular Sanskrit sloka ‘Maithreem Bhajatha,’ to conclude her recital.This U.S. based dancer was accompanied by G.R. Pradeep (vocal support), M.S. Sukhi (mridangam), Selvaprasad (violin) and Sujit Nayak (flute).
