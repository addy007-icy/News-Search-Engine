The Krishna district Congress party’s Kapu Cell programme was marred by sloganeering by the late Congress leader Vangaveeti Mohan Ranga’s supporter, who found fault with the organisers for not placing Mr. Ranga’s portrait on stage. They raised slogans and interrupted Mr. Reddy’s speech. Despite senior leaders trying to pacify the supporters, they did not relent. The situation came under control only after Mr. Reddy instructed the organisers to place the portrait. He said the Congress party would always remember Mr. Ranga’s service to the party and in particular to the Kapus.“It was only by mistake that organisers had failed to place his photograph, and it was not intentional,” he said.
