Very minimal impact of the odd-even rule was visible on its introductory day at the Delhi High Court on Friday, an official holiday on account of New Year. No judge came to the Court as there was no hearing scheduled for the day.With winter vacations coming to an end, only skeletal staff was present on the Court premises to take care of security and cleanliness. A few lawyers turned up in their cars to attend to work in their chambers, while the support staff used two-wheelers or public transport to reach the Court.Advocate-on-Record T.L. Garg told The Hindu that he travelled to his office on the Court premises by taxi.“On my way from Hauz Khas to Sher Shah Road, I only saw very less traffic on the road. I guess about 10 per cent among the motorists were violating the odd-even rule.”In another indication of the rule being violated, some cars with even number licence plates were spotted in the High Court’s parking lot.Mr. Garg said the fact that such cars were able to enter the high-security Court campus showed that enforcement of the rule was not stringent.Interestingly, the Delhi Government embarked upon the plan to restrict the number of vehicles on city roads on the basis of their registration numbers after a Division Bench of the High Court pulled up the authorities for their lack of action to curb air pollution and observed that living in the Capital was like “living in a gas chamber”.With a large number of persons challenging the formulation and implementation of the scheme and also seeking exemption, the High Court is at present seized of the matter.While the court has refused to exempt professionals including lawyers from the rule, it will decide in due course whether the scheme should be invalidated on the grounds of lack of broad-based consultations and absence of scientific studies on its impact on air pollution.Some cars with even number licence plates were spotted in the High Court’s parking lot
