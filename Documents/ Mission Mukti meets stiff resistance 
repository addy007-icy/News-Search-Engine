An immunisation campaign launched jointly by the Health Department and the district administration in Valavannur grama panchayat in the district met with stiff resistance on Thursday.Although 97 children below five years of age and 124 children below 16years of age were given immunization during the campaign, the resistance the medical teams faced in some pockets of the grama panchayat was the worst in the district.“What do you lose if one or two of my children die,” an elderly woman asked the medical team, giving them one of the rudest shocks from the field. Another woman said her family knew what to do if something happened to their child because of being unimmunized.“We are not interested in allopathy,” she said.However, the medical team led by District Medical Officer V. Ummer Farook, Reproductive and Child Health Officer R. Renuka, and several paediatricians from the government service did their best to convince the people. And they succeeded in some cases too.A woman who resisted the vaccination by quoting the Paediatrics Head of Government Medical College, Manjeri, became defenceless when Mohandas Nair appeared in front of her. “I am Dr. Mohandas. I have never advised anyone against vaccination,” he said. The woman had no answer. The immunisation programme, titled Mission Mukti, marked the launch of a district-wide campaign.Valavannur has the largest concentration of unimmunized children in the district. The medical teams diverted in nine groups and reached out in the 19wards of the panchayat.Indian Academy of Paediatrics district president D. Joshi, District TB Officer Shibu Lal, and several doctors from Government Medical College, Manjeri, and MES Medical College, Perinthalmanna, and volunteers of several organisations were part of the campaign.
