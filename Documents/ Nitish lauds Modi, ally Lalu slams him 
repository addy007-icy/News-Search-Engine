Bihar’s coalition partners spoke in different voices on India’s ties with Pakistan on Friday with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar lauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Pakistan, while alliance partner and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad slammed Mr. Modi, citing the Pathankot terrorist attack to say the country was not safe under him.It was, perhaps, for the first time that Mr. Kumar has publicly praised an initiative by Mr. Modi, given the political bitterness between the two.“What I personally believe is that Modi’s visit to Pakistan was right. It was an admirable initiative to normalise bilateral ties,” Mr. Kumar told mediapersons on Friday.However, just an hour later RJD chief Lalu Prasad slammed Mr. Modi. “What happened to Mr. Modi’s 56-inch chest which he earlier used to brag about? How did the terrorists enter our airbase? The BJP and the PM must explain,” said Mr. Prasad here.
