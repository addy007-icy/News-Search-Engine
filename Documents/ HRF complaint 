A team from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) led by M.T. Karuppiah, Deputy Director, MoEFCC, Regional Office, Chennai, inspected the project site for the proposed 4X270 MW Bhadradri thermal power project in Manuguru mandal on Saturday.The inspection by the MoEFCC team follows a complaint filed by the Human Rights Forum (HRF) against the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TSGENCO) charging it with going ahead with the construction of the project without the mandatory prior environmental clearances.The HRF also approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking an order to the project proponent to stop the alleged unauthorised construction works for the project in Manuguru citing lack of “Environmental Clearance” in December last year.
