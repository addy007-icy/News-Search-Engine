Hashim Amla was 200 not out on an idyllic batting pitch as South Africa continued its long fight-back against England in the second test on Tuesday, reaching 428-3 at lunch on the fourth day.South Africa dragged itself to 201 runs behind England’s huge first innings of 629-6 declared, with the top-ranked Proteas’ revival inspired by a significant return to form from captain Amla.Amla made his fourth double century in tests and put on an unbroken stand of 160 with Faf du Plessis, who was 81 not out. That followed Amla’s partnership of 183 with AB de Villiers on the second day.The pitch at Newlands was perfect to bat on, with just four wickets falling in three days in Cape Town. A total of 1,057 runs have been scored in two innings so far, and South Africa has lost just one wicket in four sessions.England leads the four-match series 1-0. A draw at Newlands, which appears increasingly likely, would set up decisive tests in Johannesburg and Centurion.The England bowlers’ battles to get anything from the pitch were not helped by the tourists’ poor catching.Amla had been dropped twice in his innings, De Villiers was also dropped, and England then missed a chance off Du Plessis on Tuesday when he was on 61.Off-spinner Moeen Ali forced an edge, and James Anderson missed the catch at slip, with the ball flying past him. It was Anderson’s second miss of the test in that position.Amla also survived a nervous moment when on 197, looping a mis-timed shot in the air toward mid-on. The ball fell safely between two England fielders, who appeared confused over who should go for it.Straight after, Amla took a quick single to mid-on to go to 200 just before lunch.
