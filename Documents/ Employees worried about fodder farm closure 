Around 40 employees working in the fodder grass farm run by the Dairy Development Department at Valiathura are a concerned lot these days as they believe a concerted move is being made to close down the farm.The farm caters to the fodder needs of around 200 marginal dairy farmers residing in and around the city. The department had been running a fodder farm at Valiathura on 129 acres taken on long-term lease from the government, of which 40 acres were released for the modern sewage treatment plant in 2012. The government promised to provide 40 acres to the department to continue with the farming activity. However, only 25 acres was given to the department, said an employee of the farm.“Now, the government is planning to take away the farm land for rehabilitation of people evicted during development of the airport and fishermen. Revenue officials visited the farm and informed us about the government decision,” he said.Considering the availability of fresh fodder, the department for long was nurturing a plan to construct a model farm to provide fresh milk to the city residents. The move to close down the farm will affect the livelihood of around 40 employees and dairy farmers will be deprived of fresh fodder.
