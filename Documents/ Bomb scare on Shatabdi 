A bomb scare sent security agencies in Delhi and Ghaziabad in a tizzy early on Sunday, leading to evacuation and search of a Lucknow-bound Shatabdi train and heightened security at the New Delhi railway station.The measures were taken after the Delhi Police received information about a bomb being planted on a Kanpur-bound train from the Mumbai Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS), which had received a threat letter.The Lucknow Shatabdi, which crosses Kanpur on its way from Delhi, had left the New Delhi railway station at 6.10 a.m. on Sunday and the Government Railway Police (GRP) received information about the bomb threat from the Delhi Police at 6.30 a.m. “The train had reached the Ghaziabad railway station by that time and was immediately stopped there. At 6.48 a.m, all passengers were evacuated from the train and a search was conducted by the local police and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel,” Neeraj Sharma, Chief Public Relations Officer, Northern Railways told The Hindu .A sniffer dog squad was also pressed into service and bomb disposal squad was called at the spot too. At 7.40 a.m. the security agencies gave their clearance following a thorough combing operation of the train.“After getting the clearance, the train resumed its journey at 7.52 a.m.,” Mr. Sharma said.The train was checked thoroughly once again after it reached its destination.Coming just a day after the terror attack at an Indian Air Force base at Pathankot, the information received from the Mumbai ATS was taken very seriously, Mr. Sharma said.At least two more Kanpur-bound trains were also checked at the New Delhi railway station, which has been put on high alert and has witnessed stringent security measures since Sunday morning.Apart from trains, all passengers are also being frisked at the station and snigger dog squads have been deployed, apart from augmentation of RPF personnel.Already facing delays due to the fog season, many trains were running late on Sunday due to the bomb scare.On December 26, 2015, passengers of the New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani also had to face a harrowing time after the train was stopped at the Sahibabad railway station and checked for nearly two and a half hours due to a bomb threat, which later turned out to be a hoax.Following the Pathankot attack on Saturday and also preparations for Republic Day on January 26, Delhi is already on a high alert with security enhanced at all vital installations including the Indira Gandhi International Airport and major railway stations.The Lucknow Shatabdi had left Delhiand reached Ghaziabad
