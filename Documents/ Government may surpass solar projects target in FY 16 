The government is confident of receiving bids for 3,000 MW of solar projects this financial year against the set target of 2,000 MW. “This financial year, that is up to March 31, we have to commission 2,000 MW of solar projects and we will actually do 3,000 MW. Next year onward, the target is 12,000 MW, 15,000 MW and 17,000 MW for each subsequent year,” said Tarun Kapoor, Join Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, while speaking at the Roadmap to a Low Carbon Economy conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.Solar tariff fell to a historic low of Rs.4.34 per kilowatt hour following the auction of a 70 MW project in Rajasthan, with the winning bid going to Finnish solar power company Fortum Energy on Tuesday.“The good thing is that the price has fallen drastically. But the purpose of the government is not to drive down prices to unsustainable levels. The purpose is to achieve volumes,” Mr. Kapoor said. While there is a lot of demand for larger solar projects and solar water-pump projects, there has not been much progress on the ground regarding the rooftop solar projects, he added.
