The Bombay High Court said on Monday that the government had failed to act on 50 cases of noise pollution that the state itself had recorded.A Division Bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice CV Bhadang was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Thane resident Mahesh Bedekar, who raised concerns over blatant violation of noise pollution rules and norms during festivals.An affidavit filed by an officer of the state government gave details of noise pollution levels in the state during Navratri and Diwali festivals last year. The affidavit stated there were 50 cases of violation of noise pollution rules that were recorded and that there was not a single case of breach of noise pollution rules in Nashik, Aurangabad, Pune, Nagpur, Solapur and New Mumbai.The court said the State cannot make a tall claim that there was no violation of noise pollution rules. The court said rules had been laid down for music levels during religious festivals, processions and at religious places time and again and hardly any action had been taken by officers against offenders of noise rules.The bench remarked that noise levels have to be maintained throughout the year even during New Year celebrations and not just during religious festivals. The court said criminal law had to be set in motion against offenders and prompt action had to be taken by officers.It was brought to the notice of the court that the state has 494 meters to check noise decibels and there is a requirement of 2,295 such meters. The court then directed the state to grant approval to get new meters, make arrangements for maintenance, and procure the same in three months.The court further directed the state to allow people to upload their complaints regarding any breach of noise pollution rules on the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board website.The court also suggested that the website should also take up anonymous complaints and the action-taken report too must be uploaded on it.The court further directed the state to consider launching mobile apps for citizens to lodge their complaints and provide wide publicity to make people aware.It adjourned the matter to January 18.
