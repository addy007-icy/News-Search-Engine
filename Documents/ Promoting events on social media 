A participant at the Coimbatore Shopping Festival who had taken part in several exhibitions in the city in the last few years, decided to send out text messages to all his old customers in the city about his stall.Thanks to different platforms available online and on the mobile phone, retailers, manufacturers of consumer goods and participants and organisers of exhibitions are able to reach out to a large number of customers. Most of exhibitions now also have Facebook page and video clippings of the previous editions to attract the crowds.Manju P. Pillai, Postmaster General, Western Region, says there is a marginal impact of technology on the volume of advertisement materials, invites and pamphlets that are sent by post. However, the business processing centre at the head post office continues to receive invites and pamphlets in bulk.“I think there is more credibility when people read about events in print. Hence, organisers who send out invites or share information on social media also count on a printed invite or flyer,” she says.Also, she points out, printed material is still the way to reach out to customers in rural areas who may not use social media so extensively. So sending printed material through post is here to stay for a while longer.Reporting byM. Soundariya Preetha
