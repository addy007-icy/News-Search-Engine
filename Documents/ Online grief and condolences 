If the first few hours after the death of research scholar Rohith Vemula on Sunday triggered online grief and condolences, on Tuesday it became a divisive issue with sharp political divide. Known twitter handles of trolls and baiters got active targeting their opponents. Dredged up to make their cases were old videos, conflicting caste certificates whether Rohith was a Mala (SC) or a Vaddera (OBC), chronology of the events leading to the suspension, and even older FB posts of the 25-year-old man who ended his life.But away from political posturing, the student community honoured Rohit with the best way they can: A change of display picture (DP in Internet parlance). Thousands of students changed their DP showing either the smiling face of the bearded Rohit Vemula or his words from the five-page suicide note.Students and activists could not restrain themselves as they agonised about the traumatic turn of events. Some waxed poetic: “ Eklavya hum sharminda hai, Dronacharya aaj tak zinda hai ” while others just stuck to “Rohith Vemula Amar Rahey”.And for a brief while, Rohith Vemula had his moment of glory when #RohitVemula became the top trend in the country ahead of even #twitterdown.
