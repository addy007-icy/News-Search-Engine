President Pranab Mukherjee did the right thing in calling for clarifications from the Home Ministry on the Centre’s recommendation to impose President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh (“Pranab seeks clarification on Arunachal” and “Decision draws flak from experts”, both Jan.26). Beginning with the dismissal of the Communist government of Kerala in 1959 despite its majority, it was the Congress party that was the first to blatantly and shamelessly use the ambiguous phrase “failure of constitutional machinery” to settle scores with political opponents. It is amusing now to read about the Congress crying foul (“Blatant bid to topple duly elected govt., says Rahul”, Jan.26). Now that the coin has flipped, the BJP, no saint, is adopting the same practice. It is clear that whichever government is in power will continue to use the office of the Governor and the CBI to its advantage and to try and silence the Opposition.B. Harish,MangaluruPresident Mukherjee rightly chose to tread a cautious line. It is apparent that the Centre’s recommendations have ingenuity written all over them for there is nothing in Arunachal Pradesh to suggest that there is a breakdown of administrative machinery or a constitutional crisis. The Congress too has a valid reason in crying foul. Will it now take the legal route to stop the BJP in its tracks?N.J. Ravi Chander,Bengaluru
