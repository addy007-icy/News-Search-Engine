Differences cropped up after parents alleged that the organisers allowed latecomers to perform first in the competition while bypassing those who were waiting from morning at the Kala auditorium venue. The judges decided to leave the venue without completing the evaluation process in view of the protests by parents. The competition began after the organisers and police personnel intervened to resolve the issue.
