A class 10 student from Erode, Tamil Nadu, has come up with a device that helps in harvesting tapioca tubers easily without using electricity.Pavithra R., a student of SRC Memorial Matric Higher Secondary School, Punjai Puliampatti, Erode, who has developed farm-friendly implements, has many awards, including four national awards, to her credit.Ms. Pavithra, who recently received the Ignite Award–2015 from President Pranab Mukherjee, demonstrated her machine for harvesting tapioca tubers at the Children’s Science Congress, being held as part of the 103rd Indian Science Congress here.Tapioca is one of the major horticultural corps in Erode. The easy-to-carry two-wheeled machine, which can be dismantled, helps in harvesting tubers besides removing unwanted plants, she said.“The stem of the plant has to be kept in between the two jaws of the machine. After the other end of the iron rod connected to the machine is pressed, the jaws lift the plant with its roots. There is no need to use a crowbar or a shovel,” she said.Ms. Pavithra, who has so far developed a plant plucker, weed remover, manuring tool, and a walker-cum-chair, said the machine costs Rs. 1,000 and could be made from easily available materials locally.She had met the former President late A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in Ahmedabad in 2014.
