Traders affiliated to Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peravai observed a fast here on Friday in support of various demands, including revival of jallikattu this year.The fast was organised with the theme that people should not give up their rights. In a resolution passed at the conclusion of the fast, which was led by K. Rajapandian, president of the Madurai district unit, the Peravai wanted the government to declare jallikattu, a symbol of Tamil culture, a sport of valour. The sport, which had been banned by the Supreme Court, should be conducted this year, it said.Another resolution called for making Tamil the language of the Madras High Court. The Peravai also urged the Union government to come out of the World Trade Organisation. Since the formation of the WTO, Indian agriculture, trade, small industry, banking, insurance and telecom sectors had been affected to a large extent. The government introduced value added tax, service tax and online trading only at the behest of rich nations, which conspired to plunder developing nations through the WTO, it said. Those who addressed the participants included T. Vellaiyan, founder of the Peravai.
