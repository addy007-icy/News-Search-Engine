The traffic police and the Exhibition Society have managed to keep parking around the exhibition grounds free of cost, and the parking mafia at bay. Visitors to Numaish have to content with parking on the main road where free parking was originally only planned for two wheelers.The usual parking space in the many buildings around the exhibition went out of bounds as parking agents refused to toe the police’s dictum to fix rates.The free parking space on the road is cordoned off, with volunteers and the cops keeping a watch on the vehicles in addition to maintaining order. “The contractors refused to fix a price in many buildings as desired by the police. When that did not happen, the buildings were closed. We are allowing parking of 100 cars under the Metro Rail,” Goshamahal Traffic Inspector Srinivas said.Parking of vehicles around Numaish is often blamed for traffic slowdown in Nampally and Old City during the 45-day expo.This time, the traffic police has taken over the parking space that GHMC usually auctions and is enforcing order with 30 volunteers from the Exhibition Society.
