Government Lady Goschen Hospital, the busiest maternity hospital in Dakshina Kannada that has been struggling for space for treating its patients, is likely to get some relief in March when part of its 275-bed new block will be opened.It was in 2011 that part of this 163-year-old hospital was brought down to facilitate construction of the new block at a cost of Rs. 21 crore.Despite nearly six years, the construction of the new five-storey block was yet to be completed. The building was being constructed by the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited as a part of their corporate social responsibility programme.Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim, who heads the committee overlooking the affairs of the Hospital, told The Hindu on Sunday that a local contractor from the district has been assigned the task of completing the construction.The work of nearly Rs. 9 crore was pending. Service of the Bengaluru-based contractor, who has been accused of delay in construction, has not been continued since December 31, he said.Mr. Ibrahim said the local contractor has assured of completing the ground and the first floor of the new block by March. The remaining part of the construction was likely to be completed by the end of monsoon, he said.Gynaecologist Savitha, who is the in-charge Superintendent of Hospital, said if the work on the ground and first floor of the new block is over by March they will be moving patients from the congested old block. This will also help in taking up construction of 60-bed maternity and child health (MCH) wing of the hospital at a cost of Rs. 10.46 crore under the National Rural Health Mission.Health Minister U.T. Khader on Friday told reporters that he had asked his department to blacklist the Bengaluru-based construction firm that had delayed construction of the new block of Lady Goschen Hospital.
