A road accident, in which a farmer was killed on Saturday near Seegalli village, triggered a marathon discussion on the absence of threshing yards and farmers using State highways and district roads to thresh their harvests.It may be recalled here that Chikkaharave Gowda had spread out his harvests on the road and had slept by the side to protect his crops. He had covered himself with stacks. The driver of a truck, in a bid to avoid driving over the harvest, veered to the side of the road and ran over the farmer.
