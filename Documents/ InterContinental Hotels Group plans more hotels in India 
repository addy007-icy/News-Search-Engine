The new plan includes opening 51 hotels with 10,000 rooms.Talking to The Hindu, IHG Head of South West Asia, Shanta de Silva said that IHG follows asset light model and focus was on managing the properties rather than investing on it. Currently, the new projects were in different stages of development-design, planning and construction.Elaborating about the expansion plan, he said during the current year, IHG would open four hotels that included three in India and one in Bangladesh. Within the next 10-15 years, the idea was to have at least 150 hotels in India.In Chennai, IGH has three properties. It operates Adyar Gate Hotels under Crowne Plaza brand, Holiday Inn Express at Mahindra World City and IGH resort at Mamallapuram.“With the opening of Holiday Inn at Tidel Park, Chennai will become the first city in the country to have all the four brands,” he said.Arindam Kunar, IHG Area General Manager South, said: “We are operating 25 hotels under four brands in India – two InterContinental Hotels, 10 Crowne Plaza, 10 Holiday Inn and three Holiday Inn Express hotels. India is an important market for IHG and it is ranked next only to the U.S. and China and hence focus is on opening more hotels.”“Within a year, plans are to open two more hotels in Chennai – Holiday Inn at IT Expressway and Holiday Inn Express on OMR. With the opening of these hotels, we will be managing over 850 rooms in and around Chennai and would be hitting the 1,000-rooms mark soon,” said Vijai Singh, IGH General Manager.
