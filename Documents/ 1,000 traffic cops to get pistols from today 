: Traffic policemen in the Capital will no longer be easy targets in case of a terror attack or physically aggressive traffic violators.From Tuesday, 1,000 traffic cops out in the field, particularly in vulnerable zones, will be armed with pistols, announced Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi on Monday.“The move will allow us to have armed men out on the roads, across the city and around the clock. That way we will have a good number of weapons ready to be used in any emergency situation,” said Mr. Bassi. Muktesh Chander, Special CP (Traffic), told The Hindu that 600 pistols have already been handed out to cops and the rest will be armed before Tuesday.“The armed cops will be of the rank of head constable and above. They will carry Glock 19 mm pistols,” said Mr. Chander.As a policy, until now traffic cops have never been armed while on duty despite frequently being engaged in heated conversations with disgruntled traffic violators.Incidents of road rage and other violence, in which traffic cops were the targets, have been frequently witnessed. Traffic personnel are often run over by speeding motorists when asked to stop.“There have been instances when traffic cops have been abducted by traffic violators or have been viciously attacked. That will not happen anymore,” said Mr. Chander.Mr. Bassi also reiterated the effectiveness of helicopters in managing the city’s traffic and said their use will be more frequent in the coming months.Plans are also afoot to add 1,500 PCR vans, taking the total to 2,500, said Mr. Bassi. The increase should take place by the end of this year or the start of 2017.
