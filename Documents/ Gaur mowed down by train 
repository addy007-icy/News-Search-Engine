A fresh incident of a gaur being mowed down by a train near Londa of Khanapur taluk on Hospet-Tinaighat section in close proximity with the Bhimgad Wild Life Sanctuary in Belagavi forest division was reported on Wednesday.The death of the wild animal comes close on the heels of deaths of an elephant calf and a gaur in railway accidents on the same railway section in the last four months.Wildlife activist Giridhar Kulkarni, who has been keeping track on wildlife deaths in railways and road accidents in this area since long, has urged the Forest Department to take action against the Railways for not heeding its repeated requests for due mitigation measures in these areas.The failure to take mitigation measures was only increasing wildlife mortalities. He said that since 2011 six gaurs and an elephant calf had fallen prey to trains on this railway line.
