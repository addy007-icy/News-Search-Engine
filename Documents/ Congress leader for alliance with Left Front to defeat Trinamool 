Highlighting the need for an electoral alliance between the Congress and the Left Front in the 2016 Assembly polls a senior Congress leader from West Bengal has written a letter to the Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice- president Rahul Gandhi.Omprakash Mishra, general secretary of the State Congress who is also member of All India Congress Committee (AICC) in the letter claims that if such and understanding is arrived at then it would overthrow Trinamool Congress (TMC) government and “usher in Congress- Left Front government in West Bengal”.With his letter the Congress leader has attached a document containing vote and seat projection for the proposed Assembly polls in 2016 where the Congress and Left Front are winning more seats than the TMC.Referring to the results of 2014 Lok Sabha polls Mr. Mishra says that TMC emerged as most successful party winning 34 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats with a vote share of 39 per cent where as the Left parties secured 30 per cent and Congress 10 per cent votes.The Congress leader who is also a professor of International Relations at Jadavpur University also predicts that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for whom 2014 was a high point will see a drop in 17 per cent votes achieved which will side with the Left parties and Congress combine giving it a definite edge over ruling party.Mr. Mishra said that he has discussed the issue with the State Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and AICC observer to West Bengal C. P. Joshi.TMC ridicules talks of allianceMeanwhile, TMC secretary general Partha Chaterjee said that grassroots Congress workers would not accept the alliance with Left and support Mamata Banerjee instead. He also pointed out that the CPI (M) had not followed jyotdharma (rule of alliance) in the past.“If you see its CPI (M)’s political character, you will find that it never observed jotdharma (rule of alliance). Sometimes it gives support to Congress and withdraws it at some point of time. Only in Bengal it has some smaller parties in the Left Front and it has ruled with highhandedness.” Mr. Chaterjee pointed out.TMC had a vote share of 39 % where as the Left parties secured 30 % and the Congress 10 % votes in the Lok Sabha polls
