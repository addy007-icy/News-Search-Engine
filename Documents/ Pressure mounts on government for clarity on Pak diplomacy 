Diplomats consulted by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told The Hindu on Monday, that two back to back attacks in Pathankot and in Mazar E Sharif has made it imperative for the government to clarify its position on the peace initiative on Pakistan.Two of the senior diplomats who attended the meeting with Ms Swaraj told The Hindu that the government can save the dialogue process only by reaching out to the public in a manner of consultation, as otherwise it will find it difficult to justify Foreign Secretary-level talks for mid-January following the terror strike on Pathankot.“The Prime Minister is a great communicator. He can reach out and explain why peace with Pakistan is in the interest of India and South Asia. That is the only way to stop the growing sentiment against speaking to Pakistan, following the attack on Pathankot and Mazar E Sharif,” Satyabrata Pal, one of the former High Commissioners to Pakistan who were consulted by Sushma Swaraj on Sunday evening, told The Hindu.Mr. Pal told The Hindu that the government should avoid responding to the attacks by cancelling talks in one swift counter-move.“A big part of Pakistan wishes to benefit from the economic success of India. The trade lobby of Pakistan is eager for dialogue with Indiak, the civilian government is committed to dialogue as it won 2013 election of Pakistan promising to work for peace with India,” Mr Pal said elaborating that India will have to protect the dialogue process as it is in India’s interest.The consultation of Sunday was thought up in the backdrop of the speculation that the Foreign Secretary-level talks might get postponed due to the attack which continued for the third day on Monday.
