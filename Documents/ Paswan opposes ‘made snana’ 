Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Food and Consumer Affairs, has condemned the practice of ‘made snana’.Addressing a press conference at Devarayanadurga on the outskirts of Tumakuru on Sunday, he said, “I condemn it [made snana] or any discrimination against Dalits.” Mr. Paswan said that as it came under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, a case could be filed against the authorities. He underlined the need for a constitutional amendment for the effective implementation of reservation for the SCs and STs. Mr. Paswan said that though reservation had been guaranteed by the Constitution, it was not being implemented properly even after 69 years of Independence. Mr. Paswan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union government had nothing to do with issues such as the Ram Temple or the uniform civil code. The government’s only agenda was development, he said.
