The “Three Chariot Festival” or “Trirathotsava” was celebrated on Car Street here on Thursday.The exponent of Dwaita philosophy, Sri Madhwacharya, had installed the idol of Lord Sri Krishna at the temple in Udupi on “Makara Sankranti,” about 800 years ago. It is to celebrate this installation that the “Saptotsava” is held. The “Three Chariot Festival” on Thursday and the “Churnotsava” on Friday are part of this “Saptotsava”.The “utsava murtis” (idols taken out during procession) of Lord Krishna and Lord Mukhyaprana (Hanuman) were brought in a golden palanquin to the “Madhwa Sarovara” pond on the premises of Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple at around 7.20 p.m.These idols were then shifted to a decorated boat, which went around a “mantapa” in the pond thrice amidst chanting of “mantras.” This is called “Teppotsava.”Then, the idol of Lord Krishna was taken from the pond and placed on the biggest chariot called “Brahmaratha” in front of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple. The idol of Lord Mukhyaprana was placed in the chariot called “Garuda Ratha.”Then the “utsava murtis” or idols of Lord Ananteshwara and Lord Chandramouleshwara were placed in the chariot called the “Mahapuja Ratha.” These chariots were then pulled by the devotees around the Car Street.The Three Chariot Festival was held under the supervision of Vidyavallabha Tirtha Swami of Paryaya Kaniyur Mutt.Vishwapriya Tirtha Swami of Admar Mutt, Vidyasagar Tirtha Swami of Krishnapur Mutt, Vidyadheesha Tirtha of Palimar Mutt, Vishwavallabha Tirtha of Sode Mutt, Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami of Shiroor Mutt, Sugunendra Tirtha Swami of Puttige Mutt, Vishwaprasanna Tirtha, junior seer of Pejawar Mutt, were present.The Churnotsava or Suvarnotsava, to mark the culmination of Saptotsava, will be held at Car Street here at 9.30 a.m. on Friday.
