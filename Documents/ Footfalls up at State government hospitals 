The State Government insistence on its employees to make use of public hospitals for out-patient check-ups and other related services has led to a windfall to them.In the last two months alone, the government hospitals have seen footfalls of over one lakh patients across Telangana with Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) alone treating more than 6,000 patients so far.The government has also disbursed up to Rs.114 crore till date for the check-ups at both government and private hospitals (accepting Aarogysri packages).“We have set up separate kiosks and desks at all public hospitals including Gandhi, Osmania and other area hospitals elsewhere to guide government employees,” informs Dr. M. Chandrasheker, Chief Executive Officer, Arogyasri Health Care Trust.Under the new Employees Health Scheme (EHS), the government intends to provide cashless treatment to all its employees and pensioners along with the dependent family members through a network of empanelled hospitals of the Arogyasri Health Care Trust.This was to be done through the issuance of health cards and as a replacement to the ongoing medical reimbursement system where employees have to first pay and then claim bills.“It was common knowledge that the reimbursement scheme was being misused, therefore, the government wants to keep a check on unwarranted payments. Our package system is definitely more fool proof,” asserts the CEO. Incidentally, one of the reasons for the rush to the public hospitals is because of the ‘reluctance’ on the part of the dozen odd super-speciality hospitals to accept the cashless card facility without any “assurance” of hikes on the available package rates from the government.Talks with super-speciality hospitalsTalks between the super-speciality hospitals and the health officials are currently deadlocked on the prices of the healthcare packages as decided by the Arogysri Trust. The issue was to be decided at the Chief Minister level but twice the meetings got cancelled and in the meantime, the election code – first Warangal, and now GHMC, has come into effect, explain officials.However, Arogyasri Trust officials indicate that many other National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare and non-NABH accreditated hospitals have been accepting the health cards issued to nearly 90 per cent of the State Government employees, their dependents and pensioners.“We are already paying two per cent more than our packaged rate for NABH hospitals and they are doing a good job,” insists Dr. Chandrasekhar. Even as it tries to firm up the cashless scheme through EHS, the government has also announced extension of the reimbursement scheme up to June this year.
