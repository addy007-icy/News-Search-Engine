The Central Library of Kannur University is still to be full-fledged because of the undue delay in completing the work on the five-storey building constructed on the university’s Thavakkara campus.The library building was originally scheduled to be completed by January 2013. The delay has been attributed to snags on the part of the Chennai-based contractor company.The work was then rescheduled to be completed by the end of the financial year 2014-15. The university authorities now say that the work can be completed by the end of February.The library was shifted from a rented facility to the new building even as the work was in progress.Full-fledged facilities not yetThe full-fledged facilities envisaged in the Rs.25-crore library project are still to materialise because of the delay in its commissioning.Civil works of the library building are nearly complete and the only major work that remains is the installation of the lift, said university Vice-Chancellor M.K. Abdul Khader. The agency that has been contracted to do the lift work assured that it would be completed in a month, he said.“Our plan is to develop the library into a facility available even to the public,” Dr. Khader added.The full-fledged library with an area of 1,20,000 sq ft will have a seminar hall with 400 seats, a heritage museum and art exhibition facility and a digital library.Though the university has earmarked Rs.50 lakh for local area network (LAN) including work for laying optical fibre cable, the authorities are now planning to install Wi-Fi facilities on each floor at an estimated cost of Rs.10 lakh.According to sources, the library has nearly 40,000 books. The research scholars, numbering over 100, are facing difficulties for want of facilities.Though the working time of the library is 12 hours starting from 8 a.m., it has been reduced to seven hours starting from 10 a.m. The working hours have been cut short in view of the safety of research scholars using the library facility as the work is still going on.
