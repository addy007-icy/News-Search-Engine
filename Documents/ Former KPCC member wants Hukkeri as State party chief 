The former Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee member Shankar Munoli has urged Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi to appoint former Minister Prakash B. Hukkeri, MP, as president of the KPCC to check the imbalance in sharing organisational powers in the State unit of the party.Poll performanceAs the incumbent G. Parameshwara had been appointed Home Minister, the elevation of Mr. Hukkeri would ensure representation to Lingayats, a dominant caste in north Karnataka which had been marginalised within the State Congress unit, he said.Mr. Munoli said the partyâ€™s performance in the polls to Legislative Council from the local bodies constituency in Belagavi was not up to mark.
