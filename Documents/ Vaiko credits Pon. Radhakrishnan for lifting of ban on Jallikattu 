The credit to the lifting of ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu should go to Union Minister and BJP MP Pon. Radhakrishnan, said Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko here on Friday.Speaking on the sidelines of the party’s regional conference here, Mr.Vaiko said the entire credit should go the BJP leader from the State, who according to him, was instrumental in persuading the Centre in lifting of the ban. “While the Centre has been callous towards Tamil sentiments on several issues, the NDA had heeded to popular sentiments on Jallikattu,” Mr.Vaiko, said thanking the Central government. In the same vein, Mr.Vaiko snatched the thunder off the hands of the AIADMK-led State government, stating that the Tamil Nadu government did not act with zest to push for the lifting of the ban. “The UPA had issued the ban based on misconceptions about the sport,” the MDMK leader said.On the continuing ambiguity on the Makkal Nala Kootani’s leadership, Mr.Vaiko said the decision on a CM candidate, would be decided post-elections, by the elected MLAs of the alliance. “This was the practice followed traditionally, to elect the Chief Minister after the elections in a democratic manner,” said Mr.Vaiko, in presumed veiled reference to the PMK’s projection of Anbumani Ramadoss as the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate. The goal of Makkal Nala Kootani is to ensure the defeat of both AIADMK and the DMK in the State Assembly elections and provide a credible alternative, the MDMK leader said. The MDMK’s regional conference was held here for four districts of Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Thiruvannamalai.
