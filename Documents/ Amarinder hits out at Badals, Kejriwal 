Launching a scathing attack on the Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh on Thursdayy said the Badals were concerned only about their family at the cost of people of the State and dubbed Arvind Kejriwal as a “liar” who only does “dramas”.Addressing a gathering at the political conference of his party on the occasion of Maghi mela here, Capt. Singh lambasted the Badals for “destroying Punjab completely”.“People of Punjab, especially the youth, are dejected due to bad policies and programmes of SAD government,” he said.If voted to power, the Congress would rid Punjab of Badals and also ensure equitable development of the entire State, he further said.“Badal (Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh) and ‘Chhota’ (referring to Sukhbir Singh Badal) are only concerned about their family and never think of the poor in the State,” he said.Farmers are committing suicides, youth is dejected and the industrial sector is in a poor shape under the present regime, he alleged.“Only Badal family has grown richer in Punjab, while the entire state has become poorer,” he claimed.Taking a dig at Mr. Badal, Capt. Singh said .”the Akali government failed to introduce policies and programmes for the benefit of youth, farmers, industries and traders.“Instead of opening avenues for jobs, Badal government closed two big industrial units set up during the Congress regime at Abohar and Hoshiarpur,” he said claiming that the Congress in its rule had waived off the debt of farmers.Opening a frontal attack on AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Capt. Singh said: “This man wears a ‘topi’ (cap) and projects himself as an honest person, whereas he is a liar.” Mr. Kejriwal is an “outsider”, he said. Questioning AAP’s expenditure on the posters of Mr. Kejriwal, put up across the State, he said the Congress wanted to know from where he got so much money.-PTI
