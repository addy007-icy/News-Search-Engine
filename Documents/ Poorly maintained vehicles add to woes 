TNSTC officials say that the rule is that a bus has to be replaced on completion of six years on the road or on covering seven lakh kilometres. But, that is not happening due to shortage of funds. So, parts that need replacing regularly are not replaced, often because getting spares to replace faulty parts is becoming increasingly difficult as they are for buses that are more than a decade old. “We replace faulty spares with worn-out spares from a bus that is not on road. It does not last long,” a senior technical staff said. So it is always patchwork maintenance that is done.It is not uncommon to see black smoke billowing out of these buses, or buses stranded in the middle of the road. TNSTC officials claim amidst scepticism that their buses are checked twice a year and fitness certificates are issued once every six months (private buses get it once a year) Drivers struggle to drive their worn out vehicles. They are supposed to undergo an eye check up every six months. “When we turn 45-years-old we have to undergo annual full check up at the Government Medical College at Perundurai (Erode), but that is irregular and therefore does not serve the purpose,” a senior driver said.
