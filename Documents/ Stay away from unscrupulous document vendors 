I have a B1/B2 visa valid until 2017. I travelled to the U.S. in 2008 for work. In September 2015, my passport got damaged due to rain. I applied for a new passport and received it. I am planning to travel to the U.S. soon. Can I use my existing visa for the travel?Amrita BanerjeeAs long as your U.S. visa is not damaged, you may use it for travel to the U.S. port of entry, even if the visa is in your old, cancelled passport.You need not apply for a new visa unless your visa was also damaged by the rain.Please note, however, when travelling to the U.S., you will need to bring your new passport AND your old passport with the valid U.S. visa.If you donâ€™t want to carry two passports, or you believe your visa was also damaged by the rain, you should consider applying for a new U.S. visa through the Interview Waiver Program (IWP). Please see our web site for more information.On getting admission in a U.S. university, can a J2 visa be changed to an F1 visa?R.V.
