Star batsman Ajinkya Rahane split the webbing of his right hand while fielding during the fourth ODI against Australia, in Canberra on Wednesday.The batsman required four stitches on the webbing of his right hand and will only bat if the situation arises.It is highly likely that the Mumbai right-hander will be rested during the fifth ODI in Sydney on January 23.Normally, stitches are removed after a week, which can also put his participation in the subsequent three-match T20 International series in doubt.After an injured Rahane left the field, it was Manish Pandey, who came in as the substitute fielder for the remainder of the Australian innings.
