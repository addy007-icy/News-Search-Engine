The Odisha government should bring registration of construction workers and provision of benefits to them under the Odisha Right to Public Service Act, demanded Odisha Nirman Shramik Union (ONSU).The union, affiliated to the Trade Union Centre of India (TUCI), made this and other demands during a conference held in Berhampur on Thursday. The union members alleged that the Building & Other Construction Workers’ Board (OB&OCWB) had become a centre of corruption and irregularities.According to ONSU president Sibaram, 50 per cent of construction workers in Odisha were yet to be registered. “Ninety-five per cent of the registered construction workers were also not able to avail benefits they are entitled to,” he added.The union alleged that registration of a construction worker by labour department takes one to one-and-a-half year.Mr Sibaram also accused other unions of exploiting the workers. He alleged that a union had taken away major part of the compensation meant for the family of a dead construction worker in Bhubaneswar.To check the delay in registration and provision of benefits to eligible workers, the union demanded that all these activities be brought under the Odisha Right to Public Service Act. The union also wanted labour cards within 30 days of application and benefits in 45 days of application. They wanted pension for old construction workers to be increased to Rs.3,000 per month as they felt the current amount of Rs.500 per month was too meagre.The union also suggested filling up of all vacant posts in district labour offices as well as employment of more computer proficient staff for speedy online registration. The ONSU felt financial power of OB&OCWB can be increased by hiking the cess collected from construction firms from one per cent to two per cent.Labour cards within 30 days, benefits in 45 days of filing application: Nirman Shramik Union
