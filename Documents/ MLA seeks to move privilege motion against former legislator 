P. Rajiv, Kudachi MLA, has filed a notice before Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa seeking to move a privilege motion against former legislator S.B. Ghatge. In the notice, Mr. Rajiv has accused the former legislator of breaching his privileges as a legislator by trying to tarnish his [Rajivâ€™s] image through false allegations. He said Mr. Ghatge falsely alleged at a convention of Congress workers in Kudachi that he (Rajiv) had taken Rs. 1.6 crore from a sugar factory to curb protest by farmers against non-payment of dues by the factory.
