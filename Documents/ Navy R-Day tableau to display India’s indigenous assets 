The Navy tableau this Republic Day will display India’s first indigenously developed aircraft carrier Vikrant and submarine Kalvari.While Vikrant is under construction at the Kochi Shipyard in Kerala, the submarine, first of the Scorpene series, is under construction in Mumbai.The blueprint of the future Indian Navy is anchored firmly on indigenisation, with it engaging actively with Indian shipyards, both public and private, to progressively increase the indigenous content, so that future warships are 100 per cent ‘Made in India’.The Naval contingent of 144 young sailors would be led by Lt Cdr Anil Raina as the Contingent Commander and three women officers, Lt Manisha K Takshak, Lt Cdr Chetna Sonsale, and Lt Priyanka Chand as the Platoon Commanders.These young officers in the marching contingent had joined Indian Navy only in August 2015.Having just passed out from the Basic Training Establishment at INS Chilka, they exhibit the fine results of their five months of hard work in the Navy, a Navy official said.The renowned brass band of the Navy shall be led by Ramesh Chand, Master Chief Petty Officer (Musician)- First Class.The naval band will march on the Rajpath for the 18th time in succession.
