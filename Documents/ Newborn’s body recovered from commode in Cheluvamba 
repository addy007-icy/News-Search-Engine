Barely two months after recording a series of maternal deaths, Cheluvamba Hospital in Mysuru, is back in the news again with the recovery of a newborn girl child’s body from a commode in the hospital on Tuesday.When the cleaning staff of the hospital found the decomposed body in the commode of the toilet in the labour ward, they alerted the hospital management, who in turn brought it to the notice of the police.The hospital authorities went through the records of the hospital and informed the police that one Roopa from Nanjangud had delivered a still born baby girl on Monday and suspected that Roopa, who was still recovering in the hospital and her husband Murthy, may have dumped the baby in the toilet.When the police detained Murthy for questioning, he clarified that the still born baby girl that his wife gave birth, was buried the same day in his native Krishnapura village in Nanjangud taluk.But, the police continued to remain suspicious of Murthy. However, his relatives exhumed the still born girl’s body and brought it to the police station late on Tuesday.Though the police let off Murthy, the latter and his relatives staged a demonstration in front of Devaraja police station adjacent to Cheluvamba Hospital on Wednesday. They accused the hospital management of harassing them. Meanwhile, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Devaraja Sub-division) Girijesh said the investigation into the recovery of the newborn baby’s body is continuing. “We don’t know whether the baby was stillborn or it had died after it was born,” he told The Hindu.The recovered body has been sent to Mysore Medical College & Research Institute for a post mortem, he said.Meanwhile, Dr Krishnamurthy, Dean of Mysore Medical College & Research Institute, said the hospital authorities brought the matter to the notice of the police as a ‘procedural formality.’He further said that the hospital authorities were engaged in scanning the CCTV footage of people visiting the hospital to help identify the culprits.The hospital staff is going through 48 hours of video footage for clues.
