Even though there are more women per 1,000 men in Udupi district, the number has been declining in the last decade.Deputy Commissioner R. Vishal said the district has a high Human Development Index and is highly literate; and the present figure of 1,095 females per 1,000 males is the highest in the State. However, it is below that of the 2001 figure of 1,130 women for 1,000 men.Mr. Vishal was speaking after inaugurating a workshop on laws relating to women and children for district-level government officials, organized by the district administration here.In other districts, where the number of women is low, there are signs of improvement; and the skewing of sex ratio in a district like Udupi is a cause for concern.The administration is in talks with the Department of Community Medicine of Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, to study the reasons behind the drop in the number of women in the district. Officials said it was necessary to ascertain if this was due to the “One Child Policy” or if there was some other reason.Though violation of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act is being ruled out, officials said this angle might have to be looked into.Mr Vishal said that a committee headed by the chief executive officer of the zilla panchayat is in place to address issues related to sexual harassment in government offices.The administration will hold a camp to create awareness on the importance of organ donation on January 30, Mr. Vishal said.Later, Renni D’Souza, member of Juvenile Justice Board, Dakshina Kannada, delivered a lecture on Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.Rekha Hegde, advocate, spoke on Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Rohini, District Health and Family Welfare Officer, explained the PCPNDT Act.
