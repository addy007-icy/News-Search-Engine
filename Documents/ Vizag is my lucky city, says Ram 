A freezing charm casts a spell on viewers when actor Ram Pothineni dashes into the studio to interact with his fans, who could barely contain their excitement as they waited a few long moments to meet their hero.Flanked by the stunning Keerthi Suresh, who played the lady lead in ‘Nenu…Sailaja’, and director Kishore Tirumala, Ram, who came to the city, said that Vizag had been his lucky city for more reasons than one.“Most part of Nenu…Sailaja has been canned in the port city. Moreover, the peppy numbers, ‘Om Namaste Bolo’, in ‘Ready’ and “It’s a crazy crazy crazy crazy feeling” in my recent flick, shot in my favourite city, turned out to be the biggest hits,” Ram reasons. Garbed in chocolate brown shirt and a pair of dark grey jeans, Ram says that he does not have any dream role per se. “But yes, I dream about the roles I get to play,” he says after cutting a cake and sharing a piece with his team at Radio City 91.1 FM. After working in a dozen Telugu films, the bearded hero says that he strives to strike a balance between romantic movies and action-oriented ones.“However, as an actor, I like experimenting with different genres,” says Ram, flashing a disarming smile. In real life, is he close to the character of Nenu…Sailaja , who proposes to every girl he comes across right from his school days?“I am completely opposite to Hari’s character essayed in the film. Basically, I am a very shy person and will take my own time to open up,” the hero confesses.Apart from training for three years in Kung Fu, the actor has been in and out of a series of crash courses to pick up the nuances of effortless dancing.Ram says that he follows a healthy eating concept consciously and calls himself a big time foodie.He says, “It is an arduous task for me to exercise control over the diet. But yes, I eat smaller portions more frequently and workout meticulously to keep myself fit.”
