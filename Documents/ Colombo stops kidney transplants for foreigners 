Taking a dim view of reports emanating from Telangana on alleged involvement of Sri Lankan doctors and hospitals in a kidney racket, the Sri Lankan government on Thursday announced a “temporary ban” on kidney transplantation at all hospitals in the country for foreigners.The hospitals included private institutions, Rajitha Senaratne, Cabinet spokesperson and Health Minister, said. The government’s action follows the arrest of three persons early this week in Nalgonda for having facilitated 60 kidney transplantations. Cases were filed against six Sri Lankan doctors for transplants in violation of ethics.
