With criticism mounting from different quarters on pedestrian fatalities in the chaotic East Fort area after Sunday’s death of a man, the City police have initiated steps aimed at pedestrian safety.These steps are apart from the hopes that various agencies and elected bodies would complete delayed civic works or install pedestrian safety mechanisms in the area.The first of the steps revolves around the traffic safety awareness campaign the police have taken out in the other areas in the city recently through distribution of pamphlets. In East Fort, the campaign launched on Monday had pamphlets focussing exclusively on pedestrians. The campaign was launched in association with the Thiruvananthapuram Road Development Company Ltd (TRDCL). The pamphlet says most of the victims of fatal road accidents across the world are pedestrians, and that it is nothing but carelessness that leads to most accidents.Asking people to avoid walking along roads and to use footpaths instead, the pamphlet also cautions against jumping signals to cross the road and reckless road crossing practices.The City police will also begin an announcement system at East Fort, aimed primarily at pedestrians, but to include warnings for reckless bus drivers as well, from Tuesday.With the State School Arts Festival to begin on Tuesday and the main venue of Putharikandam Maidanam being in the heart of the East Fort area, the police are also planning speed restrictions in the area during the festival period. The announcements, hoped to ensure safety of the thousands of students and others reaching the spot over the next five days, are likely to be continued after the event as well, K. Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order), said.Meanwhile, the DCP submitted a report on Monday to the State Police Chief on Sunday’s events, reiterating that there was no delay on part of the police in making arrangements to shift the victim to hospital. It is learnt that the police is also probing why a ‘108’ ambulance could not reach the spot before the police ambulance, which was not as well equipped as the former for such situations.City police initiate steps, distribute pamphletsAnnouncement system to be in place
