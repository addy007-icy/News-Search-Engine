A cache of arms and ammunition has been purportedly recovered from a gym instructor in North Delhi’s Burari after the police arrested him in connection with another case.Though the arrest and recoveries were made just ahead of the Republic Day, the police have so far not found anything linking the arrested man Amit Kumar to any terror group.However, all angles are being probed, they added. The exercise has ensured the fact that three cases of attempt to murder were worked out, claimed the police.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Madhur Verma said the recoveries include both firearms and sharp-edged weapons, including a sword, cartridges and other ammunition.“We have recovered a country-made gun, ‘khukhri’ knives, a sword, 18 cartridge of 12 bore, 6 cartridge of 315 bore, 1 cartridge of self-loading rifle, 6 cartridge of 32 bore, 11 cartridge of 7.62 bore, one Bayonet of AK-47 rifle and one rod have been recovered from his possession,” said Mr. Verma.The police are now questioning Amit to find out if he has more weapons which he may have kept with someone else.On what blew off the lid from this cache, Mr. Verma said it was the probe of another incident on January 18 when the accused had a fight with the driver of Gramin Sewa Azad.“Their vehicles had brushed past each other. Following an argument, Amit injured the Gramin Sewa driver on his head and ran away from the spot. Accordingly, a case of attempt to commit culpable homicide was registered,” said Mr. Verma.
