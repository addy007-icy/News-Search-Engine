Holding BJP leaders responsible for the suicide of Vemula Rohith, a student of Hyderabad Central University, CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna on Tuesday demanded that the government order an inquiry into the incident by a sitting Judge of the High Court and initiate stringent action those who forced the student to end his life.“We have information that a Union Minister and an MLC – both from the BJP – are involved in the circumstances that led to Rohith’s suicide. Unless the government acts quickly and orders an inquiry, there is every possibility of someone altering records to shield the accused,” Mr. Ramakrishna said here.Accusing the Viswa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swaymsevak Sangh of involving in every issue ever since the BJP was voted to power at the Centre and trying to “saffronise” academics, Mr. Ramakrishna said that steps should be taken without fail to protect the education system from the influence of communal forces.
