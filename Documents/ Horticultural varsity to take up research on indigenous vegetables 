The University of Horticultural Sciences-Bagalkot has taken up research on indigenous and largely unpopular vegetables in the State in a bid to promote them. As a first step, a study will be conducted on the properties of wild melon, which belongs to the Cucumis melo category.Vasant Ganiger, Professor in the Vegetable Science Department, who is heading the research, says that Karnataka has several indigenous varieties of vegetable which have medicinal properties.“Wild melon is one such variety which is known to almost every farmer in north Karnataka belongs to the region. Yet, this vegetable with anti-oxidant properties is not so popular among people,” Prof. Ganiger said.He said that as per initial studies, it had been found that several varieties of this drought-resistant vegetable had an acidic-sweet taste and there were bitter types too. While those with acidic-sweet taste could be used for preparing curry and pickles and could be kept for nearly a month, those with bitter taste could help diabetic patients reduce sugar level.Prof. Ganiger said that as this vegetable had plenty of seeds, he was trying to find out whether they could be used to extract oil.“ If the presence of oil is found in its seeds, they could be a good alternative to oil seeds.The farmer could cultivate it extensively as it will give them higher revenue. As it is drought resistant, it can be cultivated in the drought-prone district,” he said.He said that he had identified some 24 varieties of wild melon found in Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts for research.In future, he plans to conduct research on other varieties such as lettuce.“ If these vegetables become popular, then they could be a better alternative to traditional vegetables. It will also encourage farmers to cultivate them,” Prof. Ganiger said.
