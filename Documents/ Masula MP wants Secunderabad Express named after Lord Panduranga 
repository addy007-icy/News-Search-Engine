Machilipatnam Member of Parliament K. Narayana has appealed to the South Central Railway authorities to name the Machilipatnam-Secunderabad Express after Lord Ponduranga Swami.Mr. Narayana raised questions about several pending railway projects in Krishna District during a special meeting with the South Central Railway General Manager Ravindra Gupta on Thursday.“The people of Machilipatnam are strongly demanding naming of the Secunderabad Express after Panduranga Swami. The railway authorities should consider the sentiment of the local people in this regard”, said Mr. Narayana.The demands raised by Mr. Narayana were including extension of Pinakini Express from Machilipatnam to Chennai instead of Vijayawada, adding first class AC coach facility for the trains plying between Machilipatnam and Secunderabad.
