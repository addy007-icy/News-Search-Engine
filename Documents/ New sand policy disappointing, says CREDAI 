The State government which promised to make sand available at an affordable rate has effectively put it out of reach of common man by pegging its price at Rs. 500 a cubic metre, CREDAI Visakhapatnam Chapter said.In the last one-and-a-half year sand had become a vexatious issue and the promise of the government that it would come out with a new policy, taking into account the interest of all stakeholders raised hopes of all concerned, secretary, CREDAI Visakhapatnam Chapter, B. Srinivasa Rao, said in a statement here on Saturday.Plugging the loopholes in the sand policy, checking irregularities and ensuring uninterrupted supply at cheaper rates were the declared objectives of the proposed new sand policy.The State government unilaterally announcing the policy of e-auctioning sand reaches and fixing the rate of sand at Rs 500 per cubic metre dashed the hopes among the stakeholders.Even after taking into consideration the expenditure like payment of seigniorage, loading charges and maintenance of sand reaches the cost of one cubic metre of sand would not go beyond Rs. 150 to Rs. 175. Even after making allowance for reasonable profit to the auctioneers, the rate should be pegged at Rs. 200 to Rs. 250 per cubic metre.CREDAI Visakhapatnam Chapter secretary B. Srinivasa Rao says the present sand rate of Rs. 500 per cubic metre is exorbitantly high
