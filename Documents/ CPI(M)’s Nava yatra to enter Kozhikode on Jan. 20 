The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] has decided to make the Nava Kerala Yatra being led by Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan a historic event in Kozhikode district.The party machinery has geared up for the three-day programme in the district. The yatra will enter the district on January 20 and it will be accorded receptions at 12 centres in 13 Assembly constituencies.This is the fourth time Mr. Vijayan is undertaking a State-wide yatra. Two of them were of similar nature taken out ahead of the Assembly polls in 2004 and 2009, but the one in 2014 was prior to the Lok Sabha polls.CPI (M) district secretary P. Mohanan told The Hindu on Thursday that the yatra would focus on three aspects including countering the Hindutva campaign unleashed by BJP-RSS and highlighting the misrule of the Congress-led UDF government. Besides, it would lay emphasis on development needs of the State.The Nava Kerala Yatra will enter Kozhikode after touring Wayanad. It will be received by the party red volunteers and band troupes at Adivaram bordering Kozhikode- Wayanad districts at 9 a.m. on January 20.The first reception will be at Mukkom in Thiruvambady Assembly segment, followed by at Thamarassery, Ulliyeri and Perambra.On the second day, the yatra will commence from Nadapuram, meetings at Ayyancherry, Vadakkara and Koyilandy. Receptions have been planned at Kakkodi Bazaar, Mavoor, Feroke and Kozhikode beach on the third day.About 15,000 to 20,000 people will take part at each reception centre. Kozhikode South and Kozhikode North will organise a combined reception on the beach at 5 p.m.All local committees have been galvanised to constitute booth-level committees for the success of the yatra. Assembly-wise marches have already been taken out by leaders announcing the importance of the yatra, Mr. Mohanan said.He said that former leaders, sympathisers, kith and kin of martyrs, family members of party workers, social and cultural leaders would take part in these receptions.
