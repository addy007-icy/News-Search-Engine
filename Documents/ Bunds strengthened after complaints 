he Water Resources Department has started strengthening the bund of Adyar river at a few places in the city’s southern suburbs, reportedly the first time in many years. The State government is reported to have sanctioned very little money for the work and at present, work on strengthening the bund is being carried out for a small stretch between Tirumudivakkam and Tiruneermalai, sources said.Sources said that due to obstructions at many spots where other channels flow into the river, there was reverse flow of water, resulting in the flooding of residential localities along it. Further, weak bunds of the Adyar river resulted in breaches too. The present operation was to strengthen the bunds and also to clear the silt that obstructed channels draining water into the river, sources said.The WRD has been involved in the operations at Thirumudivakkam, a small village panchayat, off Grand Southern Trunk Road also after residents of Thiruneermalai, Thirumudivakkam, Anakaputhur and Gowl Bazaar complained about an increase in mosquito menace in their areas.The department has also deployed two earthmovers to remove sand at the River’s mouth near Pattinapakkam. Normally, the department cleans the mouths of both the Cooum and Adyar rivers frequently. But now, sand is being removed following the flood. The present work, officials said, was only a preliminary one. They have plans to execute similar works in the weeks to come, for which they need funds from the State government.
