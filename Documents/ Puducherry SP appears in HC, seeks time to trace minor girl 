A day after the Madras High Court warned that it would summon the Inspector General of Police (IG) of Puducherry if a missing minor girl is not traced and produced before the court, the Superintendent of Police of the Union Territory on Tuesday appeared before the court and sought a day’s time to trace her.The issue pertains to a habeas corpus petition moved by P.Jayamoorthy, a resident of Kadhirkamam seeking a direction to the Puducherry police to trace and produce his 17-year-old daughter who was missing since Friday.On Monday, the petition was urgently moved by way of a lunch motion before the Division Bench of Justices R. Sudhakar and P.N. Prakash. Admitting the petition the bench warned that the court would summon the IG if the girl is not traced by Monday night and produced before the court on Tuesday.Advocate Stalin Abhimanyu who appeared for the petitioner told The Hindu , “When the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, Puducherry Superintendent of Police Abdul Rahim and the jurisdictional Inspector of Police Senthil Kumar appeared before the Bench and assured that the girl will be secured by Tuesday night.”Recoding the submission, the Bench directed the officials to file a status report on Wednesday and posted the case to January 21 for producing the girl.According to the petitioner, on January 15 his daughter, who is studying in class XII, left the house to attend a special class conducted at her school around 5.30 pm. Since she did not return late at night, he enquired with school authorities. Later, his daughter’s friend informed him that she did not attend the special class on that day.Suspecting that a teacher could be behind his daughter going missing, he impleaded the teacher and the school’s correspondent as parties to his petition.
