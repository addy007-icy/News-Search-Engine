The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) general secretary and CPI (M) MP Tapan Sen has defended the all India bank strike on Friday stating that the merger of associate banks with SBI, against which the strike was called, was a bigger project of the government to squeeze the area of operation for nationalised banks and create space for private and corporate banks.Addressing a press conference on Thursday on the sidelines of the national conference of All India Federation of Anganwadi Workers and Helpers, Mr. Sen said the trade unions which gave the strike call will not take on its face value the claim of the government that the merger was taken up to solve the capitalisation problem of SBI. In fact, the merger was aimed to close down several bank branches and favour the private banks.Anti-worker policiesHe criticised the anti-worker policies of BJP led NDA government saying they served foreign and domestic corporates to the exclusion of the other.The foreign companies were favoured in the form of unhindered import of steel and metal from Korea, Japan and Russia at the cost of domestic market. The anti-dumping provisions were deliberately not invoked against them.The government created a false feel good atmosphere about economic growth touching 7 per cent mark though the output of manufacturing sector in December went down. The trade unions were waiting for presentation of Union budget to launch an agitation against the policies, he added.
