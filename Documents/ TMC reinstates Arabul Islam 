Months before the Assembly elections in the State, the Trinamool Congress took back “expelled” strongman Arabul Islam into the party fold on Wednesday.The announcement was made at a party workers’ meeting in the Bhangar area by South 24 Parganas district president and the mayor of Kolkata, Sovan Chatterjee.Amid loud applause by the party workers, Mr. Chatterjee addressed Mr. Islam as his “younger brother” and said that “90 per cent of party workers” have demanded his return.“We want correction (of Arabul). From today he is a party member as well as part of the panchayat samity,” said Mr. Chatterjee.Interestingly, another party leader and a known rival of Mr. Islam, Kaisar Ahmed was also reinstated as the bloc committee president on the same dais. Not only did the two rivals share the dais but they also put party badges on each other amid loud cheers from party workers.In what is being seen as the party leadership’s bid to curb faction feuds ahead of the polls, Mr. Chatterjee said: “Our leader Mamata Banerjee will decide who will contest from Bhangar and we will work together under her leadership.”Mr. Islam was “expelled” for six years in October 2014 in the wake of the death of two party workers in the area due to reported faction feud.
