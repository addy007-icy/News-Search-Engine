The State government has honoured 26-year old S. Mohammad Yunus for his “selfless, noble and brave act” of rescuing nearly 2,100 people during the recent floods that devastated Chennai.“If you had met me a few months back, you would have been shocked. I used to work like a money-making machine. I was never a social person. The floods taught me a great lesson. It was an eye-opener to me,” he said after receiving the ‘Anna Medal for Gallantry’ from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at the 67 Republic Day celebrations.Now, he wants to teach politics and reform the youth. “I’m developing an app with focus on entrepreneurship, reforms and politics. It will be up ready and operational in three months. This will be similar to social networking apps,” Mr. Yunus said.Mr. Yunus is looking for funding for his new venture of developing apps. “I’m looking for Venture Capital funding and some have already approached. You will see something big.” Entrepreneurship is not new to him. Yunus runs a real estate firm that helps middle class families search properties based on algorithm.According to the citation, Mr. Yunus was instrumental in the rescue of nearly 1,500 people during the November 17 floods and accommodated them in nearly 300 houses.On December 2, he rescued nearly 600 people when the city went underwater. He also rescued a pregnant woman, Chitra, along with her husband Mohan in Urapakkam and admitted her at a hospital in Perungalathur.Chitra gave birth to a girl baby a day later and the couple named their daughter Yunus. People who came to watch the Republic Day parade queued up to take a photograph with the young man.
