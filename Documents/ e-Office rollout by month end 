The District Collectorate here will be logged on to the electronic office (e-Office) system by the end of January as the process of migrating to the new mode is now in its final stage.Though the rollout was to be completed by December end, it is now rescheduled because of the delay in procurement of hardware as part of upgrading the existing system. In the first phase, the e-Office upgrading — covering 15 sections of the Collectorate — will be completed by January ens. The Collectorate here is one of the seven in the State to move to the e-Office mode.“We have already brought 10 of the 15 sections under the e-Office system,” said District Collector P. Bala Kiran. The remaining sections would be upgraded to the new system by the month-end, he told The Hindu on Saturday. Noting that there was rapid progress in the upgrading work, Mr. Kiran said that 1,200th e-File was approved by January 1.Manual digitisationThe e-Office, being implemented in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC), involves migration of documents from the existing DC Suite filing system to the new mode and the manual digitisation of all documents and files.“The migration of files from the DC Suite will be completed by the end of this month,” District Informatics Officer Andrews Varghese said adding that the process of transferring the files from the DC Suite to the migration server was already under way.The migration of other documents and files to the new system would take some more time, he said.Sub Collector’s officeWork is also on to bring the Sub Collector’s office at Thalassery under the e-Office system.
