District Congress Committee (DCC) president Taher bin Hamdan advised Congress MLC candidate K. Venkatramana Reddy, who withdrew from the contest paving the way for unanimous election of TRS nominee R. Bhupathi Reddy, not to sling mud on the Congress and its leaders for his betrayal.Refuting the allegations made by Mr. Venkatramana Reddy against the senior party leaders, he said it was unfair on his part and his charges were baseless and unfounded. Contrary to his claims that there was no leader in Congress to contest the MLC election and therefore the ticket was given to him, Mr. Hamdan said that many applied for the seat but seeing his family background and his political career the party favoured his candidature.At a press conference here on Sunday, the DCC president said that as per the information available with his party, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao talked to Mr. Reddy through the mobile phone of one Ranjith Reddy to withdraw the nomination. “Hence, the former ZP chairman would have moral right to talk against the Congress only after making public the details of the conversation held between him and the Chief Minister,” he said.Mr. Hamdan said that Mr. Venkatramana Reddy was only an ordinary member in the party, and as the DCC president he was empowered to suspend the latter from the party.However, the matter was already pending with the TPCC and the party high command and they would take a decision for his expulsion soon, he added.DCC general secretary Dayakar Goud was also present.DCC president alleges that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao talked to Venkatramana Reddy through the mobile phone of one Ranjith Reddy to withdraw his MLC nomination
