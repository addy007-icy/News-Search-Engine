Telangana Government’s decision to include transgender persons under the Backward Classes has not evoked much enthusiasm from the community’s representatives here, though BC leader and legislator R.Krishnaiah went to press against the decision.Vis-à-vis the numbers and diversity of BCs in the State, the benefits that could be reaped by transgender persons will be insignificant, opined the Telangana Hijra Transgender Samiti members.“It is not an ideal situation for the transgenders to be competing with the rest of the BCs who would be clearly in a better position than the former.Even for a dalit transgender, to be clubbed with the rest of the dalits is no relief,” said Karthik Bittu from the Samiti.There should be separate quota for transgenders cutting across all communities, the members feel.Other members including Vyjayanthi and Rachana are keener that the Telangana government constitute a Commission for protection of the rights of transgenders.
