The Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation (APCCIF) appealed to the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to take steps for the full-fledged functioning of the office of Joint DGFT in Vijayawada to cater to foreign trade in the region.APCCIF president-elect M. Murali Krishna and Executive Director P. Bhaskar Rao stated in a press release that DGFT has been operating from Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam in the united AP.The Visakhapatnam office catered to Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East and West Godavari districts and all other districts were under the purview of Hyderabad office. Post-bifurcation, the DGFT set up a temporary office in Vijayawada in April 2015 by taking into consideration the slew of initiatives taken by the Government of A.P for promoting industries, particularly the development of 10 new seaports, on the APCCIF premises. But, it has since abandoned its activities. As a consequence, the progress of foreign trade was adversely affected.Potential investors needed guidance thereof but the absence of a fully functional JDGFT office hampered the growth. The DGFT should therefore take necessary action at the earliest, the APCCIF office-bearers appealed.
