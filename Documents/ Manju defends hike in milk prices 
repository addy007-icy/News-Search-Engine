Manju has defended the increase in milk price. “Considering the plight of milk producers and their unions, the State government has approved the hike in milk prices,” he said at a press conference here on Monday.The milk prices prevailing in Karnataka were less than those in neighbouring States. Even after the upward revision, the milk prices in Karnataka remained less than those ruling in other States. “The decision to increase milk prices has been taken in the interest of the State’s agricultural sector, although it has hurt consumers a little. I appeal to the public to purchase Nandini products to strengthen the Karnataka Milk Federation and help milk producers,” he said.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would visit Hassan on Thursday to inaugurate many schemes, including the inauguration of the veterinary college, medical college building and a few others. “The State government will pay equal attention to all developmental works related to Hassan.
