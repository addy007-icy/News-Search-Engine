Pushpavathi Amarnath, president of Mysuru Zilla Panchayat, has directed all executive officers of the taluk panchayat to identify government lands in each village and convert them into threshing yards. She has also directed the Agriculture Department to provide necessary equipment to enable farmers to thresh their harvests.The executive officers have been told to send a proposal to purchase private lands if there were no government lands in any village and get it approved from the government. She also mooted the idea of hiring lands during the harvest season and asked Joint Director of Agriculture Department M. Mahanteshappa to find out from senior officials if lands could be taken on rent for threshing crops.Chairing the Karnataka Development Programme review meeting here on Monday, Ms. Amarnath suggested to the executive officers to construct threshing yards with the convergence funds available. Mr. Mahanteshappa said that finger millets (ragi), sorghum (jowar), and horse gram harvests are spread on roads. This leaves road users angry as they have to slow down and negotiate through piles of grain stalks, he said. Mr. Mahanteshappa said that there was a scheme to provide threshing yards to farmers till last year, but the government withdrew it as the Union government had allowed formation of threshing yards in government lands and even in private fields under the MNREGA.Meanwhile, Ms. Amarnath was furious over the absence of many officers at the meeting. When she was told about the officials attending other meetings, she said that as per the government order no meeting should be held on 11th of the month as KDP meetings are scheduled for this date. She asked the chief executive officer to serve notice to the officials.
