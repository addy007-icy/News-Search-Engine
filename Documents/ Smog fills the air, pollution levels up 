On Thursday morning, with thick smog enveloping the entire city, the sun was just a dull disc on the eastern sky.As part of the Bhogi festivities, residents burnt garbage and discarded items, causing pollution levels to go up in nine locations across the city.The station at Manali in north Chennai recorded the highest pollution levels with respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) being 298 microgram/cubic metre (24-hour average).The station at Perungudi had the lowest pollution levels with 112 microgram/cubic metre of RSPM. With fine ash dust from the fires mixing with the fog, the levels were well above the permissible limit of 100 microgram/cubic metre everywhere.The smog, which was recorded from 3 a.m., led to delay in flights taking off and landing at the Chennai airport. Most flight operations were affected with delays ranging from 45 minutes to even an hour and a half, airport sources said. Flights, including Air India, Emirates, Jet Airways, SpiceJet and IndiGo were delayed as the visibility on the runway had dipped.Officials of the Airport Meteorological office (AMO), Meenambakkam, said the visibility in localities around the airport dropped to 250 metres from 5 a.m. It improved only after 8 a.m.P.A.V. Nampoothiri, director, AMO, said the office had forecasted that visibility would be up to 500 metres. High humidity level of over 80 per cent also contributed to the presence of fog.Apart from limited visibility and flight delays, the smog also led to health problems.“I had a coughing fit that left a burning feeling in my throat,” said K. Umadevi, a resident of Manali.Mrinalini Chandrasekar, a resident of Royapuram, said that since she lived on the first floor, she was able to smell a lot of smoke.(Additional reporting by Sunitha Sekar)
