The bed strength of the Asramam ESI Super Specialty Hospital in the city will be increased to 300 from the present 200.This was said by N.K. Premachandran, MP, during a visit to the hospital on Monday.Mr. Premachandran told press persons that the assurance on increasing the bed strength of the hospital was given to him by Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya when he met the Minister and the Director General of the Employees State Insurance Corporation Deepak Kumar last week in Delhi.Mr. Premachandran, who held talks with the hospital authorities during the visit, suggested that the cashew workers of the public sector Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation (KSCDC) should not be denied treatment because of non-payment of ESI dues, as the KSCDC factories were lying closed. Hospital superintendent Romi Khurana said that the matter would be considered.Lack of infrastructure is one of the serious problems faced by the hospital. The main building is more than 60 years old.During 2014-2015, the hospital attended to 2,63,834 out-patients, 25,617 at the casualty, and 15,315 as in-patients.Mr. Premachandran said that a new building to suit the needs of the time was important and a proposal for the same had been sent to the ESIC headquarters.He said that steps were under way to modernise various departments of the hospital and also appoint more doctors.He said that the hospital lacked a neurology wing and it was important that this wing was soon opened there.
