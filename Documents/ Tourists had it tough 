Those who chose to celebrate the New Year by driving out of Delhi to other locations had a tough time getting back home on Friday. Fearing being impounded on day one of the odd-even scheme, scores of city dwellers waited for the clock to tick 8 p.m. to enter Delhi.For Nayantara Sharma who works with an advertising agency in Hauz Khaz, the odd-even plan compelled her to miss office on January 1, she claims. “I had booked a New Year package for my family at Neemrana in Rajasthan almost three months in advance and then this odd-even plan happened. I was to join office on January 1, but could not as both my cars are even numbered. We had to hover around Gurgaon until 8 p.m. to avoid being challaned,” she said.The odd-even formula has now forced people to plan their road-trips in advance. Another couple returning from their trip to Shimla said that they felt “stranded” because of the plan. “I am not even a resident of Delhi. I had to add one more day to my holiday as the way back home is only via Delhi and my car number is even,” said Anshuman Bhati, a resident of Noida. “We support the move, but they should have kept the New Year in mind. Most families go out of Delhi to celebrate the New Year. The formula should have been implemented from January 4 which is a Monday,” added his wife.While city dwellers mostly complied to the scheme and scheduled their day accordingly, Many tourists visiting Delhi from other States in cars were taken by surprise. Rupesh Singh and his family were coming from Haridwar to the Capital only to be impounded by the traffic police. “They should have exempted tourists at least,” he sighed.The odd-even formula has forced people to plan their road-trips in advance
