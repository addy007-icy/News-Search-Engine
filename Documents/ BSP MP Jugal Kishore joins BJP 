Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Jugal Kishore on Friday joined the BJP, a move the saffron party claims will help it woo Dalit voters in Uttar Pradesh, which will go to the polls early next year.Mr. Kishore accused BSP supremo Mayawati of “selling” Dalit votes and insisted that it was BJP, which is working to fulfil the aspirations of the community.“She is no longer a ‘Dalit ke beti’ (Dalit’s daughter). She has become a ‘daulat ki beti’ (daughter of wealth). She is selling the votes of Dalits,” he said.BJP leader Om Prakash Mathur, who is its Uttar Pradesh in-charge, said the people of the State have decided to vote the party in a same way they did in the Lok Sabha elections.“We were waiting for the auspicious Makar Sankranti and from now onwards every day different leaders will join the party in the State,” Mr. Mathur said.
