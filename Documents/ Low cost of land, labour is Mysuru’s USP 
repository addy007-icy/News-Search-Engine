Ready availability of land at relatively cheaper rates will be a major factor cementing Mysuruâ€™s USP as a new investment destination after Bengaluru.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah recently laid the foundation stone for a new industrial area spread over Tandya, Adakanahalli and Immavu in Nanjangud-Mysuru region. The vast swathe of industrial land is spread across 2,312.24 acres of which Immavu has 1,085.09 acres, while Tandya has 554.15 acres. Adakanahalli plot is spread over 673 acres and all these areas are contiguous making development easy.Land will not be a dithering factor in future for genuine investors and is relatively cheap when compared to the cost in Bengaluru. Suresh Kumar Jain of MIA said an acre of land acquired from KIADB will cost around Rs. 35 lakh to Rs. 40 lakh in the Mysuru region while it will cost not less than Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 2 crore in Bengaluru. All this will be highlighted during Invest Karnataka-2016.Another raw material, water, is relatively found in abundance in Mysuru compared to Bengaluru. On the connectivity front, Mysuru is better compared to other cities as its proximity to Bengaluru is an advantage. Though lack of commercial flights to Mysuru is a handicap, the track doubling between Mysuru and Bengaluru is officially over but for a 1.5 km stretch and electrification is under way, which will reduce the commuting time to less than 2 hours.While there is a vast pool of human resource to draw to the labour force, it is highly untrained as a majority of the youth in the region are from villages with agricultural background. But a new skill development centre under Skill India Initiative is being launched at Nanjangud to train youth for various industrial jobs.
