Since its creation in 1974, the Rubik’s Cube has topped the list of best-selling toys. And not without reason. It is an excellent way to keep the mind active and also teaches you the importance of every single move. The traditional cube has six faces with nine cells on each face, with each face having a different colour. Once solved, each face has to have cells of the same colour. There are many ways to solve the cube, and there are no tricks or cheat codes. Each time, you can arrive at the solution differently.Sixteen-year-olds Suraj Sanjay and Sripad Sarma from Chennai can solve a 3x3 Rubik’s cube in 10 and nine seconds, respectively. On learning how to solve it by applying algorithms and mathematical theories, they recently conducted a three-day workshop at Ashvita Nirvana, Besant Nagar, to impart that knowledge to others.The workshop had three sessions, — clearing layers, positioning and arranging — with a day devoted to each. Says Suraj, “This is my third workshop. Cubing is addictive. Once I got to know the solution, I focussed on speed cubing. We apply algorithms and simple formulae while solving cubes. Sripad and I focus on teaching the techniques in a manner that is easy to understand. This will help others play it better.” Other ways of solving the cube are blindfolded, multiple blindfolded, using a single hand, using one’s feet, and solving it using very few moves.Neel, a 10-year-old, was able to solve the cubes on the second day of the workshop. “I have been trying to solve Rubik’s Cube for the last two years. The workshop helped me crack the idea codes. I managed to solve my cube. Then, I shuffled it again and tried speedcubing,” he says.
