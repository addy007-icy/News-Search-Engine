Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao said that for the first time in history, water is being supplied to 48 villages in Patancheru constituency from Ellampally via Hyderabad.Speaking to reporters here on Saturday along with Collector Ronald Rose after visiting Manjeera dam and Chepiryal filter bed, the Minister said that the water level in Manjeera is down to dead storage level. Hence, it was decided to dig a canal for 19 kilometres and supply water, which may meet the requirements of Sangareddy, Sadashivapet, Jogipet and Narsapur for the next five to six months. Twenty-five cusecs of water will be released per day for all schemes, he added.
