Representatives of the Animal Welfare Board of India, Human Society International/India, and People for Animals (PFA), Hyderabad, on Friday urged the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for swift implementation of the High Court orders to ensure that no animal was harmed in the name of entertainment.At a press conference held to highlight the harm to cocks when they are released in the rink for fights in some districts of Andhra Pradesh during Sankranti, advocates Naumene representing the Animal Welfare Board, Rachna Reddy, counsel for PFA, and Vasanthi Vadi, secretary of PFA, emphasised that in the name of ‘tradition’ and ‘entertainment’, cockfights could not be allowed to continue.They pointed out that the Prevention of Cruelty Act of 1960 itself was against any harm to animals and birds. When that was the case, how could the government allow it to go on for this long, they asked.
