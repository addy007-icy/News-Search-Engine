A Labrador, which belongs to a Government Railway Police (GRP) inspector and was guarding the railway police station at Tambaram, has gone missing.Two-and-half-year-old Bharathi was a find of GRP Inspector S. Sekar, who gave shelter to the dog two years ago when he found it on the Perambur railway station premises.Mr. Sekar said the dog, that was six months old then was ferocious when threatened by strangers.“I used to take her on my rounds inside the station and she never disobeyed me. She helped us keep the station secure,” Mr. Sekar said.“My enquiries with neighbouring stations proved futile and no one could trace her whereabouts,” said Mr. Sekar.Someone might have lured the dog away, he added.
