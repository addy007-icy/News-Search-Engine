It is disgraceful that the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre has allegedly pushed an RSS-backed agenda in the choice of papers presented at the recently held Indian Science Congress. At a conference meant to deliberate scientific developments and innovations based on reasoning and concrete evidence, it is unfortunate that papers trying to establish myths as scientific developments were allowed to be read out (“‘Shiva as environmentalist’ causes stir at science meet,” Jan.07). By calling Lord Shiva a great environmentalist and declaring the blowing of a conch shell ( shankh) as having medical effects, the participants have not only become a laughing stock in the eyes of the world but have also insulted our scientific knowledgeTharcius S.
