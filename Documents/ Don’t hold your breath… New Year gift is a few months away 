What was announced as a New Year’s gift to the city — the East West corridor of the Metro line connecting Byappanahalli and Mysuru Road — may take a ‘few more months’ to become operational.Though trials on the stretch have been going on for the past two months, BMRCL said the Commissioner of Railway Safety, who has to give the final go ahead, is yet to be approached. Tentatively, Metro says the request may be sent only by January-end.However, if one goes by the experience of the Magadi Road line, commencement of operations may be some months away. It took seven months after trials began for the CRS – who was preoccupied with other railway investigations – to give the green signal for the line.For the trials in the underground section between M.G. Road station and Magadi Road station, Namma Metro had for the first time in India employed the Instrumented Measuring Wheel, a pair of wheels imported from Sweden which are fitted with GPS, gyroscope and many other modern instruments. They were fitted on a coach.For over six nights, the coach zoomed on the lines at over 90kmph.Officials were also testing the steep curves (around 120m radius between Minsk Square station and Vidhana Soudha, which is not seen in other metros).Apart from over 75 engineers, members of the Research Designs & Standards Organization also took part in the tests.Better prepared for Phase IILearning from the struggles in burrowing underneath a city that sits on mounds of quartzite, granite and hard rock, BMRCL hopes to be better prepared for Phase II, which features a larger underground section. Phase I has 8 km of underground lines.BMRCL officials said borewell rock testing for Phase I – to ascertain the kind of geology – was carried out at intervals of 100 metres along the line, depending on availability of space. However, with the second phase having 13.79-km of underground lines, metro officials said testing will be carried out at intervals of around 25 metres.
