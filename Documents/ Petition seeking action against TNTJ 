Sunnath Jamath Federation of Coimbatore District (comprising around 70 Jamaths in the district) petitioned the City Police Commissioner here on Monday, seeking action against Tamil Nadu Thowheeth Jamath (TNTJ) for its alleged activities that “hurt the sentiments” of a section of the community.General secretary of the federation for Coimbatore district, M.A. Inayathulla, said that TNTJ was organising a conference in Tiruchirapalli on January 31 against mosques, and other religious practices of many Muslims. “In this connection, they displayed posters and banners in the city on Sunday,” he said.At Karumbukadai, a clash broke between a Sunnath Jamath representative and a section of the TNTJ cadre when the latter affixed a banner about the conference on the wall of a mosque. “The group beat up the youth who opposed them. A case was registered in this connection at the Kuniamuthur police Station on Sunday,” he added.Claiming that the campaign organised by the TNTJ would disturb normalcy, the Sunnath Jamath representatives urged the police to put an end to the propaganda by TNTJ members and the Tamil Nadu Government to deny permission for the conference.
