The Delhi University administration’s decision to allow a seminar on Ram Janmabhoomi temple in the varsity by a Vishva Hindu Parishad-affiliated outfit has drawn flak from both the teachers and students, who termed the move as an “attempt to vitiate and communalise the campus”.However, DU clarified stating it has nothing to do with the subject of the seminar and that the organisation had booked the venue for the event.The two-day seminar, titled “Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple: Emerging Scenario”, begins from Saturday. It is being organised at the Arts Faculty by Arundhati Vashishtha Anusandhan Peeth, a research organisation founded by late VHP leader Ashok Singhal.Speaking on the issue, a senior DU official said: “The seminar is not being organised by any of the university’s departments. Anyone can book the venue through the Office of the Assistant Registrar.”Various student groups and teachers have opposed DU’s decision to offer its campus for the non-academic event.“What have these kinds of events to do with the academic sphere? First, the JNU administration tries to invite Baba Ramdev for talks at the Vedic Congress, then DU gives permission to organise a seminar like this. This is an indication of the government pushing its saffron agenda in education,” said a statement by the All India Students’ Association.The Students’ Federation of India added: “The DU administration must withdraw permission for the seminar as it is a clear attempt to vitiate and communalise the campus. We demand that permission to conduct this programme be withdrawn.”The Delhi University Teachers’ Association said events that are communal in nature should not get any space in educational institutions.“The holding of a seminar on such a nationally divisive issue is a blatant misuse of the university. We may recall the recent controversies around moves to hold programmes in JNU and Allahabad University with Ramdev and Yogi Adityanath as participants. Both moves were successfully resisted by students.”
