Two sentences in “A fourth of court cases in TN over five years old” (City, Jan. 24, 2016) erroneously read: “Referring to recent incidents of disciplinary action being initiated against a section of lawyers, the Chief Justice said judges did gain any pleasure from punishing lawyers. Pointing out that courts could not be closed to the litigant public in the guise of boycotts, he said , adding, tking action against advocates had always been the last resort of the judiciary.” They should have been “judges did not gain any pleasure” and “he said taking action against advocates.” They were editing errors.
