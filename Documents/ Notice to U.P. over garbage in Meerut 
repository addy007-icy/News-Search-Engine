The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday sought the response of the Uttar Pradesh government and others on a petition by a Meerut resident seeking steps to deal with heaps of garbage being disposed of in the open and lack of proper drainage in the city.A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also issued notice to the State pollution control board, the District Magistrate of Meerut and others while seeking their reply by February 16.“What are you people doing? There is waste everywhere... Issue notice...,” the Bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea by Meerut resident Yogendra Pal Singh who has sought directions for proper collection, transport and disposal mechanism for garbage in Ganganagar colony of the district.“Garbage, including cow dung, is being dumped in many open spaces. Even in places where garbage dumps are available, the garbage is scattered all around making the place unhygienic and dirty.“Since there are no sweepers, the garbage gets piled up and rots...There are small trees and shrubs all over the vacant plots and open spaces making the place bushy and an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and other pests,” the plea, filed through advocate Momota Devi Oinam, said. -- PTI
