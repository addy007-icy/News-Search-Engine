With terror threats looming large and Republic Day celebrations just round the corner, the Delhi Police and National Security Guard (NSG) on Thursday carried out joint drills at two locations — Khan Market and Hauz Khas — to check the security preparedness and alertness levels.While the drill in Hauz Khas Village was on till late on Thursday night, senior police officers said the response time was found to be “satisfactory” in the case of Khan Market, where the drill has concluded. Joint Commissioner of Police (New Delhi Range) M.K. Meena said the response was even found improved on certain parameters. The situation given in the Khan Market case was an armed attack by gunmen.As per the standard operating procedure, the response of all units of the Delhi Police, including local police, Police Control Room, Traffic Police, the anti-terror unit, Special Cell and Specialists in Weapons and Arms Tactics (SWAT) teams, as well as co-ordination between them is assessed following the drill based on which areas of improvement are also looked into.Teams from all these units carry out the drill. Feedback on the speed with which decisions are made during an emergency is measured through wireless messages generated during the exercise, as well as senior Delhi Police officers who are at the spot monitoring the exercise.Also joining the exercise was NSG, which provided the police with a ready trained and armed component.In the last week of December, NSG and SWAT commandoes, along with the Delhi Police, had conducted mock drills at several malls, hotels and shopping complexes in Delhi.Since then, other drills have followed at crowded and vulnerable spots like Nehru Place, Vasant Kunj malls and several others.“We are planning to conduct more such exercises at repeated intervals to ensure that our men are ready for any kind of eventuality and have a first-hand experience of the crisis,” added Mr. Meena.
