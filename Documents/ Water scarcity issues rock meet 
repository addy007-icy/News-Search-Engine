Mandapeta MLA Vegulla Jogeswara Rao and his Anaparti counterpart N. Ramakrishna Reddy then asked officials of Rural Water Scheme (RWS) to furnish complete details on the status of pending schemes being implemented in their constituencies.Mr. Ananda Rao then intervened that of the 60 villages in his constituency, 48 have no overhead tanks. Though officials had put the estimates to build tanks at Rs.12 crore about 10 months ago, no further action was taken. Kothapeta MLA Chirla Jaggireddy said that RWS officials had made soil testing to dig bore-wells in 40 villages a year ago and the results were not made public.Amalapuram MP Ravindra Babu then said that it was a concern that East Godavari district, despite having plenty of water resources, was facing water woes. RWS officials have failed in preparing a macro-plan for desalination of water in Konaseema, he added.He also brought to the notice of the forum that fishermen who were spending 20 days a month in the sea were deprived of drinking water and their families were consuming salty water through out the year. MLC Somu Veerraju also hinted at villages such as Katheru on the banks of the Godavari in Rajamahendravaram Rural Mandal were facing drinking water problems.
