With the deadline fixed by the State government for clearing the arrears of welfare pensions expiring and the State heading for polls, pressure is mounting on the civic administrators to clear the pending distribution of welfare pensions.The Chief Minister had declared two weeks ago that the State government would clear the arrears of all the welfare pensions by January 18. However, it is to be seen how the government would be able to clear the backlog as promised earlier, said a civic administrator.The civic authorities are having a tough time consoling the beneficiaries who demand that the pensions should be disbursed immediately. The local bodies across the State are waiting for the government to act, especially at a time when the State is heading for Assembly polls, he said. Even as the distribution of pension is delayed, the local bodies are under pressure to approve new beneficiaries as applications attested by local councillors reach the local bodies regularly.Since the new regime led by Kochi Mayor Soumini Jain came into power, the Welfare Standing Committee of the local body had approved 700 new applications including the requests from widows, the aged and physically challenged persons. It had also cleared a few applications of agrarian workers since assuming the office.The distribution of welfare pensions has been pending for over five months. The distribution of the welfare pensions was hit following the restructuring of the money disbursal system. Earlier, the State government used to allot the funds to the Kochi Corporation for disbursal. However, it was reversed and the Ministry for Social Welfare started directly allotting the money.Local bodyâ€™s roleThe role of the local body is limited to vetting the applications and sending it to the State government after obtaining the approval of the Welfare Standing Committee and the Corporation Council, said a civic administrator.Kochi Corporation supports around 30,000 persons from the economically weaker sections including the aged and single women. Annually, the local body spends around Rs.20 crore as welfare money for these persons.The Chief Minister had declared that the government would clear the arrears by Jan 18.
