The boat house and the presence of more than 70 motor fitted, rowing and self-pedalling boats have been enthralling the tourists visiting Yercaud.However, the presence of water hyacinth in a portion of the Yercaud lake is a matter of concern to the visitors.The presence of the water hyacinth in the lake is affecting the beauty of this water body to a big extent, besides preventing the people enjoying the pleasure boating from covering the entire lake.A large number of young and old vie with each other in taking selfie pictures on the bank of the lake on the road leading from Hotel Tamil Nadu to Anna Park Junction. They complain about the foul odour emanating from this weed.A cross-section of the tourists and also the local environmental activists demand the district administration to take steps for the removal of water hyacinth from the lake water at regular intervals.A few of the motor fitted boats were sent to Chennai city in the rescue operations during the recent floods. These boats have suffered damages due to overuse.The tourists demand the Tourism Development Corporation to repair and renovate these boats and put them for public use immediately.
