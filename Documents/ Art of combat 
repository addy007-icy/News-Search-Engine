The Government College for Women auditorium at Vazhuthacaud resembled a ‘kalari’ (or combat arena) on Saturday.Dressed in traditional white loincloths with the ‘thalekettu’ (head gear), students brandished fake swords and shields as they readied themselves to perform for the ‘Parichamuttukali’ competition in the high school level.The martial art-dance form, which continues to be practised by Syrian Christians, is believed to have had its origin as a religious offering and has gradually come to be viewed as an entertainment art. Dancing in a circle, the performers strike using their swords and defend with their shields in actions that strongly resemble those of the martial art ‘Kalaripayattu’. They dance to songs that narrate the stories of the St. Thomas, one of the 12 Apostles, and certain legends of the Holy Bible.Similar to the traditional art form of ‘Margamkali’, a ‘Parichamuttukali’ performance gets under way with the ‘Vandana Ganam’ to seek divine blessings.According to Manarcaud Kunjappan, an ‘Asan’ (or teacher), who has been training students for 22 years, the art form did not stick to a rigid pattern and has been evolving over the years. The performances of the students were evaluated on various parameters including their ability to sustain the tempo and energy in the art form that required immense stamina. The rhythmic movements and the contact between the swords and the shields also was a key component of the dance form. The team representing the B.S.S. Gurukulam Higher Secondary School, Alathur, came first in the competition. CSI EMHSS, Attingal, and St. Mary’s HSS, Kidangoor, were the first and second runners-up.
