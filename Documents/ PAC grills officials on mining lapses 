Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) Chairman Bhuma Nagi Reddy on Thursday said the PAC would come out with a comprehensive report to safeguard the State's revenue and correct the deficiencies.The first PAC after the State’s bifurcation is on the job of identifying the loopholes in the functioning of Mining Department and submit a report to the Assembly, suggesting corrective measures, he told he media here.Mr. Nagi Reddy and other PAC members A. Suresh, P.G.V.R.Naidu and P. Vishnumar Raju grilled the mining and revenue officials on the mining activity of black galaxy granite in Chimakurthy of Prakasam district based on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) which was placed in the Assembly recently.The PAC wanted to know as to how the mining activity was allowed in the vicinity of Ramatheertham reservoir in violation of the Supreme Court’s guidelines restricting mining near drinking water sources, residential areas and localities close to national and State highways.“If the government is not following the rules, how can it expect the people to abide by the same?,” he asked and termed such activity as ‘contempt of court’.Waving a copy of the land record downloaded from the Mee Bhoomi portal, he questioned as to how the revenue officials had allowed mining in a land coming under non-existent survey number. He wanted to know whether the No Objection Certificate(NOC) had been obtained by the firm concerned from the district administration for the purpose.It may be noted that the CAG had pointed out instances of non-compliance with provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act issued by the Union and State governments, particularly with regard to grant, transfer and renewal of leases and deficiencies in-operation of mining leases as well as monitoring by the department.What the CAG report saysDelays in disposal of applications seeking mineral concessionLeases granted without obtaining mining plansMining rights transferred without consent of govt.Non-working leases not lapsed even after expiry ofstipulated idle periodWith no prescribed time limit in rules, applicationsneither considered for renewal nor rejection
