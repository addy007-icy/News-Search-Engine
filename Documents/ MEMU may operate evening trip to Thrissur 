It is too premature to comment on this,” he said.Around 100 officials from various railway divisions take part in the three-day timetable conference and decide on the feasibility of extending trains and introducing new ones.“It is a complicated task since free track timings must be identified, while taking care not to delay existing trains,” Railway sources said.Diesel engineOn making available a diesel engine to extend the MEMU to Harbour Terminus and Old Railway Station (ORS), Mr. Bajpai said it could be arranged once amenities at the Harbour Terminus are ready.
