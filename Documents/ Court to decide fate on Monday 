The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s odd-even rule will continue at least till Monday, when the Delhi High Court pronounces its order on a batch of writ petitions challenging the December 28 notification for the scheme.As a Division Bench concluded the hearing on the public interest petitions, the government claimed in the court that the per capita toxic gas emission had reduced in the Capital as a result of fewer four-wheelers on the roads and the pollution levels had gone down in the eight days since the rule was enforced.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Delhi government, affirmed before the Bench, comprising Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, that the peak pollution in the city had been recorded at its lowest level since the scheme was launched.Since the pollution level had shown a consistently declining trend, especially during the peak traffic hours, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for the National Capital Region opined that the Delhi government must be permitted to continue with the odd-even scheme beyond the originally stipulated 15 days, said Mr. Salve.Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai, Delhi Dialogue Commission vice-chairman Ashish Khetan and Centre for Science and Environment Director-General Sunita Narain were present in the court.Before the court reserved its order for January 11, Mr. Salve said the vehicle rationing scheme had been implemented as an “emergency measure” to arrest the high peak when the overall pollution levels were five to six times higher than the standards.“This is urgently required to protect public health in a city where every third child has impaired lungs,” said Mr. Salve, while placing before the court a report prepared by the Environment Pollution Authority. He said since the Delhi government was duty-bound to control pollution, a wrong law cited by the petitioners would not invalidate its notification.
