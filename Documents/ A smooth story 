VEGETABLE GALAVAT KABABFlavoured with hot spices and peppercorns, the delicious Lakhnawi vegetable galavat kabab has been cooked in a way that they taste like mutton galavat kababs. The dish can be paired with sheermal (golden dough made of flour, milk, ghee & saffron), which is another speciality of Lucknow.Ingredients200 gms of cubed jackfruit100 gms paneer mashed1/2 cup of Bengal gram lentils/100 gms hung curd50 gms chana daal soaked in water1tsp oil5-6 green chillies (mine were not very spicy)4-5 garlic cloves1-1/2 piece ginger1 tsp freshly pounded cardamom powder1/2 tsp garam masala1-1/2 tsp red chilli powder3 cloves for smoking the mixtureSalt to tasteMore oil for shallow fryingMethodAdd jackfruit and lentils to pressure cooker and cook for 3 whistles. Wait till the pressure settles down. Cook on low flame for 15-20 minutes until water gets completely absorbed. In a pan, add teaspoon of oil and fry green chillies, garlic and ginger. Grind these upon cooling. Grind cooked jack fruit and lentils to thick paste. Add mashed paneer and hung curd. Add ginger-garlic-chilli paste to this along with cardamom powder, garam masala and red chilli powder. Grind until smooth. Burn cloves and smoke the mixture with it to attain smoky flavour. If you feel the mixture is hard, add water to soften it. Season with salt. Combine and divide the mixture into 28 equal portions. Flatten and shape them into a patty.Add 2 tbsp. of oil to a non-stick pan and place 4-5 patties depending on size of the pan. By gently flipping, cook on medium flame until they turn nice brown on both the sides. Carefully handle while flipping as these kababs are remarkably soft and get broken easily. Serve hot with mint and coriander chutney mixed with curds, sliced roundels of onion mixed with red chillies and garam masala and lemon slice.
