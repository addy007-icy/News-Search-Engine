East Delhi Mayor Harshdeep Malhotra has urged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to implement the 4th Delhi Finance Commission recommendations and transfer funds to the cash-starved corporation to help it tide over financial crisis and pay salaries to the employees.In his letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Malhotra said the Corporation required Rs. 1,525 crore for payment of salaries to municipal employees, including 60 per cent sanitation workers who have not been paid since October 2015. The Corporation has also not paid pension to its staff for the past five months, Mr. Malhotra said adding that the government will be “responsible” for any “untoward incident” arising out of non-payment of dues to municipal employees.“The human and social dimensions of non-payment of salary are now impacting core municipal functions of sanitation, primary health and primary education which would have far reaching consequences,” Mr Malhotra said. “If due to non-payment of salary any mishap occurs, Delhi government will be responsible,” he warned.The Mayor said that the onus of implementing the recommendations of 4th Delhi Finance Commission lies with Delhi government which has been delaying it by passing the buck to the Union government. The finance commission had recommended various steps to improve the financial health of the civic bodies and also gave some suggestions to the Centre.
