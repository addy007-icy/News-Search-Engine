Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has demanded SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan’s views on the legal measures taken by the Central government and the BJP to block reservation in bank promotions. In a statement here on Sunday, Mr. Achuthanandan pointed out that the Supreme Court had decided against reservation in bank promotions based on the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi’s contentions in a review petition against the judgment of the Madras High Court. The Supreme Court had done so overturning its early stand in favour of reservation in bank promotions. The AG’s stand reflected the BJP government’s opposition to reservation, which was the stand of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Why should Mr. Natesan stand by the BJP despite all this if it were not to serve his vested interests, Mr. Achuthanandan asked.
