The Telangana Telugu Desam Party has charged the ruling TRS with violating the constitutional provisions in the run up to the elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).The TRS, the TTDP alleged, indulged in several irregularities, including the removal of names of eligible voters from the voters’ lists, reorganisation of divisions, changes in the reservation pattern and the latest being the unilateral change in election schedule.The ruling party’s hoardings and posters were seen everywhere across the GHMC area and the party was not allowing the opposition parties to conduct their campaign for the polls.In a complaint to the State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy, TTDP president L. Ramana urged the election authority to check the irregularities resorted to by the ruling party. Meanwhile, Telangana YSR Congress president Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy said that the party will go it alone in the polls.“We expected that the government will give us three to four days to file objections to reservation of wards. But, simultaneous announcement of reservation and schedule was unprecedented,” he said.TRS has removed names of eligible voters from the voters’ lists, reorganised divisions, changed the reservation pattern and now has made unilateral changes in election schedule– L. Ramana, TTDP president
