The inaugural function of the 103rd Indian Science Congress also saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi release a souvenir of the abstracts of the plenary sessions at the open air theatre at Manasagangothri here.Only, the book’s cover page bore a glaring printing mistake that few could notice.Though the congress was being held in 2016, the cover page had mistakenly printed the year as 2015.“103rd Indian Science Congress 3-7 January, 2015, Mysuru,” said the title of the book containing the abstracts of the plenary sessions.Few could notice when the Prime Minister and other dignitaries posed with the book after it was released at the inaugural function. The printing error was noticed only after it was distributed.
