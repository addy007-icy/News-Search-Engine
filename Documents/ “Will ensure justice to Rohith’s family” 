Chowdary on Saturday said the Centre would ensure justice to the student’s family.The Centre ordered a judicial probe to fix responsibility, he said, adding that “we will take care of the bereaved family.”Talking to reporters here, he decried politicisation of the higher education system and this was affecting the atmosphere on the college campuses and the future of the students who should be busy concentrating on their studies.On the arrest of MP P.V. Midhun Reddy and MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, he denied the YSRC charge that the TDP was foisting cases on YSRC leaders.
