Attacking the government over the suicide of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Tuesday charged that the Vice-Chancellors had been handpicked by BJP-RSS and asked student wings to come together to fight the “communal forces“.“This is only a beginning. Vice Chancellors have been handpicked by BJP-RSS. They would be interested to promote ABVP rather than academics. All Student Wings must come together to fight communal forces on the Campus”, the party general secretary said in a series of tweets.He alleged that the suicide by Rohith Vemula reflected the mindset of the BJP against dalits.“Dalit students were protesting against an abusive posting against Dalit students on social media by a ABVP activist. Even after they were found not guilty by the Enquiry Committee... Partisan attitude of V-C and Minister Bandaru Dattatreya led to expulsion of Dalit Students,” Singh, who is in charge of party affairs in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, said.The University of Hyderabad campus on Monday witnessed widespread protests after the Dalit student’s body was found hanging in a hostel room on Sunday.
