Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki called this Republic Day a “sad day” for Indian democracy, after President’s rule was imposed in the State. “It was expected, but is still the result of a political conspiracy,” he told The Hindu. “The [President’s] decision is not wise for the people of Arunachal Pradesh.”Reacting to Governor J.P. Rajkhowa’s charge that with the Congress in power, a law and order crisis loomed large, he said: “Show me one place where violence has taken place. You won’t find a single mosquito killed under my watch.”Mr. Tuki consulted Kapil Sibal for Wednesday’s hearing in the Supreme Court on the Centre’s recommendation.Asked why he did not hold an Assembly session for six months, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Nabam Tuki said on Tuesday that the suspension happened because it was sub judice. “Another single Bench bracketed a court order that had allowed us to hold the session. So we were bound by the order,” he said.Mr. Tuki insisted that the imposition of President’s rule was uncalled for. “There is no point in imposing President’s rule. It is an elected government and we have a majority.”He said the party would try its best to get out of the political quagmire and fight the Centre’s decision legally.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal was consulted by Mr. Tuki for Wednesday’s hearing in the Supreme Court on the Centre’s recommendation to bring the State under President’s Rule.
