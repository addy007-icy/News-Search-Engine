Peddapuram DSP S. Rajasekhar on Thursday said they have not imposed any ban or any restriction to conduct “Kapu Ikya Garjana” on January 31 at Tuni as it was stated by former Minister Mudragada Padmanabham.It has to be recalled that Mr. Mudragada wrote a letter to the Chief Minister taking serious objection over the imposing Section 30 in the district.The DSP, who met Mr. Padmanabham in Kirlampudi last evening, told him that Section 30 of Police Act was imposed in view of cock fights and not with an intention to block the public meeting in Tuni. He said that they also assured the former minister that the police will assist in regulating the traffic en-route Tuni on that day.
