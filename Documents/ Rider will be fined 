The onus on the two-wheeler rider has gone up with the new helmet rule.“The rule clearly stipulates that if the pillion rider fails to wear helmet, the person riding the vehicle will be fined since he or she is the one who will be carrying the pillion on their vehicle,” said N.D. Birje, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic).Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Birje said the rider has to be more watchful henceforth since if anything untoward happens to the pillion rider for not wearing a helmet, the rider would be held responsible. Mr. Birje said: “If anybody asks for a lift, they too will have to carry a helmet for the ride.”
