Members of Tamil Nadu Vannar Peravai, Tamil Nadu Maruthuvar Sangam and Adi Tamizhar Peravai submitted a petition at the Collector’s office here on Monday, condemning the recently released Tamil movie ‘Kathakali’ as “it contained dialogues offensive to certain castes”.They alleged that there was a scene in the movie in which the man playing the role of antagonist said that the oppressed communities should continue to do their hereditary professions.R. Selvam from Adi Tamizhar Peravai said, “The villain says that a cobbler’s son should remain a cobbler, a washerman’s son should remain a washerman and a barber’s son should remain a barber. This amounts to the moviemaker saying that the oppressed castes should not come up in life.”They later raised slogans against the director, Pandiraj, and its lead actor, Vishal.M.S. Ravichandran of Tamil Nadu Vannar Peravai said that the makers of the movie should immediately remove the offensive dialogues.“Our protest will otherwise be carried out on a larger scale,” he said.
