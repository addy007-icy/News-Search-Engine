A Delhi court has sentenced a man to three years rigorous imprisonment for thrashing a thief to death, rejecting his defence that a group of people had beat the thief to death.The deceased thief had taken away mobile phones and Rs. 1,500 from convict Raj Kumar’s residence in north Delhi’s Kirari in July last year. According to the Judge, the convict had “every reason to protect his property, but he should not have exceeded the right of private defence to such unjustifiable extent”.The court held the accused guilty after the doctor who conducted the post-mortem said that only two external injuries were visible on the victim’s body, belying the convict’s submission that the crowd which gathered outside his house had beaten the thief to death.Further, there was a delay of about three hours before the accused informed the police about the incident“Convict Raj Kumar is… sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and fined Rs. 1 lakh. In case the fine of Rs. 1 lakh is realised, the entire amount would go to the legal heirs of the deceased after the expiry of period of appeal or as per the outcome of such appeal, if any,” the Judge added.
