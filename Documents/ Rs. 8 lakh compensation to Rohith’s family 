The University of Hyderabad has announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 8 lakh to the bereaved family of Rohith Vemula, who committed suicide on the campus on January 17 that created a nationwide furore.The Demand Draft will be handed over to his mother, Radhika, by a team of university officials, a statement from the university said.Officials, however, maintained that it has been a practice for the last few years.In 2013 too, the university responded similarly when Madari Venkatesh, a Dalit PhD scholar from Advanced Centre for Research in High Energy Materials (ACRHEM) ended his life by consuming poison.The decision to provide financial assistance to the family was taken after a committee headed by Prof V. Krishna recommended reforms and measures to make the campus a more inclusive and rewarding experience for students from these communities.An official revealed that financial assistance was also provided in earlier cases related to suicides on campus, after the students went on protests against the administration.However, the quantum of ‘compensation’ was less.
