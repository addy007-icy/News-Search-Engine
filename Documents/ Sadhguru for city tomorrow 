Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev’s maiden visit to the city has caught the attention of a large number of people and so far some 6,000 persons have registered to attend the programme scheduled on Tuesday.‘An Evening with Sadhguru’ organised by Isha Foundation would feature an insightful discourse, meditation and a question-answer session apart from a performance by Sounds of Isha, Isha Foundation’s band of musicians.The organisers initially expected a turnout of around 3,000 interested persons. “The response has been overwhelming,” a volunteer said. They are planning to close the registration by Monday itself.Sadhguru’s programme in Hyderabad was a tremendous success with people packing up the venue that had a capacity to seat 4,000 persons, a volunteer said.The volunteers of the Isha Foundation are working round the clock making the arrangements at the Port Stadium.Sadhguru has a unique ability to make the ancient yogic sciences relevant to contemporary minds, acting as a bridge to deeper dimensions of life. His approach does not ascribe to any belief system, but offers methods for self-transformation, Maa Naanaki of Isha Foundation said.Isha has over 200 centres worldwide.
