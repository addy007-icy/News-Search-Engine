A sustainable recovery in the Indian economy remains elusive with industrial output shrinking by 3.2 per cent in November 2015, marking its worst performance since October 2011, while consumer price inflation inched up to 5.6 per cent in December.The dichotomy of rising inflation accompanying a decline in industrial output poses a fresh problem to the government of how to spur domestic demand, say experts. The spike in retail inflation makes it difficult for the RBI to cut interest rates to spur investments, while cramping the Centre’s ability to use fiscal fillip to prop up the economy. “This poses a dilemma for the government on how to boost domestic demand. With inflation going up, the Centre cannot expect an accommodation from monetary authorities,” D.K. Srivastava, Chief Policy Adviser, EY India, told The Hindu.
