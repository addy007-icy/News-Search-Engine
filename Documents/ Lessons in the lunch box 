It is also convenient for working parents. All we can do is advise parents. We plan to conduct workshops for them,” he said. While most parents have welcomed the move, many are struggling to find alternatives. Sindhu H.D., whose daughter studies in BGS National Public School, said she is trying to replace snacks with vegetable salads, fruits and fresh fruit juices. Another parent, Latha Rao, wants schools to be lenient on some days. “While we all realise the need for our children to consume healthy food, schools should allow students to eat junk food once a week so that they do not crave for it. It may be difficult for working parents to pack full meals on all days of the week,” she said.
