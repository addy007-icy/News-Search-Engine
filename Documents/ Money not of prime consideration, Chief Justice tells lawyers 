A legal practitionerâ€™s ultimate duty is to assist the process of administration of justice, and money is not of prime consideration, Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur has said. He was inaugurating the administrative block and library of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS) here on Saturday.He said legal practice had become a lucrative field now and legal practitioners often earned more than their counterparts in other professions. However, true satisfaction in the profession must come from the way one handles the process of administering justice, he said. The Chief Justice also called on the community of legal practitioners to turn India into a hub of legal education in Asia. He pointed to the number of persons of Indian origin who studied and taught at renowned law schools in the United States and in the United Kingdom.An institution is not know for its brick and mortar works but for the minds that lead them and their scholarship, he added, pointing out that the state of legal education in the country needed to improve. Around 60,000 lawyers come out every year from the 1,300 law schools in the country. Academic conditions in many of them leave much to be desired for, said Justice Thakur.Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who delivered a special address, praised the facilities at NUALS.
