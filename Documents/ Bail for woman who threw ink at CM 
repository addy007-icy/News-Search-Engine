A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to Bhawna Arora, who was charged with throwing ink at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during an event organised to celebrate the ‘success’ of the odd-even scheme at Chhatrasal Stadium last week.Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Kumar Aggarwal granted her bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 with one surety of a like amount.The court, meanwhile, pulled up the Delhi Police for the security lapse. Throwing ink at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was a clear-cut case of security lapse, the court said.“One may imagine what would have been the situation in case, god forbid, the bottle could have contained some corrosive substance like acid mixed with ink,” the court observed.“If the Chief Minister of Delhi is not safe, one may wonder what will be the fate of the ordinary citizens,” the court mused.
