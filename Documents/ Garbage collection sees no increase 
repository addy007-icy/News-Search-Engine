The amount of garbage collected every day in South Delhi on an average has not increased since the Swachh Bharat Mission was launched in October 2014, contrary to claims by the local municipality.The BJP-led South Delhi Municipal Corporation has said on numerous occasions, via its leaders and officials, that garbage collection had gone up after the Centre’s initiative to clean the country started. In fact, SDMC Commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel said in his Budget speech for 2016-2017 presented last month that collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) had gone up from a daily average of 2,400-2,500 metric tonnes to 2,900-3,000 MT.But, according to a report by officials of the Okhla sanitary landfill site, where South Delhi's trash ends up, the average daily collection from October 2013 to November 2015 has been 2,435.172 MT. This report was in response to a query by SDMC Leader of Opposition Farhad Suri, who said on Tuesday that the civic body had tried to inflate its data.“The figures given by the corporation are incorrect. The Corporation has failed to improve sanitation services. The contract for private garbage collection companies expired almost a year and a half ago. No new concessionaire has been enrolled,” said Mr. Suri.According to the SLF report, a total of 19.40 lakh metric tonnes of MSW was lifted between October 2013 to November 2015, with the highest daily average being in October 2015 at 3,061 MT. This was due to a special sanitation drive
