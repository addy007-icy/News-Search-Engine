The 64-day-long annual Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season at Sabarimala drew to a close with the ritualistic Guruti at Malikappuram on Wednesday evening. However, there was no let up in the flow of pilgrims to the holy hillock. Tantri Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu, assisted by Melsanthi E.S. Sankaran Namboodiri, performed Padi puja at the holy steps immediately after the Pushpabhishekom ritual in the evening. Ashtabhishekom and Udayasthamana puja were the other important rituals performed on Wednesday. The Ayyappa temple was closed after Athazha puja. The Melsanthi closed the sanctum sanctorum singing Harivarasanam. â€” Special Correspondent
