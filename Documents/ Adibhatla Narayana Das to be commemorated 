: The Srimadajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasa Katha Gana Kala Parishat is organising a three-day celebrations to commemorate Adibhatla Narayana Das. The celebrations will commence on January 20 in Guntur.The highlight of the celebrations will be a rendition of Narayana Das’ ‘Dasa vidha raga navati kusuma manjari’ by Prof. Srikantham Nagendra Shastry of Bengaluru on January 21.“The ‘Manjari’ is a ragamalika comprising 90 Carnatic ragas. The first half of the agamalika is in Sanskrit and the second half in Telugu with the ragas arranged in the inverse order.The vocalist sings the ragamalika to synchronise it with five eka-jati talas beat with the hands, the thighs or feet and the head. A performance of this nature had never been attempted after Pandit Narayana Das in 1933,” said one of the organisers.It is difficult to find a parallel for Pandit Srimadajjada Adibhatla Narayana Das (1864-1945). He was the only scholar who had mastery over four classical languages (Sanskrit, Telugu, Arabic and Persian) and translated from Persian and English into Sanskrit and Telugu; the only litterateur who wrote a comparative treatise on the works of Kalidas and Shakespeare; the only writer-composer who translated into Telugu and set to music Rig Vedic hymns and the only writer-composer who composed a geeta-malika comprising 90 Carnatic ragas.The three-day celebrations will commenceon January 20 in Guntur
