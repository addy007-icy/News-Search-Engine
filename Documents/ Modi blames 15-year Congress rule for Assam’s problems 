Don’t you think it’s unfair to me,” Mr. Modi said.“They are asking questions about my government. But what have you done in last 15 years in Assam and 10 years in the Centre when a person representing Assam was the Prime Minister,” he said, referring to Dr. Singh.“They are just trying to confuse the people. You compare their 15-year rule and my 15-month-old government. You will see the vast difference,” he said.Tribal status for Karbis, BodosMr. Modi announced that the people of Karbi community living in the plains of Assam and Bodos living in hill areas would be granted tribal status and the process has already started.“Development is the only solution to all problems of the area and I have opened both my heart and hand to ensure that the dreams and aspiration of the people of the area, which the State government has failed to fulfil, are realised,” Modi said.The Prime Minister said he had instructed that youths from the northeast should be recruited in the Delhi Police and the process has already begun.Announcing other initiatives, the Prime Minister said a central technical institute located in Kokrajhar would be given the status of a deemed university, the Sealdah-Guwahati Kanchenjunga Express will be extended up to the Barak Valley while the Rupsi Airport in Dhubri will be taken over by the Indian Air Force.
