The Sri Lanka Navy has suspended former Lt. Yoshitha Rajapaksa — the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and who is now under arrest — from its service with effect from last Sunday (February 28). This was in response to a request made by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to the Ministry of Defence to take action against Yoshita “in order to keep the ongoing FCID investigations independent, as currently charges are being framed in the courts”, an official release stated.A month ago, Yoshitha had been arrested along with four others in a money laundering case.
