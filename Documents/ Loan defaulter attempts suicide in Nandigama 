A woman Sirisha, allegedly attempted suicide on Saturday by consuming sleeping pills, unable to repay the loan she had borrowed from a private money lender.She was admitted to a private hospital and her condition is stated to be stable, said Nandigama Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) T. Radesh Murali. Ms. Sirisha had borrowed Rs. 1.8 lakh from one Durga Rao in 2007. However, she could not repay the loan and failed to pay the interest for the principal amount too.In December last year, the moneylender filed a case in the court and submitted the promissory note signed by Ms. Sirisha. The court then gave order in favour of Durga Rao and directed Sirisha to pay Rs. 12 lakh to him.“The victim recently approached the police, alleging harassment from Durga Rao. During inquiry, police confirmed that there was no harassment from the moneylender and he proceeded legally for the recovery of the loan and no case has been registered,” the DSP said.Fearing that Durga Rao would attach the retirement benefits of her father, who is a government employee, Ms. Sirisha resorted to the extreme step, Mr. Murali said.
