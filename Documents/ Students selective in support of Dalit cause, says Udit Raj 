Bharatiya Janata Party’s Dalit face and Northwest Delhi’s MP Udit Raj on Sunday criticised the students agitating over the suicide of scholar Rohith Vemula for being “selective” in their support to the cause of the Dalits.Slamming the Opposition for “faking” solidarity, Mr. Raj alleged that they were trying to gain political mileage out of the issue.The MP, who is also the national chairman of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Organisations, questioned why it takes the death of a Dalit for people to express their outrage.Speaking to The Hindu , he said: “I am against this selective support of the students as well as the Opposition parties. The state of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh is the worst. Officials are being demoted all of a sudden for no reason and forget reservations, students fail to get a seat even if they make it through the general merit list. Why is nobody looking into those issues?”The MP demanded a thorough probe into the suicide of the Hyderabad University scholar.“A probe has been ordered and I will wait until the report comes,” he said when asked about the role of Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya.On Sunday, Mr. Raj had organised a national convention for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, where he announced the launch of a national membership drive. “Our aim is to cover 80 per cent of the 676 districts in India. The drive is aimed at creating a common forum for the SCs/STs of the country, where they can voice their aspirations, demands and suggestions.”The convention participants also demanded a committee at the joint secretary level to oversee the outlays planned under the Scheduled Caste Sub Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub Plan (TSP).
