A few weeks ago, a journalist of a prominent news channel mentioned in her blog about how she was sexually exploited first by a close relative when she was a minor and then by a close friend in her college days.Many women face sexual exploitation, be it rape, or sexual abuse, or molestation, very early in life.And, in a majority of the cases, it is the relatives or close friends who are responsible.Visakhapatnam is no different.It earned the dubious distinction of registering 86 cases of rape under IPC Section 376 in 2015.Crime against women, especially cases of rape and molestation, is on the rise in the city.In 2013, the number of rape cases reported was 66. In 2014, it increased to 84.The number of molestation cases reported in 2013 was 137. In 2014, it had gone up to 155. In 2015, the number further scaled up to 233.Crime against women has been on the rise across the country, and Andhra Pradesh is among the top five States witnessing the trend.As per the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) statistics, the total number of crime cases against women in 2013 was put at 2,95,930 and the share of the combined Andhra Pradesh was 32,809, accounting for 10.6 per cent of the total cases of crime.In 2014, the NCRB figure stood at 3,21,993, and Andhra Pradesh’s share (post bifurcation) was put at 16,512.The number of rape cases in 2013 in the country stood at 33,707, and the combined AP’s share was 1,635. In 2014, the figures were 36,500 and 962 (post bifurcation).Technical rapeThough the statistics look alarming, one thing that needs to be understood is that a majority of rape cases are termed “technical rape,” wherein one persuades the victim to indulge in the act in the garb of getting married, or exploitation of minors by close relatives or friends, says Commissioner of Police Amit Garg.In 2013, 39 cases of rape against minors were registered in the city. Out of them, 38 were committed by people known to the victims.In 2014, the total number of cases was 33 and all had been committed by known persons. In 2015 all, the 34 cases registered were against known persons or relatives.Coming to cases involving majors, all the 27 cases registered in 2013 were because of promise for marriage or by known persons.Similar was the case in 2014 (51cases) and 2015 (52 cases).As per the NCRB records, of the 962 cases reported in AP in 2014, 830 were committed by known persons, of whom 35 were family members, 61 relatives, 212 neighbours, and 522 known persons.Perverted mindset“Rape or exploitation by known persons is because of perverted mindset,” says HoD of Department of Psychology, GITAM University, Deepa Mohan.“Most of the cases go unreported due to fear and stigma factor. And this is taken as an advantage by the exploiters,” she said. Concurring with Dr. Deepa, M.V.R Raju of the Department of Psychology in Andhra University said that women, during adolescence, experience certain hormonal changes, which would impact them physically and mentally. Close friends of relatives take advantage of that change.“Degradation of family values and stimulant factors such as television and cinema are also responsible for the rising crime against women,” he pointed out.
