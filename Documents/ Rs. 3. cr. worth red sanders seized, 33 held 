The Nimmanapalle police on Saturday arrested three persons while they were trying to dispose of red sanders logs near the Bahuda project in Madanapalle division on Saturday.Speaking to reporters, Nimmanapalle Sub-Inspector Mr. Harihara Prasad said: “A couple of years ago, a landlord at Agraharam village had felled red sanders trees in his fields with the permission of the Forest Department and stocked them on the premises of his bungalow.“Over the years, during his absence, as he was away in Hyderabad, some miscreants took away several logs worth over Rs. 1 crore, leaving just 27 of them. Though he had tried to hand them over to forest officials, it did not materialise for various reasons.”He added that the landlord had kept the remaining logs in a safe corner of his bungalow on the advice of officials.ConspiracyMeanwhile, a tailor took advantage of the landowner’s prolonged absence from home and hatched a conspiracy with two others in Madanapalle town to sell off the logs.Subsequently, the trio shifted the logs to an isolated location near the Bahuda project. Acting on a tip-off, police rushed to the spot and seized the logs, besides arresting the trio.In another incident, a police team intercepted a truck and an SUV carrying red sanders at Settigunta near Railway Kodur in Kadapa district on Saturday morning and seized logs worth more than Rs. 2 crore.They also took around 30 woodcutters from Tamil Nadu from a nearby forest location into custody.
