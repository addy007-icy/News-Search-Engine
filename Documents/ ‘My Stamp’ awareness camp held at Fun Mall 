The Department of Posts organised a one-day ‘My Stamp’ awareness camp at Fun Republic Mall in the city, on Saturday. Fifteen persons (mostly children) took pictures and got stamps with their images on the spot. They paid Rs. 300 to get a set of 12 stamps with the value of Rs. 5 each. The department also created awareness on philately and some of the visitors to the mall opened accounts with the philately club.Rare miniature stamps were also sold during the four-hour event in the evening.In a similar camp at Brookefields Mall a couple of weeks ago, 35 persons got ‘My Stamps’ printed on the spot.More camps would be organised in the city to create awareness on ‘My Stamps’, a postal department official said.
