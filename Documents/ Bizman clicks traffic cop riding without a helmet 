At a time when the city police are encouraging citizens to capture and report violations through an app, a citizen was allegedly intimidated and harassed for photographing a traffic cop riding without a helmet.Goutham Jain, a cloth merchant, saw the traffic policeman riding a motorcycle without a helmet on Adugodi main road on Monday. He took a photograph with his phone camera.Trouble started when the constable Ramesh – who is attached to Koramangala traffic station – noticed Goutham clicking the picture. Ramesh allegedly approached Goutham and told him to delete the photograph. When Goutham refused, Ramesh snatched the bike key and fled. Curious onlookers, who noticed Ramesh's uncouth behaviour, staged an impromptu protest. Soon three patrolling vehicles reached the spot. They bundled the protestors, and took them to Koramangala traffic police station.The policemen threatened to book Goutham for public nuisance.Eventually, Goutham was forced to write an apology. The policemen returned the bike key only after deleting the picture from the mobile phone.Prima facie evidence indicates rude behaviour by the constableC.K. Baba,DCP (Traffic East)
