Seven years behind bars may be awaiting owners of pubs and bars where alcohol is served to those below the age of 18.The recently passed controversial Juvenile Justice Bill specifies in Section 78 that serving liquor to children is a punishable criminal offence with seven years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh.Welcoming the move that was based on his plea, Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the law establishes a strong deterrence, rather than just suspension of the licence.“I am convinced that only a strong deterrent such as criminal punishment will stop pubs and bars from serving liquor to children. Compliance and punishing violators will send a strong message,” he said.Excise Commissioner S.R. Umashankar said directions and circulars had been issued to department officials to tighten their vigil over underage drinking and minors in bars and pubs across the city. While, the MP has launched a email helpline (protectourchildren@rajeev.in); the Excise Department is conceptualising an initiative that seeks and accepts complaints from citizens through social media networks.However, officials candidly say that computerisation is yet to percolate to the department, and the initiative will take time to set up infrastructure and train manpower.
