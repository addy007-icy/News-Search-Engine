Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader B. Jayanti, daughter of V.P. Ramakrishna Pillai, veteran leader of the party and its former State secretary, has decided to quit the RSP and join the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Ms. Jayanti who was serving as the State secretary of the RSP’s feeder wing, Aikya Mahila Samajam and was the State committee member of the UTUC, told press persons in Kollam on Thursday that she was quitting the RSP in protest against the party coming under the autocratic grip of two or three leaders. “The decision to quit the RSP is one of the crucial decisions in my political life,” she said.While the RSP was with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) Ms. Jayanti had served as the vice president of the Kollam district panchayat. She said it hurt a lot to see that the ideologies of the party were now pawned before the interests of a few leaders.The only reason behind the party’s decision to sever ties with the LDF and join the United Democratic Front was to earn the Kollam Lok Sabha ticket. The paradox is that even as the national leadership of the party is still with the LDF the State unit of the party is succumbing to the vested interests of a few.She said she had not discussed her decision to quit the RSP with her father since it was her personal decision. The RSP was made to quit the LDF for the personal gains of a few.Fed up with what is happening in the party now, many of the cadres are now gearing up to leave the party, she said. She said she expects her decision to strengthen the party.Meanwhile, sources in the district unit of the CPI(M) said that the party has not taken any decision on the announcement made by Ms. Jayanti.However a formal announcement in this connection is likely to be made by the CPI(M) polit bureau member Pinarayi Vaijayan at a public meeting at Kundara near here on Friday which he will be addressing, party sources said.
