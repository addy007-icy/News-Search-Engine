Sanganna Karadi, MP, has asked officials to provide employment to people in need of jobs in the wake of the failure of the monsoon.Chairing a vigilance committee meeting here on Monday to review the implementation of Centrally sponsored schemes, he said that in view of the drought condition prevailing in the district, there were possibilities of people migrating to cities in search of jobs.Mr. Karadi urged the officials to prevent it by providing them employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and pay their wages expeditiously.R. Ramachandran, zilla panchayat chief executive officer, said that though there was a provision to provide employment through converging various schemes undertaken by government departments, the target was not being achieved due to lack of interest on the part of the officials.Mr. Karadi, while expressing his displeasure on seeing that over 20 district-level officials had abstained from the meeting, directed to issue notices to them and seek clarification.He also underlined the need for procuring fodder for the cattle by setting up a fund for the purpose. M. Kanagavalli, Deputy Commissioner, said that keeping in view the possible shortage of fodder in 11 hoblies, steps had been initiated to set up fodder banks in eight places and invite tenders for procurement of fodder.Mr. Karadi criticised officials for not evincing interest in preserving the materials already procured for setting up goshalas.Shoba Nagari, Satyanarayan Deshpande, both members and other officials were present.
