In a significant development in the spurious liquor case, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the matter found that the liquor which caused the death of five persons in Swarna Bar and Restaurant, was not adulterated there.According to police sources, some poisonous substance was mixed in the liquor which was served to the customers on December 7 in the bar and the employees were not aware of what it was and how much quantity of it was blended with the liquor.“The owners will keep some loose bottles under the tables (at the cash counter) separately and the other stocks will be kept inside the bar. We should not touch the stocks stored in the cartons. We do now what was mixed in the liquor we served to the customers,” said a person who was arrested by the police.Police are trying to find out whether any cheap liquor manufactured locally was served or the bar owners mixed poisonous material for giving extra kick to the victims. The family members, who were questioned by the SIT, feigned ignorance and blamed Malladi Vishnu for the tragedy.The Congress leader used the family members for running the business and tarnished the family’s image, the other accused in the case said.Police, who arrested Malladi brothers on Thursday night, said that the accused were not cooperating with the investigation and threatening the witnesses in the case.“We noticed several irregularities in the liquor business and the former MLA’s culpability was identified in the spurious liquor case. If Vishnu was not at fault why he escaped for about 20 days,” questioned a police officer.
