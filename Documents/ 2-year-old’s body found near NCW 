The decomposed body of a two-year-old girl was found dumped near the National Commission for Women (NCW) office at ITO, a few hundred metres from the Delhi Police Headquarters here, on Monday morning.The identity of the victim or the cause of death remains unclear, said the police. The body was first spotted around 11.45 a.m. by video-journalist Umesh Papnai, who had gone to the NCW office for a reporting assignment. However, as soon as he left the office, he noticed some stray dogs eating the body.Mr. Papnai called the police control room but the operator, according to him, did not seem to believe the story. The police reached the spot 20 minutes after the call was made and took the body to the mortuary of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital.“Prima facie it appears the death took place a few days ago. If autopsy shows it was an unnatural death, we will probe the murder angle. If not, we would trace those who dumped her and book them under appropriate provisions,” said a senior police officer.
