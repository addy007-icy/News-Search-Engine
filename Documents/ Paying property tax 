I entered into purchase and construction agreement with a builder for a flat in 2013.The flat was given to me in July 2015. The builder had paid property tax on my behalf for 2013-14 and recovered it from me. Should my liability to pay property tax commence from July 2015 (when the builder handed over the flat)?ChennaiThe recitals of your agreement will have to be looked into to ascertain whether the liability to pay property tax rests with you or the builder prior to handing over of possession of the flat.In general, assessment of property tax and your duty to pay the same need not necessarily commence from the date of handing over possession.Since the flat is owned by you, the tax has to be borne by you.
