Considering that Visakhapatnam Railway Station is an international ‘A’ grade station, it falls under the ISS (Integrated Security System).As per the ISS norms, the entire station should come under a CC TV camera umbrella. The minimum requirement of 120 cameras should be taken care of. The four unauthorised entry points should be closed. Right now anybody can access the station with any form of baggage from these unauthorised entry point, said a senior RPF officer. The seven out-dated DFMD’s (door frame metal detectors) at the access points should be replaced by the latest version that has inbuilt scanners.The station should be equipped with at least two under-vehicle scanners, with one each at the two major vehicle entry points. The RPF should have its own bomb squad and the present dog squad should be enhanced to at least six canines from two, since Visakhapatnam is divisional headquarters. Most importantly, the strength of RPF has to be enhanced, said a RPF officer.
