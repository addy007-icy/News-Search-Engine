“Celebrating a water body” is the theme for Perungudi Lake Festival on January 26. As a precursor to the event, competitions such as photography, painting, essay writing, poem and elocution are being conducted for school students. For instance, in paintings children need to submit their works showcasing the Perungudi lake scenery, wildlife or futuristic imagination of the lake.In another event for students of class XI and above, the organisers are asking for a master plan of the Perungudi lake. “It could be a write-up or a pictorial representation on their vision to maintain the lake. We have coordinators visiting schools and apartment complexes handing out entries for children to participate,” says Captain Selvakumar Royan.Apart from theme-based cultural activities and graffiti artistes, an exhibition of paintings and photos will also be on display around the lake on January 26. Last date for registration is January 18.For details, call Selvakumar (98401 59317), Sriram (9940674372)
