Slamming the Samajwadi Party government over law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, the BSP president Mayawati on oday said the ruling party has realised that it is not going to come back to power in the state.“The law and order situation has been bad since the very beginning...Samajwadi Party too has now realised that it is not coming back to power in the state and so their men, at every level, are looting and minting money instead of doing something for the people,” Ms. Mayawati told newspersons here.“This has led to further deterioration in the law and order situation... Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh has publicly accepted that his leaders are indulging in ‘loot’,” she said.“Out of love for his son, he has however not said anything directly about the chief minister but the SP chief considers that entire government is involved in corruption,” Ms. Mayawati said, adding it is due to pressure of the people that he has been forced to accept this.The position of BJP and the central government too is not good and so with the Assembly elections drawing closer in Uttar Pradesh, both these parties will convince to overcome their shortcomings and divert public attention by giving a communal colour to the elections, she said.Asking people of the state and the country to be wary of BJP and SP, Ms. Mayawati said: “Congress which has been on oxygen in U.P. since long is trying its hand at dramatics by making its yuvraj do padyatra and making him have lunch at the house of poor and Dalits by themselves providing food.”
