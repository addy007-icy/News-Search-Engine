Suicide by the scholar from the University of Hyderabad, Rohith Vemula, raises questions about the health of the whole society, and the Congress party does not intend to politicise the issue, said the TPCC working president Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, speaking at the ‘meet the press’ event organised by Telangana State Union of Working Journalists here on Wednesday.“Our vice-president, Rahul Gandhi, made it abundantly clear that he was not here to politicise the issue. It pertains to the whole society and especially the youth,” Mr. Vikramarka said, answering a question on the criticism.Answering another question suggesting the Congress’ bleak chances of winning, he said all the other parties had a tacit understanding among themselves which was visible in their response to Rohith’s death.Despite the promise of ‘Samajika Telangana’, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has not gone to the university so far, he criticised.Responding to Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s comments against him and TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, he called the former a “joker” who is making himself the laughing stock.The credit for the ‘global’ image of the city solely belongs to Congress party which has improved the infrastructure while maintaining the city’s cosmopolitan fibre, he claimed, while calling the MIM and the BJP as communal parties. TRS, with its obvious sectarian ideology, could damage the ‘global’ image of the city.Further, it has failed miserably in fulfilment of various promises during the last 18 months, Mr. Vikramarka said.Instead, the TRS is trying to ride on the achievements of the Congress party, such as Godavari pipelines, and Metro Rail.The TRS party has launched “political terrorism” by trying to poach from other parties using power and money, he alleged. He termed TDP as almost extinct in the Telangana State, hence, posed no threat.
