A frontline scientific demonstration project for cultivation of coconut is under way at seven selected panchayats across the State.The project is being taken up in the panchayats of Elakamon in Thiruvananthapuram, Kulasekharapuram in Kollam, Cherthala south in Alappuzha, Nedumpuram in Pathanamthitta, Kooroppada in Kottayam, Vellangallur in Thrissur and Parakkadavu in Kozhikode.Launched in 2015The project, launched in 2015, focuses on farmer-participatory strategies and is being undertaken in selected panchayats coming under the Keragramam scheme of the State government by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) through the Central Plantation Crop Research Institute, in association with Krishi Vignan Kendras.The implementation of the project, done in association with the Department of Agriculture, farmer organisations and local governments, aims at effective dissemination of technologies, according to B. Krishna Kumar, head, CPCRI centre, Kayamkulam.Earlier, a demonstration project was implemented in 1999-2003 in 25 hectares belonging to 208 farmers. As many as 5,000 palms were brought under the project. Adoption of management package had led to an increase in production, from 24 nuts to 46 nuts a palm a year, corresponding to 91.4 per cent yield improvement in root-wilt disease-prone coconut farms.Three high-yielding varieties of coconut have been released by the CPCRI for use in coconut farms in Kerala with a view to improving the income of farmers. The three varieties, namely Kalparaksha, Kalpasree and Kalpasankara, have been recommended for cultivation in root-wilt disease-endemic zones of the State. Over 38,000 quality seedlings of the three varieties have been distributed to farmers during the past seven years from the CPCRI regional centre at Kayamkulam.Root-wilt disease, a debilitating disease found in coconut farms, is managed through farm and palm hygiene, identification of disease-free mother palms and rejuvenation using disease-tolerant and disease-resistant coconut hybrids and varieties.The management techniques consist of strategies such as bio-priming of seedlings with bio-inoculation, liming of soil, soil-test-based fertilizer application, soil moisture conservation measures such as mulching, husk burial and management of leaf-rot using bio-agents.DAC-ELISA (Double Antibody Coated - Enzyme Linked Immonosorbent Assay) has been standardised for the screening of mother palms to ascertain on the disease status. The technique has been extensively utilised to identify mother palms for collection of seed nuts.
