The Kushala Nagar Geleyara Balaga, an association of friends residing in the Kushala Nagar extension at Sakleshpur, have criticised the Sakleshpur Town Municipal Council for its alleged failure to stop illegal construction there.Addressing a press conference at Sakleshpur on Friday, Gangaraj, president of the association, said that many influential people were constructing buildings in the town’s limits without adhering to building norms. Two people had constructed buildings in the Halesanthaveri Extension violating the rules. Another person had built a three-storied building in the backwaters area of Hemavati River. “There are many such buildings in Sakleshpur, which have been constructed without adhering to any of the norms. The officials concerned have failed to initiate any action against owners of such buildings to ensure a planned growth of the town,” he said.The officials were showing extra care on getting roadside petty shopkeepers vacated. However, they were not exhibiting same attention to illegal buildings. “An influential person has built a commercial complex near the old bus-stand, violating the building bylaws and by reducing the parking space along the road,” he alleged. Members of the association were present.
