In another green initiative, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started a drive of recycling waste paper from its offices.The DMRC on Sunday claimed that in the past five months, since the project took off, it has so far recycled over 8.80 tonnes of waste paper, which has resulted in saving considerable amount of power and water along with curtailing carbon emissions.“We had conducted a survey to gauge the results of this drive and it revealed that as much as 15.84 MW electricity was saved during this period. Similarly, water consumption avoided was 2200 KLD (kilo litres per day) while waste water generation resulted in savings of about 61.60 KLD,” said a DMRC official. Apart from this, adequate reduction in coal consumption, bamboo consumption was also recorded, he added.The DMRC had decided to recycle and re-use waste paper generated from the offices of the Delhi Metro in August last year.
