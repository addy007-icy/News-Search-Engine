Activists associated with the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO), the All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) and the All India Mahila Sanskritik Sanghathan (AIMSS) staged a demonstration outside the office of Deputy Commissioner here on Wednesday demanding the resignation of Union Minister for Human Resources Development Smriti Irani, Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya and University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao holding them responsible for the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit research scholar.They condemned the trio for allegedly acting at the behest of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and rusticating Dalit students who were associated with Ambedkar Students Association (ASA) from the hostel.“There were clashes between ABVP and ASA. An internal varsity committee had not held any particular persons responsible. Yet, Union Ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani, at the behest of ABVP, pressurised Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao and ensured that Dalit students were rusticated,” Channabasava Janekal, AIDYO district secretary, demanded.AIDSO district secretary Mahesh Cheekalaparvi demanded that the university authorities compensate the family of deceased and withdraw the rustication order .“Humiliation of Dalit students in university campuses is part of larger political scheme of suppressing dissent by force and imposing cultural singularism in the society. It is an attack on Indian constitution that upholds cultural diversities and cherishes equality,” Mahesh Cheekalaparvi, AIDSO leader said.Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) leader T.S Sunith Kumar, activists Chetana Banare and Aparna B.R. and others spoke. A memorandum, addressed to the President of India, was submitted to the office of Deputy Commissioner.
