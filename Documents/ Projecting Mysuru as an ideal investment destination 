The city’s image as an investment destination will be tested during ‘Invest Karnataka 2016’ to be held in Bengaluru next month.Though the 2010 and 2012 Global Investors’ Meet were a damp squib as far as Mysuru was concerned, a renewed effort will be made to highlight availability of land, water and cheap labour, besides reduced overhead costs to lure potential investors.This will be attractive for manufacturing units, which require reasonable amount of land and variable levels of skills of the labour force unlike highly qualified technical personnel required for IT and BT industries.Though land acquisition issues resulted in a few projects mooted during the Global Investors’ Meet 2012, as non-starters, the future looks bright for Mysuru as far as industries are concerned as land scarcity is not an issue anymore, according to stakeholders. For, the government has notified over 2,300 acres near Nanjangud (see related story) as an industrial estate.For genuine investors, Mysuru is ideal for investment in view of its climatic conditions, cheap labour, relatively lower rate of attrition, infrastructure, connectivity, and availability of water, all of which will be highlighted at the conference, according to Suresh Kumar Jain of the Mysore Industries Association.There is a general consensus that it is easy to recruit qualified entry-level workers given Mysuru’s network of educational institutions. Similarly, it is easier to secure qualified personnel at higher levels of administration as people past 50 years would look for a better quality of life in terms of peace and tranquillity and less chaos, which Mysuru offers in plenty.But the downside is that it is difficult to attract mid-level talent to run the show. For, opportunities are better in Bengaluru as also is the pay, says Sanjay Ahuja, a software entrepreneur. Very few industries in Mysuru can match the salaries offered in Bengaluru and hence, retaining mid-level talent is a challenge, according to Mr. Jain.On the positive side, the city has a well-developed service sector, including financial institutions, reputed educational institutions, avenues for entertainment to draw new talent while the overall quality of life and better infrastructure augurs well for the region’s industrial growth.
