Stakeholders of the jewellery sector – jewellery manufacturers, jewellers and goldsmiths – staged protests at four locations here on Monday demanding increase of ceiling for jewellery purchasers to share details of PAN card.B. Muthuvenkatraman, president of the Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association, says that from January 1 this year, customers purchasing jewellery for Rs. 2 lakh or more need to produce PAN details. Or, they need to fill up Form 60. It was common for customers to purchase jewellery for Rs. 2 lakh or more and there were several instances when family members pool in money to buy jewellery for weddings. It would not be possible for them to share details of PAN as the purchase was not by a single person. “It is difficult to implement this system,” he says.The Government had relaxed the norms for the real estate sector and said that for investments in real estate the PAN details should be shared for investments above Rs. 10 lakh. The ceiling should be increased to Rs. 10 lakh for jewellery customers too, he said.With Rs. 2 lakh as ceiling, it was possible for some jewellers to go in for unbilled sales. The sector was already experiencing the impact of the new system. Hence, the Government should increase the ceiling to Rs. 10 lakh, he said.The protests here were organised as part of the nation-wide protests.
