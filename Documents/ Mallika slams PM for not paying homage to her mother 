A day after legendary dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai passed away, her daughter Mallika Sarabhai, a bitter critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, slammed him for not paying homage to her mother.On Friday, Mallika Sarabhai noted that as Prime Minister of the country, he should have recognised the contribution of Mrinalini, a recipient of Padma Bhushan among other numerous awards and prizes.“My dear Prime Minister, you hate my politics and I hate yours. That has nothing to do with what Mrinalini Sarabhai did to promote the culture of this country to the world over sixty years,” she posted on her Facebook.“She blazed a trail for our culture to the world. That her death sees no word from you shows your mentality. However much you hate me, as our PM, it behoves you to recognise her contribution. You have not. Shame on you.”
