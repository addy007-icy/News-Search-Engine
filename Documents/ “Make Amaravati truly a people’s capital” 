The CPI(M) has said that the State government should take adequate initiatives to make Amaravarti a people’s capital in letter and spirit.The government’s policies give an impression that the new capital is turning into private capital with government according top priority to private and corporate entities.Unless the fruits of capital city reached every citizen, it would not become a people capital, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu said.He was addressing the CPI(M) CRDA region coordination committee meeting here on Thursday.Mr. Raghavulu said that the master plan was not beneficial to the farmers who parted with their lands. The government plans to hand over the lands pooled from the farmers to private companies. The farmers, who were feeling that they were deceived, were up in arms against the government, he said.The CRDA officials were unable to convince the farmers on the master plan, he added.The government was not transparent in its policies. On the one hand it was propagating green zone and on other it was extending the urban areas around the capital city. The farmers who were staunch followers of the Telugu Desam Party too were opposing the master plan proposals, he said.The govt. is not transparent in its policies. On one hand it is propagating green zone and on the other it is extending the urban areas around the capital city- B.V. Raghavulu,CPI(M) Polit Bureau member
