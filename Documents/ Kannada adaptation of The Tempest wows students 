Students rushed to the Zilla Rang Mandir to watch ‘Dham Dhoom Suntargali’, a Kannada adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Tempest , here on Wednesday.A team of artistes from Natana, founded by actor and theatre personality Mandya Ramesh, performed the play.The story is about a wizard who creates a tempest to lure his brother who had betrayed him and snatched his throne.Mantra Buddhi, the wizard uses magic to teach his brother and the King that replaced him, a lesson. Gali Kinnara, the spirit who works for the wizard also makes the Prince fall for the wizard’s daughter. The plot is peppered with comic characters and a talkative demon.The dance and fight sequences were modelled on Yakshagana and the music added to the ambience.Translator Vaidehi, (Janaki Srinivas Murthy), has ensured that the play retains the authentic Shakespearean elements of comedy, magic and romantic charm, while the plot is reconstructed in a Kannada environment. Her achievement lies in remodelling the play meant to be staged before a general audience for children and making it appropriate for youngsters by clever use of language.Director Jeevan Ram Sulya has used the sliced performance technique to show each shot as a complete unit, while being a part of the larger plot.The actors spoke different dialects of Kannada to distinguish the characters and their social background.The demon, with tribal roots, is unable to speak in the first few scenes, and speaks an unpolished dialect after being tutored by the wizard.Murali Shringeri as the wizard, Disha Ramesh as his daughter and Vinay as the demon stood out. Neenasam alumnus Sudarshan Ghale and team handled light and sound effectively. The Natana team presented four performances of the drama for school students over two days, as part of the Kalyana Ranga Torana theatre fest organised by the Ballari based group Ranga Torana.The same team of artists performed ‘Samsaradalli Sa Ni Da Pa’, an adaptation of The Virtuous Burglar by Italian playwright Dario Fo on Tuesday.
