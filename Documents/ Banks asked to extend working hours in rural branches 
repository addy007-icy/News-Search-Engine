In the wake of widespread drought and rural distress, the State government has told bankers to have their rural branches open early in the mornings to late in the evenings for providing credit services to small and marginal farmers. Customers are finding it difficult to visit banks during office hours as they have to go to their fields at that time.“Small and marginal farmers go to the fields when banks are open. And, they close when farmers return from work. I request you to change your working hours to ensure credit services to the poor,” Additional Chief Secretary and Development Commissioner Latha Krishna Rao said, while sharing her thoughts at the State credit seminar organised by NABARD here on Thursday.Banks function from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Besides other holidays, banks now remain open five days a week on the second and fourth weeks of every month. “You may like it [more holidays]. But, small and marginal farmers are not there when you open your offices,” Ms. Rao said.She urged them to respond to the seasonal vagaries and lend to consumption expenditure of farmers, particularly of dryland. “We need to introspect and see how the credit flow to rural areas is utilised.”The NABARD has estimated a credit potential of Rs.1,44,693.94 crore under the priority sector in Karnataka for 2016-17, an increase of 34 per cent over the credit potential for 2015-16.M.I.
