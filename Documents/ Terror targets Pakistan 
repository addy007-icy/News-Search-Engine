The terrorist attack at the elite Bacha Khan University near Peshawar that killed at least 20 people, including innocent students and teachers, is yet another gruesome incident that proves that Pakistan is fast slipping into the category of a ‘failed state’ (“Militants storm Pakistan university, kill at least 20,” Jan.21). Islamabad’s ‘bleed-India’ policy and continued denial of the existence of terror camps in its territory have cost it dear. Only last week, Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, in another inflammatory speech, had spoken about bombing India and Israel and targeting the Western countries. Pakistan needs to cooperate better with other nations in dealing with terror, lest it become another Afghanistan.S. S. Kaddargi,KalaburagiThe attack on the university campus carried out allegedly by the Pakistan Taliban proves that terrorism does not follow any religion but only believes in killing for the sake of killing. Pakistan, which was earlier harping on ‘good’ and ‘bad’ Taliban, must have now realised that in reality no such difference exists. Terrorism has to be fought by all civilised nations acting in tandem without any reservations based on religion or ideology.K.R. Jayaprakash Rao,Mysuru
