President Barack Obama reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the security of Asian allies in discussions with the leaders of South Korea and Japan about North Korea’s claim that it had tested a hydrogen bomb.The White House says Mr. Obama, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin—zoh ah—bay) agreed that North Korea’s actions “constitute yet another violation of its obligations and commitments under international law.”The statement released on Wednesday evening by the White House says Mr. Obama and the two leaders agreed to “work together to forge a united and strong international response” to North Korean threats.Pyongyang’s announcement of a successful hydrogen bomb test would mark a major and unanticipated advance for its still-limited nuclear arsenal.
