The Pachalam bridge which was sanctioned by the Railways over 16 years ago is a dream come true for thousands of people from the region who had to brave the elements and endure pollution as they waited at the railway level crossing.As was seen on Monday when the bridge was opened to traffic, the fear is rife that chaos will reign at junctions on either side of the bridge due to additional inflow of vehicles. “The western side on both junctions are too narrow and must be widened urgently by Kochi Corporation. A new bridge linking Chatiath Church and Pachalam Crematorium will considerably smoothern traffic in the region. People who are evicted can easily be rehabilitated in vacant land owned nearby by an oil major,” said A. P. Paul, vice president of SRM Cross Road Residents’ Association.The approach roads to Pachalam bridge too are narrow, mainly due to encroachments and haphazard parking. There is long-pending demand that Corporation and police remove encroachers, while initiating widening of narrow corridors and junctions.Street lightsThe Association further demanded installation of lights and a signal post beneath the bridge to warn people of oncoming trains since most pedestrians would cross the busy rail corridor rather than use the new bridge to reach the other side.
