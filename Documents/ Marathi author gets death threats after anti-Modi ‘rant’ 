A day after criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Marathi author Dr Shripal Sabnis on Saturday filed a police complaint claiming he received death threats for speaking up.At a function in Pimpri-Chinchwad on Friday, Dr Sabnis, who is president of the upcoming 89th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan 2016, had lambasted Mr Modi as a man forever “smeared with the taint of the 2002 Gujarat riots” and a Prime Minister that he would not endorse.The litterateur said he was being urged by Mr Modi’s supporters to retract his controversial remarks else face dire consequences.According to the police, Dr Sabnis has allegedly been receiving a stream of threats demanding an apology, failing which he would face physical harm.Dr Sabnis attempted to clarify the issue by stating that while he did criticise the PM and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in one context, he had, in fact, commended Mr Modi’s ‘courageous’ trip to Pakistan as well as his mention of Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi in his foreign diplomacy.“When he [Modi] went to Pakistan to meet Nawaz Sharif, he could have been killed. Hafiz Saeed was there, Dawood Ibrahim was there. All the terrorist training centres are there and someone’s bullet or bomb might have killed him,” Dr Sabnis had said.The ambivalent statement is being interpreted by the PM’s supporters as one made in bad taste and reflected the author’s ‘desire’ to see Mr Modi killed.“I want to clarify that while I did condemn Mr Modi for the 2002 Gujarat riots, I was praising him for his courageous trip to Pakistan,” Dr Sabnis later said.Rattled by these threats, Dr Sabnis said he would speak to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on the issue.Meanwhile, Ramdas Athawale, president of the Republican Party of India (A) and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ally, threateningly hinted that RPI activists would disrupt the four-day Marathi Sahitya Sammelan that is to commence on January 15 at Pimpri-Chinchwad, if Dr Sabnis further indulged in ‘anti-Modi’ criticism.Speaking at a press conference here, Mr Athawale said that while the 2002 Gujarat riots was a “black chapter in India’s democracy”, PM Modi was a man with “strong secular moorings”.“It is unfair to pin the blame of Gujarat riots on the Prime Minister who respects every religion in this country… If Dr Sabnis indulges in any ‘rants’ against Mr Modi, then RPI activists will not flinch from disrupting the biggest literary event in the Marathi language,” Mr Athawale said.
