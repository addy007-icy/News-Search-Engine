The Kalippara project, conceived by the Kerala Water Authority two decades ago to provide treated water to villages in under the Neyyattinkara taluk, is likely to be commissioned on February 12.“We are expecting power connection within three days and will probably start trial run of the plant this week,” a senior KWA official told The Hindu . The project, which got off in 1994, was put on cold storage for almost six years after Life Insurance Corporation, its initial funding agency, stopped fund allocation in 2003.RevivedIt was revived in 2009-10 after the State government sanctioned Rs.136.40 crore, which came as part of the Rs.5,000-crore budgetary support for public works to fight the adverse impact of global recession.Water will be sourced from Neyyar for treatment in the 36-million-litre capacity plant before being supplied to residents at Neyyattinkara, Parassala, Parasuvekkal, Karumkulam, Kanjiramkulam, Thirupuram, Kulathoor, Karode, Chenkal, Kollayil, Marukil, and Maranalloor villages.“In most of these places the KWA supplies chlorinated water now. The project was conceived after water-borne diseases were reported in these places. The commissioning of the plant will help us provide properly treated water and ensure uninterrupted supply. We can also give new connections,” the official said.
