An auxiliary/traction substation was commissioned at Kochi Metro’s coach maintenance depot in Muttom jointly by DMRC’s MD Mangu Singh and KMRL’s MD Elias George on Saturday.The 110 KV grid supply is expected to be ready by February, 2016. A temporary arrangement is in place now by availing 2 MW power from KSEB, to urgently feed power to third traction laid beside test track at the depot from which coaches will source power for test runs. A 11 KV grid at Muttom is converted to 33 KV using 11/33 KV transformer and the 33 KV supply is fed to traction substation, stepped down and converted to 750 DC supply for energising the third track.The function was attended by A.K. Gupta, director, electrical of DMRC; Mr Jitendra Tyagi, director (works); Praveen Goyal, director, systems of KMRL and Dani Thomas, DMRC’s Kochi Project Director. Earlier in the week, Mr George had switched on the first auxiliary sub-station in the depot. This sub-station will work as the source of power for all utilities in the Muttom depot.
