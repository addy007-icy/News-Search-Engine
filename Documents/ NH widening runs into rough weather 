The transition of the ongoing widening work on the Karamana-Kaliyikkavila stretch of the National Highway 66 to its second reach of Pravachambalam to Vazhimukku is likely to be far from smooth.The district administration, which has been undertaking the land acquisition process within the particular reach in two phases, has been finding the vehement opposition raised by the trading community in Balaramapuram a hard nut to crack. An underpass has also been planned in the busy town.“The development of the stretch will require the removal of several commercial establishments, either partially or fully, in Balaramapuram, which is regarded a trading centre. The uncertainty that is generally seen in rehabilitating traders during development projects has pushed many among them to adopt a negative stance in the issue,” a reliable source said.Certain proposals that have been put forth by the authorities have all failed to persuade the traders as of now.These included a suggestion of land pooling by way of which traders will be rehabilitated in a single complex. A demand raised by the land owners in Balaramapuram for a common land price to the fixed across the locality has been turned down by the officials concerned.These circumstances have thrown a spanner in the land acquisition efforts in the area.According to an official, the success of the entire project depended heavily upon the outcome of the deliberations pertaining to Balaramapuram. “An inability to address the acute traffic congestion in the bottleneck between Balaramapuram to Vazhimukku would render the widening project pointless,” he said.Meanwhile, the acquisition of the land required for the road widening from Pravachambalam to Balaramapuram was nearing its completion. The verification of documents such as the title deeds and the procedure of award enquiry have been completed.It has been planned to award the compensations to the nearly 1,000 landowners from January 13, when the first reach of Karamana to Pravachambalam will be formally opened for traffic.Administrative sanctionHowever, the government has accorded administrative sanction for only Rs.6 crore, while it had assured to release nearly Rs.90 crore to be distributed as compensations for land ceded for the project. With the notification of the impending Assembly elections expected to be issued in the near future, a delay in awarding compensations threatened to push the work on the second reach by some months.
