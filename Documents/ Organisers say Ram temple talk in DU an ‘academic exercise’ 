: Organisers of the seminar on Ram Janmabhoomi temple issue in Delhi University have defended it, calling it an “academic exercise”, even as a group of teachers and students from the varsity continued to protest the talk.The two-day seminar “Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple: Emerging Scenario” starts on Saturday and is being organised at DU’s Arts Faculty by Arundhati Vashishtha Anusandhan Peeth (AVAP), a research outfit founded by late VHP leader Ashok Singhal.One of the organisers of the seminar Sunil Kumar Kashyap, who teaches at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College in DU said: “The seminar is completely an academic exercise as there will be speakers from various parts of the country who will present facts on the Ram Janmabhoomi temple issue. They are just going to discuss the Supreme Court verdict on the matter as the common people are not aware about it. Around 200 people have registered their participation so far.”“We have organised it under the banner of Arundhati Vashishtha Anusandhan Peeth (AVAP) because the organisation keeps conducting such activities. There is no question of 'saffronisation' of the campus here. We booked the venue for the seminar in DU because I am a teacher here and in my capacity I could book the venue, which is available to anyone who wants to conduct any academic activity here,” he added.Meanwhile, students and teachers continued to protest for the second day, demanding cancellation of the seminar.
