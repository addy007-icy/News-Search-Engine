The Madras High Court on Thursday dismissed as withdrawn the plea moved by actor Simbu seeking direction to the Director General of Police (DGP) to issue circular to all the police stations in the State not to register any further FIR against him over the ‘beep’ song row.When the plea came up for hearing before Justice R. Subbiah, the judge noted that the petition is not maintainable and the prayer sought cannot be granted.According to the actor, already two FIRs have been registered against him in Coimbatore and Chennai for allegedly distributing a music track containing words degrading the modesty of women.“Besides the two FIRs, various complaints are being filed on the same issue by individuals as well as associations who are not aggrieved persons, before various police stations throughout the State,” the petitioner said.Simbu alleged that since he is a well-known and established actor in the Tamil film industry, most of such complaints were given for the sake of publicity and with ulterior motive to extract money from him.
