A tech entrepreneur has joined the long list of victims of phishing. Criminals procured a duplicate SIM card of the account handler and siphoned off Rs. 45 lakh between January 13 and January 18.The cyber crime police probing the case experienced a sense of deja vu, as the modus operandi is similar to that of a gang they busted recently.In this case, the victim was Govindaiah, a manager of VAPS group. He was handling two corporate accounts of the group. A few days after his mobile phone stopped functioning, he went to the Reliance store on January 18 to enquire about the reason. He was informed about the issue of a duplicate SIM card.Criminals procured a duplicate SIM card from a Reliance store at Jayanagar by producing a copy of an Aadhaar card of Govindaiah.This new SIM card was used to siphon off Rs. 45 lakh from the two accounts in Vijaya Bank, Basaveshwara Nagar.Cyber Crime police from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have learnt that the money was siphoned off into accounts held by a man named Taraporewalla in Ratnakar Bank, Mumbai and that of Vijaya Kumar, who has an account in State Bank of India (SBI).The money was later transferred to 27 accounts in various banks across the country before it was withdrawn. Police managed to freeze Rs. 5 lakh in one of the 27 accounts.R. Siddesh Kumar, chairman of VAPS group, told The Hindu , “It is very clear that both the telecom service provider and the banking sector have been negligent at best or connived with the phishing gangs at worst, to dupe customers. This has to be probed thoroughly.”
