An amalgamation of different shades of red is what catches the eye at first in ‘Under Surveillance’, the latest solo exhibition of paintings by K.M. Narayanan, under way at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery in Kozhikode.The 30-odd paintings in the brightest hues reflect the present scenario in which each individual lives under the surveillance of some external force round the clock.The title painting which shows people under the surveillance of a CCTV, was inspired by a magazine article on the theme of surveillance as well as the artist’s own week-long stint in a hospital waiting room.He discovered traces of the theme in many other of his earlier paintings that were put together for the exhibition.“It is not just that we are being observed, but we observe too, everything around us,” Mr.Narayanan said.Some of the paintings touch the rapid urbanisation process and its effects on the society.The paintings mention the artist’s concern for the society. The subject matter varies from childhood memories to land, weather, voyage and stories. Nostalgic elements from the yore creep up quite often.An art teacher by profession, Mr.Narayanan has participated in many a group exhibition and has had some solo exhibitions as well.‘Under Surveillance’ was inaugurated by Secretary of the Kerela Lalithakala Akademi Vaikam M.K.Shibu on January 23 in the presence of artist Paul Kallanode.It concludes on January 29.
