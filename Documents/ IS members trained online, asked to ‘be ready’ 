In another example of the rising influence of the Islamic State (IS) on the Internet, it has been revealed that the alleged IS members who were arrested across the country last week were not only radicalised but also trained through the Internet.In a nationwide swoop starting last Friday, the National Investigating Agency (NIA) and Anti-Terrrorism Squads picked up suspects, including three from Maharashtra. One of them, Rizwan Nawazuddin, was taken into custody by the Maharashtra ATS, after it was found that he had a direct link with Malwani youth Ayaz Sultan, who is believed to have joined an IS module in Afghanistan.Assembling bombs“Investigations have revealed that the accused were imparted training in assembling bombs through videos shared online by their handlers in Syria,” said a source. “Several such videos have been widely circulated among the members of the Indian module of the IS.”The Hindu , in its January 21 edition, had reported how the Maharashtra police have raised concerns with the Central government over the growing influence of the IS on the Internet.Three-point missionInvestigations into the interactions between the Indian module members and their handles have revealed that suspects were given a three-point mission: to spread IS propaganda, to radicalise others and prepare them to ‘fight for the cause’, and to identify those recruits willing to go abroad to take up arms.“Ayaz Sultan was one such recruit, and there were others that were being prepared to go abroad. We are finding out details about this,” the source said. A standing instruction issued to all the accused by their handlers were to “be ready to act when the call was given”, said sources.The Maharashtra ATS is likely to seek custody of Mumbra resident Mudabbir Sheikh, believed to be the head of the Indian module, for interrogation after the NIA finishes its inquiries with him in New Delhi.
