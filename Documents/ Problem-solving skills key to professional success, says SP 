“Skills in communication and problem solving help young people achieve success,” Nikam Prakash, Superintendent of Police, has said.He was inaugurating a job mela at BVB College grounds here on Thursday. “The days of using recommendation to get a job are gone. If you want a job, you should show that you have the skills and the confidence to get it done. Otherwise, no corporate company will give you one,” Mr. Prakash said.When human resource managers feel that two bio-datas match on many levels, they ask the aspirants to solve real problems. The one who solves the problem in the shortest time wins the job, he said.The mela was organised by members of the Nagamarapalli family in memory of Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli, who died recently.Mr. Prakash recalled his days as an IT engineer in Infosys and TCS in India and the U.S.A. “I returned to India after a few years and felt I should do something more meaningful with my life. I cleared the civil services examination after a few months of hard work,” he said.Suryakanth Nagamarapalli, one of the organisers, said the family would set up a permanent employment exchange in Bidar to help the local youth. He said 75 companies had set up stalls at the mela.
