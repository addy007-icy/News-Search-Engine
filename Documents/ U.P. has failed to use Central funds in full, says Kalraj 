Union Minister Kalraj Mishra on Wednesday dismissed the repeated accusations of Uttar Pradesh government of non-cooperation by the BJP-led Central government.“The Assembly elections are forthcoming and if they won’t criticise the Centre, then how shall they do (politics),” Mr Mishra told reporters on a question regarding the State accusing the Centre of non-assistance.The Union Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Minister was here to address a conference on Prime Minister’s Employment Guarantee Programme.Stating that Modi government has released more funds for U.P. than any other regime, he said, “When they are unable to utilise the funds given earlier, then how can the Centre be blamed for that?”He said his ministry was making efforts to promote two major schemes ASPIRE and Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme.Under PMEGP, he said, 30,708 units have been set up between 2008 and 2014 under which 3.1 lakh unemployed got job and added that in the last six years the Centre has given a grant of Rs 986 crores to U.P. under the programme.Mr Mishra said in the financial year 2015-16 the Centre has given a grant of Rs 120 crore to the State for setting up 5,978 units to provide employment to 47,824 people.However, he said that the U.P. government could spend only Rs 92.84 crore of the grant, which he said was “a slow progress”. -- PTI
