The discovery of the 45 short-finned pilot whales on the beaches of Thoothukudi district has come as a rude shock to environmentalists and animal activists (“45 whales die on TN coast, 36 pushed back”, Jan. 13).Though it would be presumptuous to assume the reasons behind the whales being washed ashore, the answers could lie in our own failing to protect these wonders of the ocean. Extreme weather patterns and pollution of waters by humans have contributed in large measure to this problem. Whales are highly intelligent and emotional beings with a strong bond, and a distress call sent out by one could cause the entire pod to respond.The fisheries department and the local fishermen deserve applause for pushing back 36 of them.N.J.
