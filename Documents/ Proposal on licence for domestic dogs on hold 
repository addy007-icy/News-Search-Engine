Mangaluru City Corporation has proposed to introduce mandatory licensing system for keeping domestic dogs. But the elected council has applied a break to it for the time being on the grounds that it should be discussed thoroughly.According to the corporation, the licensing system has been proposed to reduce the menace of stray and mad dogs under its jurisdiction. As per the proposal the licences for keeping domestic dogs would have to be renewed every year.The corporation has also proposed to arrange for sterilisation of domestic dogs in all 60 wards by making its owners to pay for it. It would have to constitute a seven-member dog welfare committee as per the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001 under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. But the council has put these two proposals also on hold.The dog welfare committee should be headed by the Commissioner of the corporation. Its other members should be chairperson, standing committee for public health, education and social justice; a government veterinary doctor, a representative of a non-government organiation, health officer of the corporation, two councillors and the contractor of the animal birth control programme of the corporation.Prakash Saliyan, chairman, Standing Committee for Public Health, Education and Social Justice told The Hindu that many domestic dogs wandered on the streets during the night. Hence there is a need to control the dog menace.
