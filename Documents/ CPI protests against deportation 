Objecting to the treatment meted out to Indian students by US immigration officials, CPI members staged protests at the US consulate in Begumpet on Tuesday.About 200 members gathered at the consulate and raised slogans slamming the US for sending back the students with valid visas. The members accused officials of causing mental trauma to the students and ruining their future. “The deportation of the students is unjustified. We demand a compensation of Rs. 1 crore to each of the harassed students along with bearing their education fees,” said senior CPI leader K. Narayana, who was arrested during the protests.“Why are only Indian students being targeted and not those from China or other countries?” he asked.
