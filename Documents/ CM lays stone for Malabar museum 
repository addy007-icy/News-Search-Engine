Chief Minister Oommen Chandy laid the foundation stone for the Bishop Valloppilly Memorial Migration Museum at Chembanthotti here on Monday.The museum being set up by the Cultural Affairs Department is envisaged as an institution to highlight the history and legacy of farmers who had migrated from southern Kerala to the Malabar region.In his address, Mr. Chandy said that the migrant farmers had played a key role in the nationâ€™s achievements in agricultural production. They had settled in areas infested with wild animals and lived with no basic amenities for healthcare and education. The eastern hill areas of the region had developed over the years with the contribution of the migrant farmers, he said adding that no development was possible by ignoring the farmers.Recalling the contributions of late Bishop Valloppilly, Mr. Chandy said that the late prelate had struggled for the rights and demands of the settler farmers. Cultural Affairs Minister K.C. Joseph presided over the function. He said that the museum is being set up for the perpetuation of the memory of history of the Malabar migration. The museum project is estimated at Rs. 2 crore, he informed.
