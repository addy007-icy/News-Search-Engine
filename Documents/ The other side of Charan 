Sons of famous fathers have never had it easy. Charan is no exception. Despite making path-breaking movies like Chennai 600028 and Aaranya Kaandam, Charan is still in the process of carving a niche for himself. “The shadow is only increasing by the day, so I decided to stop fighting it and instead embrace it,” he says with a smile.Charan wears many hats—he is a singer, actor and producer. We’ve been friends since the late 90s and caught up again quite recently. He remains the same approachable person I knew back then, a quality I admire in him. When he walked into our office, our seven-month-old golden retriever greeted him. A dog-lover himself, Charan wasn’t flustered at all.In fact, for about 15 minutes, he didn’t as much exchange a greeting with me, as he was playing with the dog. I knew then the shot I wanted to take.
