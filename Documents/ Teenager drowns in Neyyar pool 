A 16-year-old boy, identified as Jobin Das of Mulayara, drowned in a swimming pool attached to the Neyyar dam on Saturday.According to T.R. Kiran, Sub-inspector, Neyyar Dam police, Jobin, son of Yesudasan, and a Plus One student of the Open School in Thirumala, had reached the dam area along with four of his friends on a sightseeing trip on Saturday.They went to the Irrigation Departmentâ€™s swimming pool attached to the dam. There were other tourists as well.Since Jobin did not know swimming, he was treading water in a shallow portion of the pool by holding onto the rails along the poolside. His friends told police that they did not notice him walking towards the deeper end.It was only after they climbed out of the pool that they noticed him missing.Only later did they think that he could have drowned. The ensuing search, for which lifeguards and Fire and Rescue Service personnel were called in, ended around 12.30 p.m. when his body was found at the bottom of the deepest end.The body was shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital morgue, with the autopsy to be performed on Sunday. Jobin is survived by his parents and a sister.
