Kerala Tourism’s Visit Kerala initiative to promote the destination will be extended by another year from April 2016.A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting convened by Minister for Tourism A.P. Anil Kumar on Tuesday with industry stakeholders to discuss steps to overcome the crisis in view of the drop in tourist arrivals to the State from Europe.The initiative, which includes events ranging from arts to sports under the slogan Season of Surprises to promote God’s Own Country and niche tourism products, would go on for another year, Principal Secretary, Tourism, G. Kamala Vardhana Rao told The Hindu here.The tourism authorities are yet to take a call on whether there is any need to shift the focus from Ayurveda, festivals, cuisine, Responsible Tourism, Spice Route, Muziris Heritage, and new destinations.The decision also comes in the wake of the not-so encouraging response to the marketing drive and criticism from stakeholders that the initiative was launched last year without adequate groundwork.To know the pulse of the market, meetings would be held with the stakeholders on the first Wednesday of every month, it was decided at the meeting.To offset the dip in arrivals, the department will explore new markets and explore China and the United States more. Three roadshows will be held in China in the coming months. Following criticism over the tourist statistics released by the department, the Minister informed the meeting that he would personally look into the figures. Mr. Anil Kumar urged the stakeholders not to highlight the negative trends in the industry. The government was ready to support chartered flight operations from Russia to the State, he said.Participants at the meeting demanded enhanced connectivity to the State, more funds for marketing to attract domestic tourists and focus on beach tourism.Kerala Tourism had targeted over 1.37 crore tourist arrivals in 2015. In 2014, foreign tourist arrivals were 9,23,366, 7.6 per cent higher than 2013.
