Chief Minister Oommen Chandy will appear before the solar judicial commission here on Monday. Mr. Chandy, who has been listed as a witness in the case, is expected to appear before Justice G. Sivarajan at 11 a.m. to tender evidence in the case. Mr. Chandy has already filed a written affidavit before the commission. The panel, the tenure of which will end in April, is planning to submit a comprehensive report before the end of its term. It had examined Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan, KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran, State Police Chief T.P. Senkumar, among others, as witnesses in the case.There is no compulsion on the Chief Minister and others who had been served notice under this section to appear before the Commission. However, Mr. Chandy had offered to appear before the Commission to be examined. This would be one of the rarest instances of a Chief Minister being examined by a Commission of Inquiry.Since he has already filed what is known as a 'proof affidavit', which is essentially his version of the entire events leading up to the judicial inquiry, there may not be much direct questioning of the Chief Minister. However, the Commission might well choose to seek clarifications from Mr. Chandy on several of the statements already made by other witnesses.It would examine Saritha Nair, one of the prime accused in the solar scam, on Tuesday.
