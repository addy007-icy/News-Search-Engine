The K.R. Narayanan Chair instituted at the School of Social Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), here was formally inaugurated on Saturday.Inaugurating the Chair, Rural Development Minister K.C. Joseph underscored the need for continuing vigil in all sectors to ensure the uplift of Dalits. While the nation had put in place constitutional safeguards for the purpose, Dalits were at the receiving end of social ostracism and injustice in many of the States with the State machinery relegated to the role of a mute witness, he said. One of the most effective mechanisms to engineer change in this regard was interventions sustained by academic work, he said.In his acceptance speech, Sukhdeo Thorat, chairman, Indian Council for Social Sciences Research, who has been awarded the first K.R. Narayanan Chair, said the human development indices of the Dalit segment in Kerala were better compared to many other States. However, when compared to the social development of other communities within the State, much more policy interventions were needed for the social emancipation of the Dalit community, he said.According to Vice Chancellor Babu Sebastian, the university would begin works to raise the Chair to a fully functional study and research centre.K. Suresh Kurup, MLA; syndicate members Satheesh Kochuparambil and N. Jayakumar, Registrar M.R. Unni and others spoke.â€“ Special Correspondent
