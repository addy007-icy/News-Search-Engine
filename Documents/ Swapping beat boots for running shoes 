Among the thousands of people participating in the Mumbai Marathon this year, 152 participants will be debunking an age-old perception that the public in general has of the quintessential policeman: that of a pot bellied man, heavy-eyed man chewing tobacco.What the Mumbai Police find heartening is that the number of policemen participating each year is increasing. While 142 policemen participated in the Marathon last year, the number of participants has gone up by 10 this year. In a life filled with stress, even a small increase is a good sign, say officers.Of the 152 policemen participating this year, 22 will be running the marathon, and 90 will be participating in the half marathon. Another positive trend, policemen said, is that the number of constables is higher among the participants.A total of 71 constables are running the half marathon, while 13 are running the marathon. Senior policemen put down the rise in numbers to the practice of leading by example.DCP (Detection) Dhananjay Kulkarni, who is running the marathon this year, said that two Police Inspectors working under him switched from the half marathon to the marathon following his example.“Not just policemen, a lot of civilians who jog at Shivaji Park, where I run every day, have also become Marathon converts,” said Mr Kulkarni, who will be participating for the third time this year.Mr Kulkarni started out two years ago with the half marathon and switched to the full marathon last year.As the Marathon draws near, he sets a target of 100 km every week to prepare for the strenuous run, putting in over three hours of running every weekend.“Running has always been a passion for me. It has worked wonders for my physique and nobody believed me when I tell them I am 54 years old,” said Assistant Commissioner of Police Fulsing Pawar, Protection and Security, Mumbai.Mr Pawar has been running the full marathon since 2004, and it is only for the last three years that he switched to the half marathon. “Somewhere, you do need to take the age factor into account. Hence the switch,” he added. Mr Pawar trains for nearly three-and-a-half hours every morning.
