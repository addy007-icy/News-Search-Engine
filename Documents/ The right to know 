Ignorantia juris non excusat is a Latin maxim meaning ignorance of law is not an excuse. It’s a dictum members of Society For Imparting Fundamental Legal Awareness (SIFLA) preach. SIFLA, an organisation that comprises mostly advocates and law students of Kerala Law Academy, are on a mission to spread awareness on the rights of people.The society, which holds free legal aid programmes and awareness events, is a brainchild of Vishnu Nair, a final year law student of Kerala Law Academy.Says Vishnu: “Nearly 85 per cent of the society is unaware of their rights. As I enjoy teaching I thought I would start holding classes on basic law at various avenues. We started out by holding workshops at Elders’ Forums where we addressed the various laws that would concern them starting from the rights they can seek when their children abandon them to how to settle property disputes.” SIFLA soon shifted their attention to students as “they are the next generation of citizens.”So far, the members of SIFLA have visited schools such as Lécole Chempaka, NSS Perunthanni, Chinmaya Vidyalaya (Vazhuthacaud), MGM School and Salvation Army School and are in talks about holding workshops in schools in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“We hold legal-cum-motivational classes for these students. A few weeks after our session at Lécole Chempaka, the principal called up saying some of the students of the school were insisting they viewed the photos the school had clicked for their ID cards before the school printed them. While it might be annoying for the staff, it is good that the children know that no one can take or print their picture without their permission. By imparting legal education to young students, you are nurturing a generation of responsible citizens,” says Vishnu.
