A hundred years of serving the bibliophiles of the city, and counting. The State Central Library, located within Cubbon Park, is all set for its centenary celebrations this month.Fondly called the people’s university, the library houses over 3.14 lakh books, the largest collection in Karnataka. It claims to have a copy of every book brought out by publishing houses in the State since 1970.Given its importance, it’s hard to believe that the State Central Library was just an afterthought. The majestic building that houses it was built in the memory of Seshadri Iyer, the former Dewan of Mysore. It is interesting to note that the building was built from crowd-sourced funds of Rs. one lakh in 1913. A committee of prominent citizens of the city, formed to perpetuate the memory of the contributions of the former Dewan, later found it apt to start a library in the premises.A private lending library was started in 1915 with 215 members and 4,750 books. It was taken over by the State government in 1966. The library, however, stopped lending books and became a reference library in 1986 after reportedly losing many books.The Department of Public Libraries has chalked out an elaborate programme, including a two-day national seminar, a souvenir with articles from Kannada’s leading writers and the unveiling of a digital library of 15,000 pre-1950 books.“But the priority is fixing the leaking roof of the century-old heritage building,” said Satish Kumar S. Hosamani, Director, Department of Public Libraries.
