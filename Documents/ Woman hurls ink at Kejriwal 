A woman threw ink at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as he was addressing a ‘thanksgiving’ session to celebrate the success of the Delhi government’s odd-even scheme here on Sunday evening.The woman, who identified herself as Bhavna and appeared to be in her 20s, claimed she was in possession of proof of an alleged ‘CNG scam’ linked to the odd-even scheme. The woman, who was detained by the police and whisked away for questioning, also hurled a CD and some papers at the podium from which Mr. Kejriwal was speaking.Member of splinter groupAfter being overpowered by a contingent of Delhi Police personnel, Bhavna claimed she is a member of an Aam Aadmi Party splinter group based in Punjab.“It is a breach of security especially with the Republic Day celebrations round the corner... The entire Delhi Cabinet was present, but there was no policeman,” Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia later alleged at a press conference.“The [Delhi] police is under the BJP control...What if it was a bomb or acid? Delhi Police claims to be on high alert, but they are hollow claims. It is a conspiracy by the BJP.”The Delhi BJP condemned the incident but said in a statement that ‘it reflects the growing frustration amongst people towards the Kejriwal regime.’The AAP said in a statement that ‘the incident is not only a major security breach, but points to the involvement of Delhi Police officials in the conspiracy.’ The party said that at a time when the Delhi Police claimed to be on high alert after the recent terror attack in Pathankot, it was unimaginable that a woman could breach the security cordon and attack the Chief Minister.“The allegations are misconceived and unfounded,” said a senior Delhi Police official. “Appropriate law and order arrangements were made at the Chhatrasal stadium function by the Delhi Police as is the practice for CM’s functions. In fact, enhanced police deployment was made for law and order maintenance in view of the large crowd expected to attend the function.”
