Oil giant HPCL has big plans for investment in Visakhapatnam and its neighbourhood with plans to kick off work on expansion of Visakh Refinery and enter into a joint venture agreement with GAIL to set up a Greenfield refinery near the city.After a long delay, the HPCL management is happy that it could get green signal from Ministry of Environment and Forests last month for expanding the capacity of Visakh Refinery from 8.33 to 15 million tonne with a total investment of Rs.18,400 crore. Once tenders for various works are awarded, the work will gain momentum. The timeline fixed to complete the project from date of getting MoEF clearance is three years. The MoEF had earlier rejected the applications for expansion on the ground of imposing a moratorium on Greenfield and Brownfield projects after declaring the city as ‘critically polluted.’The tag was taken off a couple years ago after improvement in emission parameters – an issue which is strongly objected by environmentalists and social activists. The refinery set up in 1957 by Caltex with an installed capacity of 1.5 million tonne was merged with HPCL in May 1978. The capacity was increased to 4.5 million tonne in 1985 and 7.5 million tonne in 1999.Petrochemical complexAt the public hearing held in the city on June 26, a large number of residents as well as activists had alleged that HPCL’s track-record in industrial accidents was very bad and it should refrain from expanding the capacity in an area surrounded by densely populated areas.However, the management while allaying the fears claimed that due to adherence to best practices followed world-wide there would not be any pollution unlike the past.HPCL will go ahead with establishing a petrochemical complex in partnership with GAIL with an estimated investment of Rs.25,000 crore to Rs.30,000 crore, Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers Ananth Kumar had told the CII Partnership Summit and Sunrise AP Investment Summit here on January 12.Earlier, HPCL had proposals for a Greenfield refinery as well as petrochemical complex for which it had approached APIIIC for allotment of suitable land between Visakhapatnam and Kakinada. A meeting will be held between the Centre and the State government next month to work out the modalities to go ahead with the petrochemical complex.
