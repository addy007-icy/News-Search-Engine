Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party president Asaduddin Owaisi’s ‘beef’ remarks at public meetings, as part of the GHMC election campaign, has ended up reviving the controversy in the city.Mr. Owaisi, during his election campaign in Uppuguda area in old city last Monday, had said, “If the Majlis does not come to power then there is a scope for a ban on beef in the city. I am not saying this to scare you, but take the example of Mumbai where BJP-Shiv Sena combine closed down meat shops for six to eight days.”Cow slaughter is prohibited across the country, but in Maharasthra, the BJP government has imposed a ban on slaughter of bulls too, even if the animal is ill, he told the gathering.He continued saying that the poor cannot afford mutton. “If someone else comes to power, they would do it on pretext of faith. Poor people will be deprived of beef while the traders lose their means of livelihood,” Mr. Owaisi said during the public address.Responding to these comments, BJP legislator from Goshamahal Raja Singh said those who eat beef need not vote for him. “It is my personal opinion. I would request people not to slaughter cow or bull. Moreover, people who eat cow or bull meat should not vote for me,” he told a vernacular television channel.
