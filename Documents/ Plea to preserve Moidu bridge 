While the formal inauguration of the new bridge built parallel to the steel bridge known as Moidu Bridge across the Anjarakkandy river at Dharmadom here is expected in a couple of weeks, there is a demand for preservation of the dilapidated bridge built during the British period as a major link between North Malabar and the rest of the State.According to the Public Works Department (National Highway Division) the original estimate of the works for the construction of the new bridge to replace the old steel bridge built in 1930 in the Kannur-Kozhikode route of the National Highway 17 included the works for dismantling the 86-year old bridge. However, the demand for preserving the old bridge as a piece of heritage has been raised as preparations are under way for the commissioning of the new bridge."The proposal for preserving the Moidu Bridge in consideration of its historic importance has been made by Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju," said Dharmadom MLA, K.K. Narayanan.He told The Hindu that the local people are also in favour of keeping the bridge well maintained for its preservation.He also said that the requirement of periodic maintenance to protect the steel bridge from corrosion will be a major obstacle to its protection.The PWD (NH Division) officials said that they received a representation from a committee of local people demanding that the old bridge should not be demolished when the new bridge is awaiting formal opening."We have forwarded the representation along with our report to our higher authorities to take a decision on the proposal," said P.K. Mini, Executive Engineer of the PWD (NH Division) here.Any decision in this regard will be taken at the higher level, she informed.The work of the new bridge is now complete and it has been opened for traffic. The date of its formal inauguration is yet to be decided as the officials are awaiting confirmation of date of the Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari to come over here to inaugurate the bridge.
