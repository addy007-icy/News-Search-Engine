The declaration of the calendar of events for elections to the zilla panchayats across the State could be delayed as the Principal and Kalaburagi Benches of the High Court of Karnataka issued two directions asking the State Election Commission (SEC) to pause issuance of the election notification.While Kalaburagi Bench passed an interim order directing the SEC not to issue the calendar of events to hold elections to Kalaburagi and Bidar ZPs, coming under its jurisdiction for now, the Principal Bench in Bengaluru orally instructed the SECâ€™s counsel that it would not be proper for the SEC to issue notification when the court was hearing the petitions challenging laws on reserving seats in the ZPs for different castes.Justice Ram Mohan Reddy of Kalaburagi Bench passed the interim order asking the SEC not to proceed further based on the notification issued by the commission on December 4, 2015 in which seats in different ZPs were reserved for various castes as per the rules governing reservation of seats based on rotation.At Principal Bench, Justice S. Abdul Nazeer, who heard a batch of petitions questioning legality of reservation for the ZPs of Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts, Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Mysuru, orally told the SEC counsel to advise the commission that it would not be proper to issue the calendar of events when the issue was pending consideration before the court.Mr. Justice Nazeer gave oral instruction after the SEC counsel indicated that the notification may be issued by Monday. The Principal Bench will continue hearing on the petitions on Friday.In some cases, the petitioners have questioned the legality of reserving seats to particular castes. Some petitioners have questioned the amendment made by the State to the Section 162 of the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act in 2015 limiting the continuation of a cycle of rotation of reservation for a seat in the ZPs only for 10 years. Limiting rotation for 10 years would provide opportunity for reserving a seat for only two category of castes and deprive the other castes the benefit of reservation, the petitioners claimed.
