After publishing the electoral rolls on January 20, the Chief Electoral Officer, Tamil Nadu, encouraged the voters to check their names and other details online. What he did not expect was the crashing of server.Bombarded with more than one crore hits over the past five days, the TN Elections Department’s server functioning from Ahmedabad in Gujarat almost crashed.“Within five days since the release of the rolls on January 20, we have seen more than a crore hits in our server. It almost crashed and was down for half-a-day. We wrote to the BSNL to double the capacity with one more server. Now, it is functioning,” Chief Electoral Officer Rajesh Lakhoni said.As of 5 p.m. on Monday, the average hits per minute were 450 and over 7,500 persons had used system in just half an hour cramming the servers. On Monday alone, the server received over 4.5 lakh hits.“Though we are happy with the response we also doubt whether auto checking programmes are being used to check their names by voters. Anyway, increasing the capacity of the server is the solution for this issue,” he said.About 18 per cent to 20 per cent of the hits were from mobile phones and the remaining was from either laptops or desktops.The software used by the CEO’s office also shows that names in the electoral roll being checked are that of persons who are between 18 and 27 years.
