The deteriorating rights of the Indian working class was succinctly depicted in the July 2012 incident of labour unrest at Manesar (“Labour’s love lost”, Jan.1). The system of outsourcing and contractual labour, never thought of before, is now rampant even in government undertakings. Even with labour laws in place, nobody bothers to uphold even the the most basic of rights. With successive governments, since 1991, trying to dilute labour laws, and the present government hostile to the idea of labour reforms, it is time the Indian working class unites to fight anti-people reform. Why should there be hostility towards the workforce? It should not be forgotten that trade unions have played a major role in stopping multinationals — and now beholden to the government — from running riot.G.B. Sivanandam,Coimbatore
