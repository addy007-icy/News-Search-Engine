A 67-year-old Kenyan citizen, who was undergoing treatment at Fortis Hospital in Mulund, collapsed at Terminal 2 of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on Thursday, minutes before he was to board a flight back home to Nairobi. He was taken back to the hospital in the same ambulance that had dropped him to the airport, officials at the airport said.Fortis officials said the Kenyan had been admitted to their Mulund facility on December 27. “He had been diagnosed with end-stage lung disease in Kenya and he flew to India to get another opinion,” said Dr Preyas Vaidya from the Lung Care team of Fortis, Mulund. He said the patient underwent tests and his condition of pulmonary fibrosis and reflux esophagitis was confirmed. “But he was mobile and did not require oxygen. He was discharged on Monday and we did not hear from him for past three days. We had given him fit to fly,” Dr Vaidya said.The patient was also a diabetic and on Thursday soon after he entered the airport on a wheelchair, his son saw him droop, Dr Vaidya said, following which he was put on the floor and given CPR.Airport officials said the Kenyan was booked on KQ 205 to Nairobi, and collapsed near the Kenya Airways counter near Island E. The Kenyan Airways staff alerted the medical team, which gave him emergency medical aid. Fortis doctors said they were surprised when the patient was wheeled into the casualty. “He is in the ICU for observation. His heart function is normal,” Dr Vaidya said.
