The poor and dry condition of the big lake in Koolamedu village in Attur union, spread over two acres has remained dry for the past more than ten years, much to the anxiety of the entire farming community.Three supply channels used to supply water to this lake, but they have almost lost their shape due to the failure to desilt and renovate them for years together. One of the channels has become a cart route.The lake in Kondayampalli village, a little distance away, used to receive copious water whenever River Swethanathi carried water.A. Kandasamy, former president of the Koolamedu panchayat, favours digging of a channel to supply water from Kondayampalli Lake to Koolamedu Lake via Moolaputhur. The digging of a supply channel for a length of two km will not be a costly affair, he said and demanded the government to seriously consider this proposal.The water in the lake will immensely help in re-charging the ground water level and improving the storage in the open and bore wells in the area, he says.With ground water level alarmingly going down, the government machinery is not inclined to sanction funds for the sinking of bore wells and digging open wells in Koolamedu and surrounding villages, he says with anxiety writ large on his face.
