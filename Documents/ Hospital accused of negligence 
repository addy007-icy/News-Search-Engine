Cheluvamba Hospital, which is already in the midst of a storm over the discovery of a newborn girl child in the commode, witnessed a protest over the death of a newborn boy. Shobha, wife of Chandre Gowda of Mudugere, delivered a boy on Tuesday. But, when the doctors informed the parents that the baby had died and handed the body to them a few hours later, the angry parents and their relatives accused the doctors of medical negligence. Chandre Gowda lodged a complaint with the Devaraja police on Wednesday. He also claimed that a junior doctor and a nurse had struck his wife. However, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute Dean Krishnamurthy denied allegations of assault and medical negligence levelled against the hospital staff. “This is a referral hospital and most of the cases come here very late. However, the hospital staff try their best,” he said.
