The office-bearers of South Indian Artistes Association or Nadigar Sangam said on Sunday that they will initiate legal action against former president Sarath Kumar for not handing over proper accounts for financial transactions conducted in the Sangam during their tenure.Addressing a press meet, Nadigar Sangam president Nasser said Sarath Kumar had not filed accounts or related statements even three months after elections. “Since we are yet to receive proper audited accounts of Nadigar Sangam for 2014-15 and Nadigar Sangam Charitable Trust’s accounts for the year 2013-14, 2014-15, the office-bearers will initiate legal action against the former office-bearers – former president, general secretary and treasurer,” said Nasser.Three months timeTreasurer Karthi said the decision to pursue legal action was taken only after giving them ample time. “We gave them three months since we didn’t want to be seen as being vindictive,” he said.“On January 9, they submitted two years’ accounts for the Nadigar Sangam Charitable Trust. But they submitted unauthenticated papers and vouchers. So, we have asked them to handover the accounts properly. Since the EC members are raising questions, we have decided to issue them a show cause notice,” he said.On the collection of information on association members under the ‘Guru Dakshina’ scheme, Karthi said the process of data collection was over and they will soon begin work on developing a comprehensive database with photos of the members.
