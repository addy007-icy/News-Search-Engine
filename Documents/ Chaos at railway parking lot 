With an ever-increasing flow of vehicles and poor space management, it is chaos in the parking area on the Kozhikode Railway station premises as agitated commuters try to find parking space for their vehicles.Though a standard sum is collected as parking fee, the facility offered to them is far below the expected standards.“Leave your new vehicle for at-least two hours at this parking lot, then you will understand the real plight of vehicle owners. It will be full of dents and scratches by the time you leave the compound with the vehicle,” says Byju Aneesh, a business executive who travels between Kozhikode and Vadakara on a regular basis. He says there is no guarantee that it will not be stolen.As the space is always crowded with vehicles, the private agency that runs the parking lot is now allowing commuters to park their vehicles in the middle of the ground.Consequently, the vehicle owners who come to get back their vehicles after their journey are stranded in the parking bay with no convenient passage to exit. Some have suggested developing the available space with multi-level parking facility.“Two-wheeler owners are somehow managing as parking in any other place around the railway station is strictly banned. For the Light Motor Vehicle owners, the plight is even worse than one can imagine,” says Sobin Mathew who got his car back full of scratches. “Even though you pay Rs.25 for 24 hours of parking, there is no one answerable for the protection of the property,” he points out.Meanwhile, Railway department sources confirm that some positive changes are likely in the area as the Railways are planning to hand over the management of parking spaces to Women Self Help Groups. A recent meeting of the Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (DRUCC) had even lauded the commendable service rendered by women’s groups in Ernakulam and Thrissur railway stations and chances are likely for the same method to be tried out in Kozhikode, they said.
