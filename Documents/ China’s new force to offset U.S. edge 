The superiority of arch-rival United States in the air and sea may have driven China to revamp its nuclear and conventional missile forces and bring about sweeping changes to its military command and control architecture.A write-up in China Military Online, the website of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), quoting an in-house military expert, points out that the Second Artillery Force (SAF) — the institution that had exercised operational control over the country’s nuclear forces — had been upgraded as the PLA Rocket Force (PRF).Without naming the U.S., Song Zhongping, a former instructor at the PLA Second Artillery Engineering University, says that this is because the “country on the other side of the ocean has a powerful navy and air force and boasts the world’s top air and sea supremacy and strongest conventional long-range precision strike and delivery capability”. He acknowledges that in the “short term,” China would be unable to “comprehensively compete” with these capabilities.Modernising arsenalConsequently, in order to compensate, China has decided to modernise its nuclear deterrent and conventional missiles.The PRF has now been upgraded into a full-fledged new service on a par with the Army, Air Force and the Navy. Mr. Song explained that unlike its predecessor, the SAF, which was an independent arm in China’s military system, the emergence of a full-fledged service would imply having “several arms and special troops” apart from having “academies, research institutes and logistic support system.”The new service, as it evolves, is expected to deploy its nuclear assets on land, sea and air. Mr. Song pointed out that after incorporating the Navy’s strategic nuclear submarine and the Air Force’s strategic bomber, the PRF would become the first independent service with land, sea and air nuclear forces in the world, more integrated than the nuclear forces in the U.S., Russia, Britain and France.The PRF is also expected to separate its nuclear and conventional wings. The nuclear missiles would be responsible for strategic nuclear deterrence, while conventional missiles would be used in the first round of strikes. “In the long term, the PLA Rocket Force may transfer short-range ballistic missiles to the Army to extend its range of strike,” observed Mr. Song.The write-up says the PRF would have an edge because of deep cuts in Russian and U.S. missile forces that were made under previous arms control agreements.For instance, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union had signed an agreement in 1987 to cut their ground-to-ground missiles, with ranges from 500 to 5,500 km. As a result, America’s Pershing II and land-based Tomahawk, and the former Soviet Union’s SS-4, SS-12, SS-20 and SS-23 missiles were all destroyed. Consequently, the U.S. does not possess tactical ballistic missiles or land-based cruise missile in its arsenal. The Russian army has only two types of short-range tactical missiles.Washington’s allies also do not possess a 360 degree deterrent, illustrated by Britain and France having no land-based nuclear missiles. “As China hasn’t signed any agreement of this kind, it has established the world’s most complete ballistic missile strike system, including both nuclear and conventional missiles, with the high-precision medium-range ballistic missile standing out in the world,” the article said. This is demonstrated by the induction of the DF-26 missiles, showcased during China’s military parade on September 3 last year. The weapon can deliver both nuclear and conventional warheads, bringing Guam within its 4,000-km range as well as aircraft carriers — the core of U.S. military assertion in the Pacific.
