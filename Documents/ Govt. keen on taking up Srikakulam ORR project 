Srikakulam district administration is keen on construction of Outer Ring Road Project (ORR) all along Srikakulam town to ensure better civic infrastructure and other facilities for people living on the outskirts. The officials felt that ORR will help development of new satellite townships and reduce the density of population within the town.It is observed that people are not moving towards Pedapadu (Narasannapeta route), Srikakulam-Amadalavalasa route and Navabharat Junction towards Etcherla due to lack of amenities such as municipal water, drainage and electricity in a few localities.It estimated that the government needed around Rs.150 crore for the construction of ORR Project and payment of compensation to the persons who lost their properties. Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham, Joint Collector Vivek Yadav and others assured the locals that the project would benefit the town in many ways although it would lead to acquisition of land in a few areas.Several residents of Pedapadu had already strongly protested over the ORR project and stopped surveys recently in their village located on the outskirts of Srikakulam. According to sources, the Ring Road would cover Ponnada Bridge-Collectorate-Kunikipeta-Khazipeta- Arasavalli-National Highway and Navabharat Junction. The total stretch would be around 12 km.“We need private lands too in some places. But it does not mean that land is acquired wherever survey is taken place. The government would acquire lands only after paying the market value if necessary,” said a senior official. Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham, Joint Collector Vivek Yadav and others held several meetings and asked the survey teams to complete the tasks since government was giving top priority for the ORR Project.The Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority would prepare a detail project report once route and exact acquisition of lands are identified.Opposition parties have already backed the agitation . The officials clarified that the survey was meant for fixation of alignment and it need not be for acquiring lands.Officials estimate Rs. 150 crore needed forlandacquisition
