The Supreme Court on Friday said it will soon consider the report of the apex court-appointed Justice R.M. Lodha committee set up to recommend reforms in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).A Bench of Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur and Justice R. Banumathi agreed to hear the plea made by Cricket Association of Bihar for urgent hearing on the recommendations of the Justice Lodha panel submitted to the apex court in a report on January 4, 2016. The Bench, however, did not give a date for the hearing.The Justice Lodha committee had gone for a root-and-branch overhaul of the BCCI superstructure, including a recommendation that a nine-member apex council should replace the 14-member BCCI working committee.It had said that five of the nine office-bearers, namely its president, vice-president, secretary, joint-secretary and treasurer should not be either government servant or minister. The office-bearers should not have crossed 70 years of age, should be an Indian and not an insolvent.The Lodha report also favours three-year terms for office-bearers with a mandatory cooling-off period after each term.In case of BCCI president, no person can hold the office for more than two terms.‘One State, One Vote’The committee also introduced the dictum ‘One State, One Vote’, which means only cricket associations representing the States would be full members and have voting rights in the 30-member general body of the BCCI. This, the committee, said was to ensure an “equitable voting pattern”.The court also recommended more representation for women’s cricket and measures to foster greater participation from the six Northeast States.Again, the committee said zones would only be relevant for the purpose of tournaments conducted among themselves, but not for nomination to the governance of the board or to various standing committees.The committee said State associations would come under the scrutiny and audit of the BCCI and include players in membership and management and recommended ban on proxy voting.The committee introduced professionalism in management by recommending the appointment of a CEO assisted by six managers to exclusively handle “non-cricketing affairs” and handle the day-to-day management of the BCCI.The selection, coaching, performance and umpiring are to be handled by cricket committees and setting up of cricket players’ association.The committee has laid down detailed norms on conflict of interest situations, suggested an ombudsman to resolve internal disputes and electoral officers to be nominated two weeks prior to BCCI elections to monitor the polls.
