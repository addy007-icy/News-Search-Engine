: The Capital may, arguably, still be waiting to breathe cleaner air but there seems to be hope still when it comes to putting a leash on Delhi’s ever-expanding vehicular population.Even as its contribution to making a dent in the Capital’s ambient air quality is under scrutiny, there's one thing that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s odd-even vehicle rationing experiment has proved: Delhiites are willing to go the extra mile to decongest the city’s streets if challenged to step up to the plate.And, according to various accounts both from commuters and the government, the experiment has also succeeded in reigning in Delhi’s auto-rickshaw drivers – nationally infamous if not beyond – for “unbecoming behaviour” that ranges from refusing potential passengers to over-charging to not going by the meter.Much-awaited “behavioural change”Transport Minister Gopal Rai’s statements lauding the citizens of Delhi for exhibiting what he claimed was a “behavioural change”, was seconded by Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Muktesh Chander, who said that gradually diminishing number of fines issued since the scheme was rolled out on January 1 indicates increasing compliance.In fact, according to a senior government functionary, the Delhi Traffic Police has not only displayed that it is on the same page as the AAP government when it comes to odd-even, its representatives have lauded the Transport Department’s decision to enforce it.Lesser fines equal “more compliance”The declining trend of prosecution figures, according to Mr. Chander, spoke in favour of compliance.While these remained at a measly figure of 145 fines on January 1 — when they had chose to settle for generating awareness about the provisions of the scheme over issuing fines — over 200 teams composed of traffic, transport and other government personnel have gradually chosen relentless enforcement since.Close to 500 challans were issued on the following day despite it being a Saturday followed by the dreaded “litmus test” of the scheme — a Monday, which led to 1,997 fines being issued.While they had remained high before the weekend, the number of fines issued to drivers of private vehicles by the Transport Department were recorded at 71 on January 6 followed by 41 on January 7, 46 on January 8 and 48 on January 9.Pollution vs. de-congestionNodal Minister for anti-pollution Satyendra Jain chose to laud the scheme for ensuring that fewer drivers were being forced to breathe the city’s polluted air due to relatively shorter commuting times resulting from de-congested streets.Mr. Rai has put on record that an analysis of pollution data will form the bedrock of successive anti-pollution measures to be adopted by the Delhi government in the future.“Pollution levels will be put to scrutiny at the end of the scheme’s 15-day trial period but talk to any Delhiite and he or she will tell you that the most tangible and visible success of the scheme relates to traffic congestion,” Mr. Rai told The Hindu .
