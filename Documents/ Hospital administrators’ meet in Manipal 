H.S. Ballal, Pro Chancellor of Manipal University, said on Friday that the focus of teaching hospitals should be to provide quality healthcare to patients with a self-sustaining financial mechanism.He was presiding over the inauguration of one-day Hospital Administrators Conclave organized by the Kasturba Hospital, here. The theme of the conclave was: “Creating operational efficiency.” Delegates from 30 private medical colleges of seven States attended the conclave.Dr. Ballal said usually patients from lower economic strata got admitted to the teaching hospitals attached to medical colleges. It was difficult for them to afford the high costs of treatment. Hence hospitals should start issuing health insurance cards, where they could bear nearly 90 per cent of the premium and the patients, the rest of premium.Hospitals should not needlessly extend the stay of the patients.An increased stay in hospitals of the patients was a burden both for the patients and also the hospitals. The quality of treatment should not be compromised. Hospital administrators should behave politely with the patients and relatives.Nurses play a vital role in developing the image of a hospital as they spend the maximum time with the patients than the doctors. Professional management of teaching hospitals is essential, Dr. Ballal said.H. Vinod Bhat Vice Chancellor of Manipal University said that teaching hospitals should look for avenues to generate revenue so as to reduce health care costs.
