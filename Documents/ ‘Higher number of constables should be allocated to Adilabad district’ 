Whether the stress laid by the State government and the Police Department on visible policing has translated into effective policing is a moot point. But, the incidence of crime have not seen a downward trend in the year gone by despite some important changes having been brought about in policing in Adilabad.The government has started the process of recruiting police constables in the State – 1,193 will be posted here, which will slightly decrease the gap in the existing police to people ratio at one policeman for 1,000 people, but it will be nowhere near the ideal one policeman for 568 people as recommended by the Bureau of Police Research and Development.“Yes, for civil policing to be effective it is necessary that the government allocates more posts of constables to this backward district,” opined a retired police, who had served in the eastern side of the district, on conditions of anonymity. “The number of policemen used for security duties is also quite astounding, which leaves fewer of them to discharge their actual duties,” he added, pointing towards a relatively lesser known fact.As many as 555 of the 1,800 strong civil constabulary are used as gunmen to Divisional Superintendents of Police, Inspectors and Sub Inspectors of Police, besides discharging sentry duty at police stations and DSP offices.Of the 1,100 Armed Reserve constabulary, over 170 are used for protecting VIPs like the two Ministers, 8 MLAs and other politically appointed functionaries in the district and police officers of Additional SP rank and above. These constables also protect the AR headquarters at Adilabad and Bellampalli and form escort for prisoners.The current process envisages recruitment of 157 civil constables, including 51 women, 185 AR constables, including 18 women, 208 constables for Gudipeta battalion of Telangana State Special Police, and 595 constables for the yet to be formed special police battalion at Adilabad town. With such few personnel getting inducted into the police force in the district, the efficiency level may not see much change, agreed another police officer.“The government can increase the number of posts, as the police force is an earning wing of the government these days,” the officer, providing rationale for allocation of more number of constable posts in the district, said.“The current earning by way of imposing fines on errant vehicle drivers stands at Rs. 3 crore, which is roughly a month’s salary bill of the police department in the district,” he added.
