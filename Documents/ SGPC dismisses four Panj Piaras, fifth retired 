The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee on Friday dismissed four of the Panj Piaras (Sikh preachers) and declared fifth as retired.The dismissal is seen as retaliatory as on last Monday the Panj Piaras had asked the SGPC to remove the Jathedars of the five Takhts by January 1.On December 28, taking strong exception to the non-implementation of their earlier Gurmata (religious edict) issued on October 23, the Panj Piaras said they would announce the future course of action for the Sikh community on January 2 next unless the SGPC removed the Jathedars by January 1.In a written statement issued to the media, SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar described all the Panj Piaras as “paid employees” and said the four employees were dismissed for “grossly violating” the service rules as well as Sikh religious norms and tenets.Bhai Satnam Singh, Bhai Satnam Singh, Bhai Tarlok Singh and Bhai Mangal Singh were dismissed, Mr. Makkar said while the fifth employee Bhai Major Singh was retired on Thursday.However, the SGPC has not mentioned any disciplinary action against retired Panj Piara.Mr. Makkar said that Panj Piaras were highly respected in the SGPC as well as in Sikh religion but at the same time they were also the “paid employees” of the SGPC whereupon they couldn’t be supposed to “violate” religious service rules.He said that these Panj Piaras while “misusing their religious authorities have thrown challenge before highest Sikh temporal seat ‘Akal Takhat’ as well as sitting Jathedar of Akal Takhat Gyani Gurbachan Singh.”Mr. Makkar said that they had hatched “deep rooted conspiracy” to extend damage to the supreme authority of the Takht.He said that if Panj Piaras were announcing religious decision as per their own choice especially against the sitting Jathedar Akal Takht it would create mess and severe restlessness among the Sikh community, hence such activities would never be tolerated and to be snubbed forthwith.Earlier on October 21, the Panj Piaras had in an unprecedented move challenged the working of the Sikh clergy and summoned the five Sikh high priests, including the Jathedar Akal Takht Gyani Gurbachan Singh, on October 23 to explain the pardon extended to the Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and later withdrawing the same. -PTIThe Panj Piaras are “paid employees”, says SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar
