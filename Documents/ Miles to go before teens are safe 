The city seems to be getting frequent reminders of the consequences of lack of awareness among its young citizens on how to remain safe on social media and while using smart-phones.If it were the large number of complaints of online abuse, mostly on social networking sites and via emails, that prompted the City police to launch a campaign on online safety last year, another negative spinoff, once again emphasising on the need for more care on such aspects, emerged just before last year ended.This was in the form of five cases registered in two months, in connection with school girls being trapped, allegedly with help from senior students, by men who then exploited them.The incidents have prompted the City police to launch yet another campaign, ‘Save A Teenager’, which revolves mostly around awareness sessions in schools. However, whether these will be enough to keep the city’s students, not just girls but the entire lot safe, remains to be seen.The reason being that awareness among the young ones will not be enough. Parents and teachers too need to be made aware, as former City Commissioner H. Venkatesh pointed out, while launching the campaign. And he was only echoing what the online safety campaign stressed on – the need for continuous monitoring and guiding from parents and teachers as the young generation starts to surf the net and use smart-phones.Like Deputy Commissioner K. Sanjay Kumar Gurudin said in his booklet on online safety, many parents rush into buying the latest gadgets for their young ones, but forget telling them about safe use. A note of caution while using even apps like WhatsApp is crucial, as investigation into the five cases mentioned above have indicated that it was using such apps that the girls were drawn into a trap comprising drugs, sexual abuse, and alcohol.The method of gangs was to trap school girls was to befriend them, keep in touch through social media , and then getting the girls to bunk classes.A step-by-step introduction to drugs and alcohol follows, before the friendly approach takes a twist with dashes of blackmailing thrown in as sexual abuse comes in. The incidents came to light only by chance, when two girls were found in an intoxicated condition. A concerted effort, involving everyone with stakes in the safety of the city’s children, might help.(Reporting by Dennis Marcus Mathew)
