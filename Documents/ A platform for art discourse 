The fledgling artists’ collective Kalakakshi – which gained currency in Kochi’s socio-political life through its association with the ‘People Against Fascism’ meet and the protests led against police hubris and moral policing – has launched a platform for art discourse called ‘Opener’ with a presentation by Ukrainian conceptual photo artist Nina Hilitukha, a travel blogger and a member of the National Society of Photo Artists of Ukraine.A former photojournalist with a German information service, Hilitukha took to artistic photo projects with fellow shutterbug and husband, Dytro Gilitukha around the time the Ukrainian revolution erupted in early 2014.Fighting the odds in Kiev, where photography is looked upon as a poor cousin of art, she went about researching the relationship between couples to see if they connected well.“I wanted to find out whether couples spending more time together also developed a likeness in behaviour and appearance. In all, 80 couples were chosen as examples to confirm or disprove this idea. The main thing for me was to make young people think of strong relations and take a serious approach to family building,” she said. Hilitukha’s photo-installation, ‘Our War’ had its roots in the tension gripping Ukraine in the wake of its conflict with Russia. On an eight-month tour of the world, the couple will be in Fort Kochi till April.
