A court here has sentenced a person to life imprisonment for murdering a woman.According to prosecution, T. Thangaraj (52) of Aralvoimozhi in Kanyakumari district used to harass and quarrel with his wife Sundari. When she sought the help of her relative Ganapathi of Panagudi, the latter pacified Thangaraj, who suspected that Ganapathi was the reason behind the ongoing domestic quarrel.Agitated over this, Thangaraj, accompanied by his relatives Perumal and Esakki, went to the house of Ganapathi on December 8, 2001 and attacked him. When his wife Shanthi tried to save her husband, she was stabbed to death.As Perumal and Esakki went underground even as the trial was going on, the case was bifurcated and Fourth Additional Sessions Court Judicial Magistrate Gladson Tagore sentenced Thangaraj to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 on Monday.
