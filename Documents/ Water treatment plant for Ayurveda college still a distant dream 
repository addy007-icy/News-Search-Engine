: A water treatment plant, which was said to be important to make ground water resources usable at the Government Ayurveda Medical College, Tripunithura, continues to be a distant project. Every summer, the college and hospital face severe water shortage.Last year, the ladies hostel was closed down because of contaminated water being supplied in the hostel when the piped water through the Kerala Water Authority was also negligible.The quantity of piped water has improved with 15,000 litres available every alternate day for the canteen, kitchen, pharmacy and coolers. However, the bathrooms in the medical college and hospital have to depend on the low quality water found in the five wells in the medical college premises. The high iron content and turbidity make the water unsuitable for washing and cleaning. To add to this, the rainwater harvest sump which has a capacity of 2 lakh litres, now has water only about half the capacity.T.K. Uma, principal, Government Ayurveda College, told The Hindu , that the process for e-tendering the treatment plant is on. Since KWA had refused to take up the project of setting up a treatment plant, a private agency had conducted a pilot test with success. However, the government has to take the e-tendering route since the agency is not enlisted.Dr. Uma said that except for the water shortage, the medical college had taken many steps in being self sufficient in meeting its needs. Two biogas plants take care of the organic waste generated and also provide gas for the kitchen and pharmacy besides lighting up the front of the hospital. Setting up of two incinerators, all other wastes generated in the medical college and hospital is also taken care of inside the premises, she added.
