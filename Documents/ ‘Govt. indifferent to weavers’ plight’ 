YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday accused the government of being indifferent to the plight of farmers and weavers in Anantapur district. He was speaking on the first day of his Rythu Bharosa Yatra in the district on Wednesday.Mr. Reddy, who earlier flew to Bangalore from Hyderabad, was received by party leaders from the district. He later proceeded to Dharmavaram where he kick-started his Rythu Bharosa Yatra. The Yatra will be on for a week and extended if need be, according to YSRC sources.Starting off from the house of a weaver, Ramesh, of YSR Colony in Dharmavaram, who had committed suicide recently owing to debts, Mr. Reddy said the plight of weavers was particularly bad owing to “the government’s failure to keep its promise to clear the debts of the community”.He also wanted to know if the government had initiated steps to take care of the children of Ramesh, soon after whose death, his wife Rama Devi also committed suicide.He also visited the house of another weaver, Kappala Narayana Swamy, of the same colony in Dharmavaram who had also committed suicide owing to debts.After interacting with the family members of the deceased weaver, Mr. Reddy said more than 22 weavers had committed suicide since the TDP government came to power, while hundreds of families had migrated for work to metropolitan cities. “What has the government done to save the handloom weavers of Anantapur district and across the State? In the face of competition from power looms, these weavers face an existential crisis and need to be supported fully,” Mr. Reddy said.
