The Madurai chapter of Young Indians (YI), in collaboration with Aravind Eye Hospitals, has launched ‘I / Eye Give,’ a campaign to create awareness of eye donation.The organisers said that though the situation had improved over the years, there was still need for awareness as the number of people who pledge their eyes should be much higher. They said that many people who had undergone surgeries for cataract and glaucoma or those who wear spectacles falsely presumed that they could not donate eyes. Eye pledging camps would be organised in at least six locations in the city later this week to get a large number of people pledge their eyes, irrespective of their age.According to YI, the campaign would be continued for the next two years with the intent of getting a considerable number of people to pledge their eyes. They said that an online form made available at the Aravind Eye Care System website could also be used to get the eyes pledged in minutes.
