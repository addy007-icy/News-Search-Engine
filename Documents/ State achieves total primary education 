Consequent to the implementation of the ‘Athulyam’ scheme by the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority, Kerala has become the first State to achieve total primary education. The Statewide declaration to this effect would be done by Vice President Hamid Ansari, here, on January 13.This was stated on Monday by Education Minister P.K. Abdu Rabb at a press conference here.The second phase of the Athulyam project was implemented as part of the Mission 676 of the State government. The scheme targeted those between ages 15 and 50 who, for one reason or the other, dropped out of the formal education process. The learners were identified through surveys conducted by the Anganwadis under the department and social welfare and ward-level surveys conducted by the ‘preraks’ in the continuing education centres, he said.As many as 2,40,804 learners were so identified and classes and allied training programmes were organised for them. As many as 2,05,913 persons wrote the ‘Aksharotsavam’ examinations held on June 7, 2015. Of these 2,02,862 persons passed; a pass percentage of 98.52. Among the successful candidates, 1,71.024 were women; 36,590 belonged to the Scheduled Castes category; and 10,717 to the Scheduled Tribes category. While 2,806 Tamil learners passed the examinations from Kollam, Idukki and Palakkad districts, 1,542 Kannada learners from Kasaragod cleared the examinations. Among those who wrote the equivalency tests were 141 inmates from different jails in Kerala. A local body could claim to have achieved ‘total primary education’ if over 90 percent of the population cleared the equivalency test.The first phase of the Athulyam programme commenced in 2010 and targeted 140 panchayats. The fourth standard equivalency programme commenced 10 years prior to this. The programme was initiated in Nilambur and Chelambra grama panchayats in Malappuram district and at the Payyannur municipality in Kannur district. Subsequently Payyannur and Nilambur got the distinction of being the first local bodies in the country to attain total primary education. In 2001, Kannur became the first district to achieve total primary education.Governor to preside over eventGovernor P.
