The Delhi government’s proposal to change the mode of cash payment for electricity bills has received flak from different stakeholders.While the government plans to re-direct cash payments on bills by making it only through public sector banks, electricity workers in the Capital have raised serious objections claiming the it wil render as many as 700 of them jobless.According to sources, the government has approached the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on the issue and the power regulator has already held a preliminary meeting with discoms on the subject.Opposing the proposal, the Delhi State Electricity Workers Union (DSEWU) called the move “short-sighted”.“Around 700 employees are responsible for cash collection across the three discoms. If cash collect at discom offices is banned, it will render them jobless. Their livelihoods will be impacted. Many of them are the sole earning members in their families,” said DSEWU general secretary Kuldeep Kumar.The union also said that if the plan is passed, the banks will have to put in place special counters for the same.Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) across the Capital have given mixed reactions to the proposal.“Around 50 per cent of discoms consumers make payment through cash at conveniently-located cash payment centres and agencies like EasyBill, which are practically next door for a consumer. On the other hand, bank branches of PSU banks are not always conveniently-located,” said a United RWA member.As per the DERC guidelines, cash payment can be done for electricity bills of up to Rs.4,000 only.Delhi has about 50 lakh discom consumers, of which 25 lakh pay via cash.“If 25 lakh consumers have to visit bank branches, it means that over one lakh consumers visiting the banks every day, which will greatly stress the already-stretched PSU banking infrastructure. Banks will be unable to cater to them fully,” he added.On the other hand, Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Association (CONRWA) secretary general Chetan Sharma said the move will come as a huge relief for Delhiites, as the government will be able to keep a tab on the amount paid by users.Electricity workers in the Capital have raised serious objections claiming the it wil render as many as 700 of them jobless
