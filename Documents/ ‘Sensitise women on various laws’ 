State Women Commission Chairperson, Tripurana Venkataratnam, said that social activists, women organisations, and NGOs should play a key role on sensitising women on various laws and rights related to them in rural parts of the State. Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day workshop on ‘Women Empowerment- Rights, Laws and Polices’, she said most of the women living in rural parts had no knowledge on laws, rights and policies related to them which was seen as a main hurdle in their development. Ms. Venkataratnam said that Anganwadi workers, NGOs and citizens should play an important part in eradicating child marriages in Nalgonda district.
