Senior leadership of the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal on Wednesday jointly addressed a press conference on one of the most politically charged issues of the State — the chit fund scam.Under the banner of the Chit Fund Sufferers Unity Forum, senior CPI (M) leader and head of the party’s labour wing, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Shyamal Chakraborty, former MP Sujan Chakraborty and Congress leader Abdul Mannan questioned both the Mamata Banerjee government in the State and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for “slowing down” the investigation.On the recent remarks made by Kshiti Goswami, State secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, a Left Front constituent, that the Congress is “not a secular party”, Mr. Chakraborty said the Congress was not “a communal party.”“I don’t think the RSP considers the Congress a communal party…even during the Emergency, when our leaders were in jail, we did not call the Congress communal.”He also said that the announcement of candidate list would be made in consultation with the other parties who come together to defeat the Trinamool Congress.
