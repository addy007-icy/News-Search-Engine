Chocolate boy Madhavan is back in action with Irudhi Suttru, an action film that shows him in a fierce and angry avatar.The film also launches newcomer Ritika Singh, who plays the role of an angry fisherwoman. The audio release of the film, which has music by Santhosh Narayanan, was held recently, with the screening of two trailers and a couple of songs.At a press meet post the launch, director Sudha Kongara said, “Maddy has been preparing for this role since 2012. He has had a leg injury, and had to go through surgery during the process of the film. Ritika Singh, an international kick boxer, has played her part beautifully as well.”A lot of research seems to have gone into this project. Elaborates the filmmaker, “I researched for about two-and-a-half years, by speaking to many athletes, to know their stories. The result of putting together all the research material got this story to where it is now.”Irudhi Suttru, or Saala Khadoos in Hindi, did take a lot of time to get completed. Explaining the delay, Sudha says, “There were about eight-10 days shooting left in 2014, but Madhavan had to get to the sets of Tanu Weds Manu Returns as he had a prior commitment there. After that, we had to wait for about four months for his beard to grow, so that the look would be the same throughout the film.”Debutante Ritika Singh spoke briefly, “I don’t know Tamil, but I can understand a few sentences. Shooting for a film has been a great experience; facing cameras was very new to me. It is new even now!”
