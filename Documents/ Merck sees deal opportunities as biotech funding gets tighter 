U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co is eager to do deals to bring in promising experimental medicines and believes a recent correction in biotechnology stocks should throw up new opportunities.“Prices have come back somewhat. That is a positive thing,” Chief Executive Kenneth Frazier told Reuters in Davos. “In particular, some of the early-stage companies are struggling to get the next round of financing as people start to be a little less willing to pay for the promise of growth, so that gives us opportunities.”Frazier said he was looking for small and medium-sized “bolt-on” deals to bring in new drugs, although such transactions could still be sizeable.
