The Forest and Wildlife Department has installed thermal imaging cameras inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS), a major habitat of Asiatic elephants and tigers in the country, to monitor their movements.A thermal imaging camera, also called thermographic camera, is a device that forms an image using infrared radiation, similar to a common camera that forms an image using visible light.“With the help of a thermal imaging camera, the forest personnel will be able to monitor animals after sunset. The camera will help officials find animals at night as well as during day,” says P. Dhanesh Kumar, warden in charge, WWS.The cameras, imported from Israel for Rs.2.5 lakh each, make extremely small temperature differences visible. Based on these temperature differences, they create a clear image. So it is easy to identify the presence of poachers from kilometres away, he says.Thermal imaging cameras are widely used by professional documentary makers worldwide. The camera would help the forest personnel in night patrolling and identifying the presence of crop-raiding animals to take preventive measures in advance. It also helps identify forest fire incidence from faraway places as it has a long range, Mr. Dhaneshkumar says. “We are planning to install more such cameras in the future,” he adds.A similar camera has been installed at the Aralam sanctuary in Kannur.Principal Chief Forest Conservator G. Harikumar commissioned the camera and demonstrated its functioning to the officials of the sanctuary recently.
