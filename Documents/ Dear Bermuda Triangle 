Oh! Dear Bermuda TriangleWhy are you so rude?Not allowing our people, to travel over you.Oh! Dear Bermuda Triangle,You are also apart of the Atlantic Ocean.Do you send the UFOs,Which have been seen by our pilots?Oh! Dear Bermuda Triangle,Why are you angry with us?Devouring people’s lives,Or removing them from your path.Oh! Dear Bermuda TriangleWhy don’t you get a good name for yourself?Or did you make any mistake?Due to which god gave you supernatural powers?Oh! Dear Bermuda TriangleCan you return our planes, people, boats and ships?If you could try to become a good part of the sea,Please break the eternal mystery.S.Amritha, V, Vanshi Manthan Vidyashram, Chennai
