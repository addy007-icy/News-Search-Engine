Writer and social activist Sara Joseph has resigned as State convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).She is understood to have tendered her resignation in October based on her stand that a new team of office- bearers should be elected to lead the State party. Although one section of the party leadership had concurred with her position, a rival section had taken exception to it. She, however, told reporters here on Saturday that she had no differences with AAP leaders.Ms. Joseph, who had made strong interventions in several social and political issues in the State, has been the most visible face of the party in Kerala. She had polled the highest number of votes for the party in the 2014 Lok Sabha election in Thrissur.â€” Special Correspondent
