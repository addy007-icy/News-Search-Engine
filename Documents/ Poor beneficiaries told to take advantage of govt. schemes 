Pramod Madhwaraj, MLA, said on Friday that the State government had waived loans of 543 beneficiaries under the Nagara Ashraya housing scheme in Udupi city, amounting to Rs. 2.82 crore.He was speaking after distributing certificates of loan waiver to Nagara Ashraya beneficiaries, who had taken loans under the scheme from 1993-94 to 2002-03, at a function organised at the Town Hall, here.Mr. Madhwaraj said that most of the poor beneficiaries of the scheme had no knowledge that they had to repay the loan. As the loan remained unpaid, their land records had the word loan beneficiary mentioned in them. With this, they were unable to get any new loans.He had raised this issue with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at the legislature party meeting recently and had urged him to waive the loans under the scheme. The government waived loan amounting to Rs. 2,200 crore under the scheme in the entire State.Arrangements would soon be made to delete the word loan beneficiary in the land records of those who had received the certificates of loan waiver.With this, these poor beneficiaries would be eligible for loans under other schemes. In the last two and a half years, below poverty line (BPL) cards had been distributed to about 11,000 persons in Udupi Assembly constituency. This had helped the poor people get facilities provided by the government. But the BPL card holders should be aware that they would lose their BPL status if their electricity bill increased beyond Rs. 450 per month.Poor people who had illegally built their houses on government lands to regularise them under Section 94CC of Revenue Act, Mr. Madhwaraj said.P. Yuvaraj, president of the Udupi City Municipal Council, presided over the function.
