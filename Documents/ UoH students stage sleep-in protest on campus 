Five research scholars of University of Hyderabad, who were expelled from their hostels for allegedly being part of a fight between two student outfits, have started living at a popular haunt on the campus as a mode of protest.The research scholars are staging their indefinite sleep-in protest with the support of other student outfits on campus including Students Federation of India, National Students Union, Dalit Students Union, Ambedkar Students Union, Students Islamic Organisation, Telangana Vidyarthi Vedika, Tribal Students Front and Pehel among other outfits.All the expelled students are from 800-cadre strong Ambedkar Students Association. As per a release issued jointly by all students’ organisations, “a strong recommendation from BJP Union Minister Bandaru Dattatrya and subsequent communications from MHRD on the incidents related to Ambedkar Students Association vs Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad on August 3, 2015 has caused social ostracisation and boycott of five Dalit Research Scholars of UoH. Four of these Dalit Research Scholars are sons of agricultural labourers, one among them doesn’t have parents to support him. And another has submitted his Ph.D,” read the read.An order issued by the UoH authorities earlier this month had asked the students to vacate their hostels, not to gather in groups in public places on UoH campus and also not to contest in student union elections. Enraged students said they will continue their sleep-in protest as they have no means to sustain their stay outside the campus. The University of Hyderabad authorities had earlier explained that students were expelled based on the decision taken by a sub-committee of the Executive Council.
