A weekly column on what celebrities are reading and planning to read. This week we have Rammanohar Reddy and Sadia Dehvli.Sadia Dehlvi   Among the books I am reading currently are: From MTV to Mecca: How Islam Inspired My Life by Kristiane Backer, Pigeons of the Domes: Stories on Communalism, edited by Rakhshanda Jalil, Me and Rumi: The Autobiography of Shams-i Tabrizi, translated by William C. Chittick, and The Age of Wrath: A History of the Delhi Sultanate by Abraham Eraly.(Sadia Dehlvi is an author and columnist.)Rammanohar Reddy:I read more than one book at a time. At the moment I am reading three books: Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, Adam Sisman’s John le Carre: The Biography and Marlon James’s A Brief History of Seven Killings.I had chanced upon Bryson’s book on Shakespeare long ago and I was amazed at how accessible he had made Shakespeare. His style is engaging and A Short History... is very well-researched. The biography of le Carre is huge. I’ve been a fan of le Carre for 30-40 years now, so I picked up this book.I picked up Marlon James even before it won the Man Booker Prize. It had received great reviews and I had heard good things about it. It’s written in a very unusual style. This is the book I pick up every time I want to unwind.(C. Rammanohar Reddy is the editor of Economic and Political Weekly.)
