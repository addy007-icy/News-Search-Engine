Murugan, taking charge as its first Inspector General of Police (IGP).The new range is carved out of the North Eastern Police Range in Kalbaburagi for administrative convenience.Ballari district, which was earlier part of the Eastern Range in Davangere, was merged with North Eastern Range after being tagged to the Hyderabad-Karnatak region.Mr. Murugan will function from the office of the Superintendent of Police until all necessary infrastructure facilities, including building to house the new office, were provided.Till then, the old building in the District Police Office compound, which was earlier the office of Superintendent of Police, is vacant and might be allotted, as an adhoc arrangement, to set up the office of IGP.However, currently a month was needed to give a face lift and equip the building with required furniture and fittings.Speaking to presspersons immediately after taking charge said that his thrust was to make policing people-friendly and sought the cooperation of the public for its success.
