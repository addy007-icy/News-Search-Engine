What does an art form that has fallen into a rut sound like? Probably like the morning sounds of birds chirping, bells ringing and crackers bursting. These were some of the sounds that were oft-repeated at the venue of the mimicry competitions at the State School Arts Festival.Mimicry, once a favourite item for the arts festival crowd, still draws people in large numbers, but over the past few years, it has given them only disappointment, barring a few exceptions.Similar tricksThe competition for High School girls on Wednesday was filled with repetition of similar tricks, and at times similar introductory speeches, by participant after participant. The judges choosing to award just three students with ‘A’ grades was a reflection on the lack of quality in the competition.But there were flashes of brilliance, most notably from N. Raveena of G.G. Model GHSS, Chalappuram, Kozhikode, who came first. It was the second consecutive win for the Class 10 girl. She had the crowd in splits by successfully imitating political leaders and others who are hard to imitate, like Education Minister P.K. Abdu Rabb and Governor P. Sasthasivam. M. Binsha from D.H.O. HSS in Pookkarathara of Malappuram district stood out with her ability to make two distinct sounds at the same time.
