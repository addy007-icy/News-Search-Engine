Former Minister Baswaraju Saraiah and DCC president N. Rajender Reddy warned the people of Warangal against believing Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s promises. The Congress leaders said the Chief Minister made the promise of underground drainage in Warangal before the general elections and again made the same promise two times so far. The promise of Textile park was also a old one, they said.“The Chief Minister wants to gain political mileage in ensuing municipal elections in Warangal, and showering all the promises old and new. Not a single promise came through till date,” they alleged. Mr. Saraiah said the Chief Minister laid foundation for two-bedroom houses in Deendayal Nagar slum in Warangal last year. Except foundation stone, nothing was made there so far. No politician can go on fooling people.The Chief Minister crossed the limits and still trying to fool people of Warangal, he said. “Can people believe if he says Devadula water will be filled up in Ramappa and other tanks? The project is pending for want of funds. The Chief Minister is aware of it and still wants people to believe him,” Mr Saraiah pointed out. The Kakatiya festival that was supposed to be conducted every year is pending since a long time.Mr. KCR during his last year visit said they would be held in a grand manner, and immediately after going to Hyderabad he was to hold a meeting and release funds. “What happened to the Kakatiya festival?” he asked.
