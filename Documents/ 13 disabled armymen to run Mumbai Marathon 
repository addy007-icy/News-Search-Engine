Thirteen war disabled retired army personnel will participate in the Mumbai Marathon on Sunday.Their participation will be coordinated by the NGO War Wounded Foundation and administrative support will be provided by the Headquarter, Maharashtra Gujarat and Goa Area of the Army. They will run with the objective of improving awareness among the people of a large community of war disabled personnel.Leading the team would be Lieutenant General Vijay Oberoi (retd), who as a young Captain lost his right leg in the 1965 war with Pakistan. Despite his disability, he rose steadily in the Army, and retired as Vice Chief of Army Staff in 2001. Also participating would be Major general Ian Cardozo, who was part of the Indian Army’s first heli-borne operation in the 1971 war. He was injured in a mine blast. Enemy artillery fire had destroyed the battlion’s medical facilities, and hence Cardozo had to amputate his own leg using a khukri. He rose to the rank of Major general and served as the chairman of the Rehabilitation Council from 2009 to 2014.
