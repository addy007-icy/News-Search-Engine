The new ‘score one, get two’ rule for field goals in the Hockey India League (HIL) may sound like an end-of-the-season-sale offer, but it has caught the imagination of the coaches and players even before its implementation.The novel rule, which is expected to encourage more field goals, will draw a lot of attention when Kalinga Lancers and Uttar Pradesh Wizards lock horns in the opening match of the fourth edition of the event at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Monday.Some of the penalty strokes resulting in two goals will also provide some twist to the matches.Delhi Waveriders coach Cedric D’Souza points out that the rule favouring field goals will make matches visually attractive.“It will make the game more tactical. Coaches will have to think out of the box and make sure that they try and plan for the unexpected,” says D’Souza.Uttar Pradesh Wizards captain V.R. Raghunath, despite being a penalty corner specialist, feels that the two-goal rule should make the HIL thrilling. “The first week of the season is going to be critical in deciding the way forward for all the teams.“The rule changes only add to the excitement of the league.”Solid unitLast year's semifinalist Wizards, coached by Roger van Gent, seems to be ready for the challenge. With experienced Australian Jamie Dwyer, the costliest Indian player Akashdeep Singh (who is among the International Hockey Federation (FIH) nominations for the ‘Young player of the year’ award), attacking midfielder Agustin Mazilli of Argentina and Indian talents like Ramandeep Singh, P.R. Aiyappa and Jaskaran Singh at its disposal, the team looks solid upfront.Raghunath, Dutch professional Wouter Jolie and Argentine drag-flicker Gonzalo Peillat can defend well, whereas the steady P.R. Sreejesh can be relied upon under the bar.The accomplished Tobias Hauke and Edward Ockenden can ensure a fluent job in the midfield.Lancers, coached by Mark Hager, will seek inspiration from charismatic German midfielder Moritz Fuerste.The host has employed some Indian forwards, such as Devinder Walmiki, Lalit Upadhyay, Stanli Minz and Malak Singh, who will perform in the company of experienced Aussie Glenn Turner.Englishman Adam Dixon and Dutchman Quirijin Caspers and the Indian duo of S.K. Uthappa and Dharamvir Singh have the ability to switch positions between midfield and forwardline.With Andrew Charter protecting the Lancers goal, young Indians Dipsan Tirkey, Pardeep Mor, Amit Rohidas, Gurjinder Singh, Anand Lakra and their overseas colleagues in Matthew Willis, Matthew Dawson and Aran Zalewski will try to form an impregnable wall for Lancers.Different centresThe remaining teams will play their first matches through the week at different centres.Defending champion Ranchi Rays has again chosen a strong midfield, predominantly consisting of Australian and English players, whereas last year’s finalist Jaypee Punjab Warriors has mostly stuck to Aussies in the backline and middle.DWR, which had finished third in 2015, has foreign players of varied nationalities, while Dabang Mumbai has picked up a nicely-balanced squad.With all the teams looking competitive, the fourth chapter of the HIL, with a total cash prize of Rs. 5.7 crores, should present an interesting fare.
