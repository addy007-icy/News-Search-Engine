In an all-PSPB affair, Anthony Amalraj and Manika Batra clinched the men’s and women’s crowns of the senior National table tennis championships at the Kotla Vijay Bhaskara Reddy indoor stadium on Sunday. Amalraj subdued Gnanasekharan Sathiyan 11-5, 7-11, 11-7, 8-11, 11-4, 11-9 and Manika Batra staved off a stiff challenge from Pooja Sahasrabuddhe 11-3, 8-11, 11-8, 3-11, 11-7, 7-11, 14-12.It was Amalraj’s second title, and he was exultant as ever in his hour of triumph but more subdued in his expression of joy than when he won in Lucknow. It was a truly commendable show from young Sathiyan, tiding over the tragedy of his father’s demise around the time of the East Zone national ranking tournament about two months ago.“I am obviously happy to win my second title,” said Amalraj. “It was a 50-50 game and both of us had our chances. I am a bit stronger mentally and played better today,” said the Chennai native when looking back on the showpiece of the tournament.“He was just awesome. I’ve played him four times recently but haven’t been able to beat him. But they have been close matches,” said Sathiyan, quite composed despite being deprived of the title for the second time after missing out to Soumyajith Ghosh in Puducherry in the last edition. “He (Amalraj) produces those big points to surge ahead but I am hopeful I will beat him,” said the engineering graduate.Sathiyan had enough reason to cherish this championship though. “It was a dream to beat Sharath Kamal. He is such a fantastic player. I think he was caught off guard as he hadn’t played me for some time. I had nothing to lose so I played freely and that paid off,” said the youngster, who is coached by former National champion S. Raman.The results:Men: Final: Anthony Amalraj (PSPB) bt G.
