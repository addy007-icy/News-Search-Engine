The violation of zoning laws with unbridled proliferation of residential layouts in industrial areas has come to haunt industries in Mysuru as the new residents have complained of “increase in pollution” and want the factories to shift to a different location.This is also fallout of speculators in real estate purchasing land in industrial area and reselling it to developers to reap a profit, even as potential entrepreneurs and local industries are struggling to secure land for expansion. But the local residents, some of whom have complained to the authorities of increase in pollution, will have no reprieve as pollution parameters are higher in designated industrial areas.Suresh Kumar Jain of the Mysore Industries Association (MIA) told The Hindu that having constructed houses in industrial layouts, which itself is a violation of the law, the residents want the factories to relocate.In the Metagalli industrial area, schools, engineering colleges, management institutes, choultries apart from luxury hotels, have been constructed in the recent past. But its impact is on industrial activity, besides residents of the layouts, as they will be exposed to health hazards.The issue has been brought to fore by the officials of Mysore Polymers & Rubber Products Ltd., at Metagalli, who have drawn attention of the MIA of the problems caused by KIADB-allotted industrial land being converted into residential areas or converted for commercial use.M. Vijay Kumar, Deputy Managing Director of the company, said flouting of norms in allocation of lands is causing tremendous inconvenience to the already existing and new coming industries because the environment protection norms and the expectations of people are different for industry and residential areas. This leads to a lot of complaints to KSPCB and other authorities by vested interests perhaps with ulterior motives, he said.Citing an example, the complainant pointed out that a member of the Sree Chamundeshwari Railway Badavane Nagareeka Hitha Rakshana Samithi representing the local residential area, which was only a few meters away from Metagalli Industrial Plots, was repeatedly complaining to the KSPCB and other authorities since the last two years. “The complaint was found to be incorrect as per tests conducted by the authorities but such frequent complaints take considerable time of industries, whose major function is to manufacture high quality products at competitive prices and contribute their mite to the society,” said Mr. Kumar.
