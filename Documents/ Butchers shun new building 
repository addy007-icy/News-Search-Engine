: The butchers of Kaloor have refused to move into the newly constructed building of the slaughterhouse citing technical hazards. The representatives of the butchers have complained that the slippery floor of the new building has made the operations difficult at the Corporation-owned building there. The local body had spenT around Rs. 25 lakh and installed the required machinery there. The local body had also provided the waste management facilities as suggested by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. However, the move to shift the operations to the new building was stalled following the non-cooperation of the butchers.Incidentally, the Board had earlier slapped a closure notice on the unit as it failed to meet the pollution control standards. The local body has received an inspection report from the veterinary officer. The local body will bring in the necessary modifications for making the new building operational, said V.K. Minimol, chairperson of the Health Standing Committee of the Corporation.
