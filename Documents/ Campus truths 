The article, “Discrimination on the campus” (Jan.26), reveals the bitter truth — even decades after Independence, our society is unable to shed casteism. Even if there are laws against caste discrimination, people’s minds still operate in the casteist mode, which is why the so-called lower castes are not a part of the mainstream. Institutions of higher education need to take up the challenge of integrating Dalit students in every manner.Maya Hemant Bhatkar,MumbaiThe fact that students and teachers from historically marginalised and oppressed classes continue to go grossly underrepresented even in duly elected representative bodies also shows us the limitations of electoral-democratic processes in the context of a structurally inegalitarian society. It draws attention to the need to continue and strengthen social justice policies by the state. I can add to the example the writer has cited about ragging. While the incidence of corporal punishment in schools has come down, there still prevails a certain sentiment among adults, including a section of teachers, in its favour.Firoz Ahmad,New DelhiEven after more than six decades of Independence, India is still in the grip of casteism.Without an iota of doubt, we can boldly say that Dalit children face discrimination everywhere. Even in schools these children suffer for no fault of theirs. A few months ago, in Tamil Nadu, a school teacher was found making Dalit children clean the school’s toilets. It only shows that many of our academic professionals harbour casteist feelings. Dalit research scholars are discriminated against and alienated. How can we call ourselves a vibrant society then? While there is much talk about the need to abolish the quota system, the fact is that the downtrodden continue to suffer.T. Anand Raj,Chennai
