The State Cabinet on Wednesday decided to cash in on the proposal to distribute cheques to beneficiaries of various welfare schemes by organising major functions on February 6 in all 14 districts with all elected representatives in the respective areas present.The cheques, to the tune of an estimated sum of Rs.600 crore, will be distributed to over 18 lakh beneficiaries. A segment of the beneficiaries had already received their benefits earlier through post before the entire exercise ran into a controversy.Replying to questions on the issue, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the Finance Secretary had discussions with the bank authorities. Accordingly, it was stated that 20 days’ time would be required to prepare the cheques for the beneficiaries. The Ministers who are in charge of the districts will preside over the function.The Chief Minister did not attribute any politics behind organising the mega event, but it was clear from his words that the government proposed to capture the attention it would gather. “All elected representatives, from the grama panchayat, block, district panchayat, municipalities and Corporations, will be present at the event, he said.
