The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) will recommend to the State government to take action against doctors who refuse to give treatment for prisoners who are admitted to the Thrissur Government Medical College Hospital.Addressing mediapersons after visiting the Viyyur Central prison on Tuesday, panel chairman J.B. Koshy said doctors should consider treatment for prisoners according to the urgency of the cases.“The overcrowding of prisoners is another major issue in the jail. The jail has 790 inmates against its capacity of 520. Either the facilities in the jail should be increased or some of them should be sent to other prisons. Shortage of jail employees also affects the functioning of the prison,” he noted.There are no sufficient jail staff to escort prisoners or to take them to hospital, he added. He pointed out that there are remand prisoners who could not be produced at the court for the last six or seven months, as there are no staff to take them to court.The Viyyur Central jail has two Bangladeshis and two Nigerians, who have not received permission to go to their countries even after completing their jail term. The panel will urge the government to speed up procedures to send them to their countries. The panel will request the government to release two prisoners above 80 years, considering their age.
