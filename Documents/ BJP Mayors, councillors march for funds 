: Councillors and Mayors of the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi protested against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government on Monday, accusing it of withholding funds.The councillors were to march from Rajghat to the Delhi Secretariat, where Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was, but were detained by the police near the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium. They were taken to the IP Estate police station, from where they were released after some time.Wearing black bands and shouting slogans, the councillors demanded that the corporations be given their share of funds and implement the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission (DFC), which has been pending since 2013, that gives civic bodies a bigger piece of the pie in terms of taxes.Ravinder Gupta, Mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said Mr. Kejriwal had been defying the High Court, which had ordered the government to release funds to the civic bodies.“The Chief Minister is playing politics just because the municipal elections are next year and the AAP has its eyes set on it. Delhiites had chosen AAP as trouble-shooters, but they have become troublemakers,” said Mr. Gupta.The three corporations have been plagued by financial crises for over a year now, and employees haven’t been paid for nearly four months. Apart from demanding that the Fourth DFC be implemented, the councillors said that the government should begin with releasing funds as per the Third Finance Commission.Subhash Arya, Mayor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that the corporations would be forced to extend their agitation if the government doesn’t implement the Fourth DFC.Many detained at the Indira Gandhi Stadium before they could reach Delhi Secretariat
