It is sad that the HMT watch units, “the timekeepers to the nation”, will now be closed (“Cabinet approves closure of HMT Watches”, Jan.7). Jawaharlal Nehru once called HMT the “Jewel of the nation” and the watch unit was his brainchild. It is clear that the managers failed to keep pace with the changing times. One hopes that other public sector units will not face closure in a similar manner and instead be revived.G.V. Narasimha Murthy,HyderabadIt’s sad to note that HMT watches will now be a thing of the past. There was a time when the most precious gift the common man thought of was an HMT wristwatch; schoolchildren would be motivated to perform better academically with the promise of an HMT watch. What is surprising is that the closure comes amidst a strong campaign for ‘Make in India’.Balasubramaniam Pavani,SecunderabadThe decision is short-sighted especially when mechanical and automatic watches are making a comeback. If the Bullet motorcycle was able to make a comeback in an era of high technology, why not the HMT watch?H.N. Ramakrishna,BengaluruFor an engineering student who graduated in the 1960s and the 1970s, bagging a job in any one of HMT’s factories was a dream. It is strange that many public sector units that were started soon after Independence have been allowed to fail. Is it a deliberate strategy?K.H. Krishnan,Shencottai, Tamil NaduIn the 1980s, a person who sported an HMT watch and who drove an HM Ambassador car was seen to be someone respectable. These two brands were once the identities by which Indians were known and are now a thing of the past after globalisation and the advent of imported brands. Top Indian brands should not be allowed to vanish.Tipston Rubus,Bengaluru
