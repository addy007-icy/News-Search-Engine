Unnikannan A.R. and Shifna Mariam bagged the top slots in the boys and girls events, respectively.Unnikannan, a class 9 student of Sivagiri Higher Secondary School, Varkala, was participating in the revenue district fete for the first time Listening to radio, television, and the phone and constant practice are what took him all the way to the top, he says.Unnikannan who stays at the CSI hostel for the visually challenged at Chirayinkeezhu, attributes his success to his parents Anil and Reena and sister Gayatri, teachers, and friends Sarath and Vijith. Shifna, a class 9 student of Government Model Girls Secondary School, Pattom, sings and plays the violin too but it is while doing mimicry that she is in her element. She had come second in Urdu ghazal in the sub-district fete. But it’s not been a smooth going for her. Shifna suffers from atonic bladder and needs surgery for which the family is raising funds. Her first has come as a silver lining in her cloud of troubles. — Staff ReporterTop slots in HS boys, girls sections go to visually challenged students
