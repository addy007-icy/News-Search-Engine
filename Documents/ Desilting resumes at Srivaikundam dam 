Preliminary works for desilting Srivaikundam dam, which remained suspended in the last reservoir of the Tamirabharani irrigation system after the onset of northeast monsoon in October last, has resumed.When National Green Tribunalâ€™s Southern Bench ordered desilting of the dam, the exercise commenced on June 30 last. However, it triggered protests when the contractor identified for this project started desilting deposited river sand in a place away from the dam. Only after the NGT was approached again, silt deposited close to the dam was removed. However, the exercise was stopped following the onset of northeast monsoon.
