It was appreciation and applause galore at the concert of all-time favourite Sanjay Subrahmanyan at the 64{+t}{+h}anniversary celebrations of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam here on Sunday evening. Following a varnam in Begada, Sanjay focussed on the phrase, “Palumaru Chirakalamu” for Thyagaraja's “Tulasi dala” in Mayamalavagoulai. Varadarajan on the violin warmed up to the singer’s improvisations right from the beginning. He then sang the rarely heard Dikshitar kriti in Ananda Bhairavi, “Thyagaraja Yoga Vaibavam,” at a slow pace in order to highlight the wordplay of narrowing and widening phrases in its lyrics.Listeners then got to revel in Sanjay's mastery of Mohanam whose notes flowed across the hall, uninterrupted by an unexpected power cut, for Pallavi Gopala Iyer's kriti, beginning “Srirama Ramani.” Harikumar on the mridangam played a tani in his distinctive style and was partnered in his efforts by P. L. Sudhir.Sanjay then dealt in detail with Todi for Marimuthu Pillai's “Enneramum.” Then he delved on Gangeyabhooshani for Thyagaraja's, “Evvare Ramayya.” Darbar lent itself to the singer's stylistic interpretation for ragam and tanam for the pallavi, “Satguru Malaradi.” The final songs included “Eththanai Kodi Inbam,” “Neeninaithal” and a tillana in Dwijawanti. As the fiftieth recipient of the Madura Kala Praveena, Sanjay could be counted as among the outstanding contributors to Carnatic music.
