MMTS phase II works have reached an advanced stage of execution along three corridors, railway officials said. In the corridors - Moula Ali – Ghatakesar (12.20 km), Telapur-Ramachandrapuram (5.75 km), and Bolaram-Medchal (14 km), the executing agency, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), has completed groundwork and will soon commence track laying. Following electrification and signalling, subsequent to track laying works, the Commissioner of Railway Safety has to certify the corridors for use before they can be thrown open to public. Phase II of MMTS covers 103-km., mainly involving multiplication and electrification of existing railway lines. The project’s commissioning is scheduled for the end of 2017 when it is expected to enhance the capacity of MMTS from the current 1.5 lakh passengers a day to about 5 lakh passengers.Railway officials recently met the State Government representatives to discuss airport connectivity which was originally conceived as part of the project. However, the fate of a passenger rail link to the airport continues to remains uncertain.
