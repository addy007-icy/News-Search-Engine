Abbas Culturals is organising the 24th edition of their arts festival — ‘Kalaivizha 2016’ — at Kamarajar Arangam from January 8. The festival will kick-start with Vaadavooran , an epic Tamil musical drama on Saint Manickkavasagar. The festival will have a number of classical music and theatre performances. The festival began in 1991 as a concept suggested by singer K.J. Yesudas to art patron Abbas Jayaraman with a view to bringing together musicians. The festival now features a number of performing art forms from diverse genres and also encourages emerging south Indian talent. .
