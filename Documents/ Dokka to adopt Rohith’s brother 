Seeking to put an end to the unsavoury debate over the caste of Rohith Vemula’s mother, former Minister Dokka Manikya Vara Prasad has said that he would adopt the younger brother of Rohith. “I have been approached by a close family friend who suggested that I adopt his younger brother and I have agreed,” said Mr. Vara Prasad.Hitting out against those seeking to stoke controversy over Rohith’s caste, Mr. Vara Prasad said: “How does it matter when Rohith is no more?” Mr. Vara Prasad questioned.The former Minister said that a committee be constituted to go into the reasons behind the repeated failure of students from BC/SC/ST communities in professional courses. Special care should be taken to improve their performance, he said.“Students from BC/SC/ST communities should be provided special classes to improve their English proficiency levels and a special cell should be in place in every university,” Mr. Prasad added.
