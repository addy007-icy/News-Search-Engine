Indonesian police say one of the eight men killed in the Jakarta bombings was a civilian and not one of the bombers as first thought.Jakarta police spokesman Col. Muhammad Iqbal said the civilian was suspected of involvement because he crossed the road to a traffic police post next to one of four confirmed attackers, Dian Joni Kurniadi.The victim, 43-year-old Sugito, was one of four civilians killed in the audacious attack on Thursday that targeted a Starbucks and the traffic police post in bustling central Jakarta. Sugito uses one name, like many Indonesians.Col. Iqbal told reporters on Sunday that a thorough police investigation into Sugito’s records concluded he was an ordinary resident of West Java’s Karawang city.
