The export of lace products from the International Lace Trade Centre (ILTC) will take a giant leap from the present Rs. 60 crore to Rs.500 crore in the coming five years, according to Development Commissioner (Handicrafts) K. Gopal, of Ministry of Textiles.Speaking at the Reverse Buyer, Seller Meet organised by the Export Promotion Council For Handicrafts (EPCH) at ILTC here, he said, “Narsapur in Andhra Pradesh has the largest concentration of crochet and lace artisans in the world with over 1 lakh home based women lace makers. Our capacity building, product diversification and training on competitiveness will enable us meet the target.”Over 80 per cent of the lace products are exported to the major markets of USA, Europe and Japan. The range of products exported from the region include home furnishings like table covers, table mats and napkins, cushion covers, bed spread, garments and accessories.Over 100 buyers and exporters from across the country took part in the three-day meet which was inaugurated on January 28 at the ILTC. The purpose of the meet is to provide a linkage between the local exhibitors and exporters and give exposure to lace product makers on desired value addition to the products.The traditional lace making handicraft in the region was languishing over the past decade due to lack of innovation. With the initiatives of the Ministry of Textiles, the segment started looking up over the past one and half year.The Ministry of Textiles and EPCH together invested over Rs. 15 crore on the ILTS in 2014 to give a fillip to the sector. The EPCH came up with the ILTC here with exhibition halls, auditorium, open-air theater, meeting rooms, training space, ample facilities for craft bazar, accommodation for buyers and designers beside administrative set up.All the facilities are given free of cost to the exporters and craft-makers. The EPCH has initiated skilling of over 5,000 individuals in East and West Godavari districts. The total handicrafts exports in the country stands at Rs 18,500 crore during 2014-15 and it is expected to be over Rs. 20,500 crore for the current fiscal.
