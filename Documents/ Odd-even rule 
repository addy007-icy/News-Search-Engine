The AAP government has initiated baby steps with the odd-even rule on a trial basis and a 15-day testing period to asses its impact. It is premature to conclude on its benefits (“ >Trying and testing the car formula,”Jan.12). One should give the plan a fair opportunity to succeed. In this regard, the exemption to two-wheelers and to many VIPs is baffling. I hope that this experiment encourages more citizens to use public transport and forces public authorities to make it more effective. However, as pointed out, pollution is a mixed bag of issues and not restricted only to automobile emissions.H.N. Ramakrishna,Bengaluru
