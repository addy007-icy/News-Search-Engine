The use of smart cards by commuters of the Chennai Metro Rail is on the rise and this has been triggered by an overall increase in the number of people using the services.The Chennai Metro patronage witnessed a boost after the floods last month, officials said. Though tokens are still sold out largely, six months after the first service, smart cards are now being preferred as there are people who travel more frequently than before.“After the floods, the average passenger traffic has grown from about 8,000-9,000 a day to 12,000 a day. Nowadays, we find that smart cards are beginning to sell well than earlier. For instance, 500-600 cards per station are being sold now, about 100 more than a few months ago,” an official said.The Chennai Metro Rail, built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, launched its first service between Koyambedu and Alandur — a distance of 10 km only in July 2015 after five years of work.The fare for this stretch ranges between Rs. 10 and Rs. 40 for ordinary class, and between Rs. 20 and Rs. 80 for special class.‘Common ticketing system’Months after the launch, to give a boost to patronage, they started issuing special trip cards to commuters. Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) officials said smart cards were important to encourage patronage in the city.They added that they had incorporated 12 features in the card for the convenience of commuters, including its use on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses and even in shopping malls, but this is yet to be put to use.
