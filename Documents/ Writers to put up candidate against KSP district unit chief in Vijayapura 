A newly formed forum of like-minded writers from the district has decided to field a candidate against Mallikarjun Yendigeri, three-time president of the district unit of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, in the elections to the literary body scheduled for February 28.V.C. Nagathan, veteran writer and Kannada activist, told presspersons here on Thursday that though Mr. Mallikarjun had announced that he would not contest the next election, he might not keep his word. “We urge him not to contest the election and give a chance to another candidate,” Mr. Nagathan said.He said that the forum had unanimously decided to field Mallikarjun Bruhangimath, writer and activist.“We want Mr. Bruhangimath to get elected unopposed. We tried to convince Mr. Yendigeri against contesting the election. But he did not listen to us and we had no other choice but to field a candidate against him,” he said. Accusing Mr. Yendigeri of acting like a dictator, Mr. Nagathan said that he had not done anything significant to develop Kannada and promote Kannada writers in the district. He regretted that the affairs of the parishat were being politicised and only money power worked there. “Poor writers who wish to serve Kannada can’t contest the election,” he said.Mr. Nagathan said that the State unit of the KSP should fix a tenure for district unit chiefs which would allow other aspirants to contest the elections.
