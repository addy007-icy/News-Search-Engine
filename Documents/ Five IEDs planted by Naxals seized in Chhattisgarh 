Five powerful IEDs allegedly planted by Naxals were on Monday recovered from an under-construction route in Chhattisgarhâ€™s insurgency-hit Dantewada district, police said.A joint team of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and district police recovered the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) while it was patrolling to ensure security to the under-construction Aranpur-Jagargunda road under Aranpur police station limits, Dantewada Superintendent of Police Kamlochan Kashyap told PTI.Out of the five IEDs seized, two weighed about 10 kgs each, while the others were around 5-7 kgs each, he said.The security personnel spotted electric wire connections at separate places while cordoning-off the route, following which the IEDs kept in steel vessels and hidden underground were found, thus averting a major mishap, he said.The explosives were apparently planted to harm the personnel involved in providing security to the strategically important road in the Naxal hotbed that will connect Dantewada and Sukma districts, he said.The explosives were immediately destroyed by the bomb disposal squad, he added.
