In a development that is likely to hamper the extradition process of multi-million dollar fraud accused Salim Karimi, the Esplanade Court on Monday granted him bail. Karimi is wanted in the United States for allegedly defrauding the Los Angeles civic administration to the tune of millions of dollars.Karimi, an American national of Indian origin, was detained by Immigration Authorities on December 26 while trying to board a flight to Mexico from the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, after it was discovered that the US had issued a red corner notice against him in 2015. He was subsequently handed over to the Extradition Cell of the Mumbai Police and was remanded in judicial custody while the police initiated the process of his deportation.Karimi’s lawyers, however, had applied for bail and on Monday, the Esplanade Court granted it on a personal bond of Rs 15,000. Confirming the move, Karimi’s lawyer, Abad Ponda, said, “We had argued in court that the arrest was illegal as it threw the Extradition Act to the wind. There needs to be a provisional warrant or at least an endorsed warrant against someone to be arrested under the Act.”Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Atulchandra Kulkarni could not be reached. Police sources, however, confirmed that the decision would be appealed against in the Bombay High Court.
