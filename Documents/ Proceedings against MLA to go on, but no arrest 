Lathika in connection with the incidents in the Assembly. Her complaint was that the petitioner had obstructed her inside the Assembly, touched her body, and tried to push her down.The court observed that what was essentially expected of the Assembly was law-making. But unfortunately, violence had taken place on the floor of the Assembly. The court said that mere use of force was not punishable under law.

In fact, the matter required examination in detail.
