Girls are making a mark in every field they step into. It is high time that we welcome them into our life with open arms rather than considering them a burden on the family, Minister for Women and Child Welfare and Mining Peethala Sujatha has said.Celebrating the National Girl Child Day at a programme organised by the Women Development and Child Welfare Department (WDCWD) here on Sunday, she said that the goal was to raise awareness on the importance of considering a girl child as an asset. “We need to take collective steps to stop the diminishing trend of the child sex ratio that stands 1000:961 as per the census survey in 2011. Measures should be taken to protect girls against sexual exploitation and social discrimination and work towards creating equal opportunities for them in every aspect,” the Minister said.In a move to provide a one stop solution centre to rape victims or those subjected to sexual harassment and any form of exploitation, the WDCWD is all set to open a One-Stop Crisis Centre/ Nirbhaya Centre at King George Hospital soon. “The recently-initiated unit is already working at Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. Based on the requirement of the victims, the centre will provide medical aid, police assistance, legal guidance, and counselling sessions to the victims. The idea is to provide every facility to the needy and help them recover soon without running around various departments,” says Ch. Kameswaramma, Regional Deputy Director of WDCWD.A video conference will be facilitated to those who feel reluctant to approach the police.“The places in all the districts have been identified and the centre will be put up in each district in a phased manner,” said Ms. Kameswaramma, adding that a number of departments will coordinate with them to make the new facility more effective.Students of various schools performed cultural programmes and prizes were given to those who participated in various competitions organised by the WDCWD. District Collector N. Yuvaraj, MLAs Palla Srinivas, V. Anita and Vasupalli Ganesh, NGO representatives and Department heads attended the programme.
