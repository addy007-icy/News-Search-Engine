Australia’s decision to rest Mitchell Marsh for the second One-Day match against India was questioned by former Australia captain Allan Border on Thursday.It was announced before the opening game of the series on Tuesday that Marsh would be replaced in Australia’s squad by John Hastings for the second match at the Gabba ground in Brisbane on Friday.The move was designed to the give the all-rounder a rest before an intense spell of cricket.Marsh is not carrying an injury and the decision came about purely to give him a break.“I cannot work it out, he must be knocked up from practising,” Border was quoted as saying by Cricket Australia.“Because he hasn’t played a lot to be rested, really. If I was him I’d be insisting ‘if I’m in the side I’m going to play’”Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, who recently retired, said he was always reluctant to take a break due to the risk of potentially placing unwanted pressure on his spot in the side when he returned.“I wanted to play as many games for Australia as I possibly could and I never liked to give another guy an opportunity,” Haddin said on Thursday.“Because if they come in and get a hundred, you might come back into the team but it puts that pressure on you that you don’t need. “(Marsh) hasn’t played a lot of cricket and he hasn’t had great opportunities to bat.”“And during the one-day series it’s sometimes a great opportunity to get yourself back into the rhythm of batting leading into such a big series in New Zealand,” he added.
