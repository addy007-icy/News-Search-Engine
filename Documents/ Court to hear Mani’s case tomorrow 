An anti-corruption court here is scheduled to hear on Saturday the contentious Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) report clearing former Finance Minister K.M. Mani of all charges in the bar licence renewal bribery case.John. K. Illikadan, Vigilance Commissioner and Special Judge, is likely to send notice to the complainants in the case, notably Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan and Kerala Bar Hotel Association (KBHA) working president Biju Ramesh.In October, he had rejected a similar finding by the agency and ordered a further inquiry. His decision had triggered the voluntary exit of the then VACB director Vinson. M. Paul. Subsequently, the High Court upheld the decision, forcing Mr. Mani to quit office.Legal battleThe hearing signals the start of another vexatious legal battle which would have significant ramifications for Mr. Mani and the ruling front.The VACB’s decision not to indict Mr. Mani for graft hinged on the results of four fresh lines of inquiry opened by the agency’s new Director N. Sankar Reddy.Cellphone recordsIt banked on cell phone records of KBHA members to disprove the statement of a crucial witness that they had met at a public place on April 1, 2014 to pool the Rs.35 lakh that was allegedly paid to Mr. Mani at his official residence the next day. The agency surmised that the lie-detector test given to the witness Ambili, a driver of Mr. Ramesh, was untrustworthy. It found that the questionnaire for the polygraph examination was prepared on the basis of inherently false premises.The voice recordings submitted as evidence were tampered with.The agency found no ulterior motive in Mr. Mani’s decision to defer the Cabinet decision on the renewal of non-standard bar licences.
