At a time when the nation debates the death of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula of the University of Hyderabad, a reported case of caste discrimination against Dalit residents of St. Teresa’s College hostel here has been dragging on for over 15 years.As the legal battle got protracted, two prosecution witnesses, former residents of St. Teresa’s hostel where the Dalit students were reportedly discriminated against, turned hostile. However, six former students stuck to the prosecution version and gave supporting evidence.The First Information Report of the case stated that the college Principal, hostel warden and head accounts officer discriminated against the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe residents of the hostel by putting them together in a dormitory. During the time of the alleged incidents, there were 41 residents belonging to the SC/ST categories in the college hostel. The trial of the case began at the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 2 only in 2009 though the police had booked the case in 2000. There are 29 witnesses. One of the accused died a few years ago. One could not say when the case would be over as the examination of a few witnesses was progressing, said an official. However, K. Chandrasekhara Babu, former Director of Collegiate Education, who is a witness in the case, is undaunted by delay and travels from Chennai to Kochi to depose as a witness. Mr. Babu was in Kochi on Friday, the third time in a row to give evidence.Though it was recommended that the provisions relating to prevention of atrocities against the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes should be invoked in the case, the police chose to register a case under the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act, 1955, said Mr. Babu who had reported the discrimination to the government after a surprise inspection in the college.
