The Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) tax collection is going on at a snailâ€™s pace even as the fiscal year is coming to an end.This was revealed by the councillors at the HDMC general body meeting held here on Wednesday. Raising this matter, member of the ruling BJP Veeranna Savadi said that the HDMC had taken a severe beating in tax collection.So far it could not collect more than 20 per cent of the set target in major areas.While Rs. 7.69 crore was collected in the town planning section against the set target of collecting Rs. 30 crore, the collection of taxes in the health sections stands at Rs. 72 lakh tax against the target of Rs. 1.50 crore.Similarly, in building section a target to collect Rs. 30 crore was set but only Rs. 7 crore was collected so far.The HDMC had also expected Rs. 2 crore revenue from advertisement and publicity, but the tax collection is as low as Rs. 15 lakh, he said.However, health officials said that tax collection was hampered due to staff shortage.Moreover, more revenue is expected in February, the deadline to renew trade license, they added.Congress member Ganesh Tagargunti said that the HDMC could generate Rs. 500 crore if the building permission and completion certificate fee was collected properly, he said.Mayor Ashwini Majjagi who chaired the meeting, directed the officials to ensure meeting the target before the end of the fiscal.The meeting decided to send a proposal to the State government seeking permission to launch the One Time Settlement (OTS) for water tax. Congress members from Hubballi made a demand in this regard.However, HDMC Commissioner C.M. Noor Mansur said that the State Government had seized the powers of the civic bodies to launch OTS. Hence, the HDMC could only appeal the government to give them one more chance, he said.
