Loan being given to the State government by Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) of the NABARD is the cheapest, NABARD General Manager L Munda said.Addressing officials from implementing departments of the State government from the four North Andhra districts here on Monday, he urged the officials to realise that RIDF project was a source of savings for the State.The proposals sent by implementing agencies at the district level would be cleared by the high-powered committee at the State-level headed by the Chief Secretary, he added.One of the most important issues that cropped up during the reviews was data inconsistency, the status reports at the State-level were found to be different from the reports from the ground level, the NABARD GM said.The RIDF loans have helped states create infrastructure in rural areas, NABARD AGM A.K. Mishra said adding that the RIDF loans are given in three broad categories, agriculture and allied sectors, social sector and rural connectivity.He advised the officials to flag the issues and problems like land acquisition, forest area and environmental clearance, among others in the DPR to enable the bank to take an informed decision while evaluating the proposal.The officials should exercise caution while preparing the DPRs and include details like the exact location of the project to help field inspection, he added. RIDF is demand based and not a general allocation, he said.The bank officials from the regional office Kalyansundaram and Sanjay Joglekar explained issues involved in preparation of DPRs and the grounds for rejection of the proposals. They said what expenses could be included and which were not eligible. During an interaction they clarified the doubts of the officials.AGM Visakhapatnam district K.V.S.S.L.V. Prasada Rao, superintendent engineers, DEs and other officials from different departments from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts, attended the review meeting.
