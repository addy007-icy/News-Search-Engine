A group of highly motivated individuals who actively carried out voluntary work during the floods met on Saturday to discuss their next course of action, at the South Asian headquarters of Aide et Action International (AEAI), an Geneva-based NGO, in Chetpet.The NGO which actively co-ordinated with individuals across the city to help out during the Chennai floods hosted the volunteers for “People for People” event to deliberate on their next step towards betterment of the affected people.“A group which started out as few as five members on WhatsApp, soon grew to over a hundred volunteers who wanted to help the flood-affected people,” says Sarah P. Ramya, programme manager, AEAI, South Asia region. She adds that all the volunteers were felicitated during the “Coffee with Volunteers” event organised at Loyola college to recognise their contribution and the select volunteers who have come here are those who are deeply inspired to bring about change in their localities.The group has people from diverse professions, and age groups with a goal to seek sustainable solutions to the city’s problems. Shinu, an advocate at the Chennai HC, says he is eager to put out his perspective on the city's infrastructure at the meeting.“The agenda for this event is to keep alive the spirit of volunteerism through these change agents and direct it towards sustained positive change that will affect the people” says Ravi Pratap Singh, Regional Director, South Asia, AEAI.
