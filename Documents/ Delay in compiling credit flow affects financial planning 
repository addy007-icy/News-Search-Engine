Even though almost a month has gone now since the third quarter of the current financial ended on December 31, the lead bank is yet to come out with the data on the proportional achievement of annual credit plan targets for the period in the district.The delays are becoming common in every quarter with the data for the second quarter eventually got compiled almost two months after the conclusion of the said period.Reason cited by the lead bank sources is the tardy submission of data by majority of the banks despite sending reminders to them. More than 50 per cent of the 42 commercial banks having a total of 307 branches in the district submit the data mostly after a month, sources added.Disbursements“Due to this, financial planning for the subsequent quarter of the fiscal becomes difficult. Unless the achievements on credit disbursements vis-a-vis the proportional targets for the respective quarter was compiled quickly, steps could not be taken to speed up the credit disbursements in priority sectors like agriculture, MSME, housing and education, among others, so as to ensure achievement of targets set for the financial year,” said banking experts.The banking sources pointed out though the lead bank scheme, introduced in 1969, envisages the need to coordinate the efforts of all credit institutions in the allotted districts to increase the flow of credit to priority sectors, there is no yard stick given on the stipulated period for submission.“It is a drawback that the lead bank has only coordinating powers not any capacity to enforce various banks to submit the data for the period ended quickly,” the banking sources added.
