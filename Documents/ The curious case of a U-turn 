Several Gurgaon residents are caught in a peculiar situation. They are forced to adhere to Delhi’s odd-even formula without actually travellng to Delhi.Since the closure of the U-turn near the now defunct Sirhaul Plaza, the traffic from IFFCO Chowk side going towards DLF Phase III or Ambience Mall, is forced to enter Delhi and take a U-turn from under the Rajokri flyover, nearly 750 m away from Delhi-Gurgaon border.With the odd-even formula in force in Delhi since January 1, the Delhi Police put barricades at the Delhi-Gurgaon border on Monday and challaned vehicles coming from Gurgaon and going towards Delhi, including vehicles that were just taking U-turn at the Rajokri flyover. While some motorists were challaned, others were let off.“I was on my way home when a policeman stopped me at Delhi-Gurgaon border for travelling in an odd number vehicle. After I explained that I was just taking U-turn at Rajokri flyover and showed him the society sticker, he let me off. However, a friend visiting me from M.G. Road ended up paying the fine a few hours later,” said Surina.Many seeking exemption on the ground that they too wanted to take a U-turn from under the Rajokri flyover were informed that all those entering Delhi had to comply with the scheme.“We are forced to adhere to the formula or face action without actually travelling to Delhi. At least, vehicle carrying stickers of residential colonies in Gurgaon should be exempted or they can put the barricade beyond the U-turn,” Lagoon Apartments Residents’ Welfare Association president Praveen Kakkar.Special CP (Traffic) Muktesh Chander said since those leaving Ambience Mall are forced to enter Delhi to return to Gurgaon, the police let them off without a fine.( With inputs from Shiv Sunny )
