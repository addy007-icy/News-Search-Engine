With the Opposition hurling charges of ‘return of jungle raj’ against the ruling coalition in Bihar for the deteriorating law and order situation, Deputy Chief Minister and RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav here on Sunday asked detractors whether they would say the country was undergoing “a reign of terror” if terrorist attacks happened.Addressing a press conference, Mr. Tejaswi Yadav appealed to the Opposition BJP not to indulge in negative politics and defame Bihar.Following the recent incidents of crime and extortions, Opposition leaders have been slamming the Nitish Kumar-led government, alleging that “jungle raj-2” has returned to the State.The rule of the RJD, which was in power from 1990 till 2005, was widely criticised as “jungle raj” for its perceived collapse of law and order.“When certain crimes happen in the State and you call it jungle raj, then will you use the word aatank raj (reign of terror) to describe the country after a terror attack, in Pathankot or elsewhere?” asked Mr. Tejaswi Yadav, who is also the younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav.‘Criminals won’t be spared’“Stop the negative politics against Bihar as our government under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is committed to the rule of law and no criminal will be spared,” the Deputy CM said.
