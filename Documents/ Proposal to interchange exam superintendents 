The Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board is contemplating to interchange chief superintendents of SSLC examinations centres to ensure that there are no malpractices. There have been instances where head masters of a particular school, who are posted as chief superintendents in the same school, avoid checking malpractices. Hence, there is a proposal before the board to interchange chief superintendents, sources said.In effect, the headmaster of one particular school will be posted as the chief superintendent of examinations at a different school. Discussions are on at the higher-level, involving officials of the Education Department, in this regard. The proposal was also brought to the notice of the Minister for Education. The Education Department is examining whether allowances need to be given to the head masters if they are assigned a different school or posted outside their head quarters.Commissioner of Education Department K.S. Sathyamurthy came up with the idea to interchange chief superintendents, said highly placed official sources. The Minister had reportedly directed the Commissioner to ensure that there are squads, comprising teachers from different schools, to check malpractices.Officials had argued that mobile/ flying squads would not be present in a school from the beginning of the examination till the end and hence there was scope for malpractices.
