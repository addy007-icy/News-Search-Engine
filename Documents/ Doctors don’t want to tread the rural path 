A general surgeon, who was recruited by the Health Department through the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) to the Madhugiri general hospital early this month, resigned after a day’s work. Another gynaecologist, who joined the community health centre (CHC) in M.N. Kote near Gubbi, remained absent from the second day.These are just two of the several cases of doctors, recruited recently, choosing to stay away from work from the second or third day itself.Despite enhanced salaries and incentives, there are not many takers for medical posts in the department. The department’s recent recruitment drive conducted through KPSC has only validated this. Of 1,122 applicants, only 597 have reported for duty.This is striking, especially when the number of applicants is many times the existing posts in other government departments.While attractive salaries offered by private hospitals and an opportunity to work in urban areas are one set of reasons keeping away doctors from joining government hospitals, senior government doctors say there were many more factors at play.“Absence of a conducive atmosphere that includes assault by patients’ relatives and harassment by followers of local politicians have also created a sense of fear and phobia among doctors, who are ready to work for even lower salaries in a small hospital in urban areas rather than a taluk hospital or primary health centre,” said a noted government doctor.With many rural hospitals being under the control of zilla panchayats, doctors are worried that they have to depend on panchayats for almost everything, including release of salaries.“Inadequate infrastructure in rural hospitals and specialists having to also function as casualty medical officers are the main reasons for the dismally poor response to the department’s recruitment drive,” said another senior government doctor.Also, a specialist does not have scope for brushing up his/her speciality as most of the times a complicated case is referred to a higher facility due to lack of infrastructure in the local hospital, the doctor explained.Health Commissioner P.S. Vastrad said it is “impossible to wish away elected representatives in a democracy.” He added that in many rural areas, even a fresh medical graduate is greatly revered, rather than harassed, because he/she is seen as a life saver.
