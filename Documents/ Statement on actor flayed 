K.C. Venugopal, MP, on Monday termed totally irresponsible senior civil servant Amitabh Kant’s statement on actor Aamir Khan and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take action against the officer for violating service rules.Days after Mr. Kant, the newly appointed NITI Aayog chief executive officer, made a statement defending Mr. Khan’s exit from the Incredible India campaign, Mr. Venugopal said the officer “stooped to such a level to appease his political masters who have granted him a new post in the NITI Aayog.”Mr. Kant, a Kerala cadre officer, is currently posted as Secretary of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. — PTI
