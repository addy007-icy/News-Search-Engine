The challenge for the police is on February 7, when the main events will be held at RK Beach. And it will be open to the public. It is estimated that about 1.5 lakh visitors are likely to attend.While the traffic plans are yet to be finalised, giving a few details, Mr. Amit Garg said that the traffic will be stopped at Maddilapalem and visitors from the Maddilapalem side will have to use the special shuttle service or walk up to the beach. The other two entry sides are from the Collectorate and Naval Coast Battery. Vehicles will not be allowed beyond Collectorate and NCB.The stretch from Park Hotel to NCB has been taken over by the Navy to accommodate 15,000 invitees. The ICP and the operations demo will be held within this stretch. General public will have to obtain photo ID passes from the Mee Seva, which will be given shortly on the basis of Aadhaar cards. They will be factored into the beaches at NCB and Park Hotel, through two specially built ramps. No one will be allowed on to the pavements, said Mr. Amit Garg.
