Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has accused the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) of scripting a conspiracy to defeat Congress in the ensuing elections to the GHMC with the help of wealth amassed illegally.Speaking at a party meet organised to admit several TRS activists of Malkajgiri area into the Congress here on Sunday, Mr. Reddy claimed that it was the Congress that had transformed Hyderabad into a global city with various development initiatives.However, it was the ruling TRS that was trying to gain mileage by taking up publicity blitz on a large scale, including hoardings all over the city, to claim the development achieved as its hard work. The TRS failed to take up any welfare schemes, he said.
