From February 1, patients in Delhi government-run hospitals will get medicines and diagnostic tests done for free. The government has also decided to do away with user charges at these hospitals thanks to the money it has saved from three flyover projects in the Capital.The announcement was made during the inauguration of the elevated corridor between Mangolpuri and Madhuban Chowk in northwest Delhi on Sunday by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The stretch of elevated road is part of a plan to make the Outer Ring Road signal free.According to sources in the Public Works Department (PWD), which is undertaking the project, the next section of this corridor to Mukerba Chowk is also going to be inaugurated very soon. “It is going to be another Rs.100 crore gift to Delhiites,” said a senior PWD official who didn’t wish to be named.Congratulating the PWD, Mr. Kejriwal said that while the original sanctioned cost of the stretch of elevated corridor was Rs.425 crore, the actual cost incurred has been Rs.300 crore, saving the government Rs.125 crore.He said that the government is going to save a total of Rs.350 crore in the construction of three flyovers as part of the entire project and it is this money that will be used to subsidise healthcare at government hospitals.He thanked the PWD for its efficiency that has ensured that the projects are being completed at costs lower than even the sanctioned amount.Mr. Kejriwal also thanked former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who had commissioned the project during the previous Congress led Delhi government.The money ‘saved’ from the cost of flyovers would be used to provide free medicines to patients at the Delhi government run hospitals and provide free facilities like X-ray, ultrasound tests, blood tests, etc.
