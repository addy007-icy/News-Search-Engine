The deadline for withdrawal of nominations to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections will close at 3 p.m. on Thursday, but the Congress, Telugu Desam and the BJP were yet to issue B-forms confirming candidature to most of their nominees.In the light of its bitter experience in the elections to Legislative Council from local bodies constituency when a Congress candidate pulled out of the contest in Nizamabad, the party has withheld issue of B-forms to all its 134 candidates announced so far. The party on Wednesday night handed over the forms to its in-charges in Assembly segments who will release the same to the candidates with the deadline approaching.In Secunderabad and Kukatpally Assembly constituencies where there are no in-charges for the Congress, the forms were given to former MPs M. Anjan Kumar Yadav and Sarve Satyanarayana respectively.The Congress had finalised the candidates for 134 wards and hoped to field TRS, TDP and BJP rebels who have filed nominations in the remaining 16 wards. The party leadership warned candidates other than those whose names were officially announced to withdraw nominations by afternoon on Thursday, failing which disciplinary action would be initiated against them.The TDP and BJP issued the B-forms to their candidates where there was no dispute but withheld elsewhere. The two parties which are contesting in alliance in the ratio of 83:67 wards respectively could not come to an understanding at a few places. The BJP was also embroiled in inner party controversy, as its MLA Raja Singh was not happy with the candidature at Gunfoundry.
