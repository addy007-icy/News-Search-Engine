The police have formed five special teams to investigate the case in which the body of a woman was found with the head severed near a garbage bin on the Mount-Poonamallee Road in Ramapuram in the early hours of Tuesday.The police are combing through ‘woman missing cases’ from different parts of the city to see if any of those cases matches the one they are investigating.“No one has come forward till now. There are many women who are living alone in the city, so it may take sometime for the family or a friend to know that she is missing,” said a police officer.Police said that once the identity of the victim was ascertained, then it would become much easier to crack the murder. “The woman has undergone a caesarean operation,” said a police officer.On Tuesday, a sanitary worker noticed the body, wrapped in a bedsheet, lying beside the garbage bin. Police searched for the head of the woman in garbage bins nearby. “They also searched for it in a nearby canal and the bushes but could not find it,” police said.They suspect that the murder would have been committed elsewhere or could have been done near the canal. The CCTV footage from nearby buildings is also being obtained. Doctors, doing the post-mortem, said the body was that of a 25-year-old's. “We are waiting for someone to claim the body,” a police source said.
