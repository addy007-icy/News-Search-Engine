On Sunday, Tree Walk, a group of nature lovers in the city, continued its mission of increasing awareness of various trees.Getting together at Thycaud, they kick-started a new series in their initiative — Tree Alphabets, based on the nomenclature or common English names of trees seen around.This was aimed at remembering the trees based on their names which relate to interesting aspects.Tree Walk began its walk in the first of the series from the gate of the Swathi Tirunal music college towards the Government Guest House.A — apple trees do not grow in the tropical climate of the State, but there are trees which bear the name apple in the city.They are named thus owing to the fruits they bear. The first is the golden apple or stone apple or wood apple (koovalam). The Kerala School Teachers Association office compound in the area has one koovalam.A star apple tree, known as swarnapatrika because of the golden or silver coloration on the underside of its leaves, stands in the Government Model Lower Primary School compound. Further on, the walkers found a small tree by the roadside near the Guest House — sugar apple or custard apple, popularly known as seetapazham.B — on the music college campus stands a bullet wood tree. It is commonly called Elanji. The Gandhi Bhavan and Kerala State Council for Child Welfare campuses shelter the bedda nut or myrobalan (Thanni).C – The coral wood or manjadi tree on the Gandhi Bhavan campus is difficult to miss. Also seen in the area are copperpod (chara konna) and the copal (Indian) tree (kunthirikkam) trees.Tree Walk hopes to attract more people, especially children, for the walks so that they can relate to the diversity of nature and help protect it.
