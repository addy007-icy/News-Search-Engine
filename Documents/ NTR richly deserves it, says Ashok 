Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP founder N.T. Rama Rao’s 20th death anniversary became an occasion for his party to renew demands that he be conferred with the country’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna.“He [NTR] wanted human beings to rise and his concentration was more towards Telugus. So, he came and helped them, gave them political power. If he doesn’t deserve the Bharat Ratna then I don’t think anyone deserves it,” said Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju.
