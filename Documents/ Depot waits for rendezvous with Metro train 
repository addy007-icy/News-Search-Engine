hat was a 58-acre paddy field at Muttom near Aluva about three years ago will shortly reverberate with 75 Kochi Metro trains.The field metamorphosed into the depot after it was raised by an average of 3.75 metres, using 6.50 lakh cubic metres of mud. Tipper lorries operated approximately 65,000 trips, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials said.The Metroâ€™s sprawling coach depot will also house among other amenities, its operational-control centre, test track, ramp to take trains from depot to the viaduct, workshop, pit and stabling lines, two power stations which are in different stages of completion.With the first lot of three trains set to arrive at the depot on January 12 from Andhra Pradesh, work is on at a war footing to ready the inspection depot and other amenities for coupling together the mechanical, electrical and communication systems of the three coaches.The first metro train will then be preened up for test runs. The train will be formally unveiled on January 23 by Chief Minister Ommen Chandy, following which it will commence test runs. As on Sunday, the 975-metre-long test track is almost ready, while workers were engaged in installing third-traction rail on the side for trains to source power, unmindful of the blazing sun. The unloading area for coaches is ready, while high-mast lights are being installed across the one-km-long premises. The KSEB has provided a temporary power connection.Beehive of activityThis much work was accomplished at the depot which is now a beehive of activity despite a slew of agitations by local residents who opposed hundreds of tipper lorries vrooming along their roads (till DMRC built an underpass), problems caused by regional trade unions, heavy monsoons during two seasons, litigations and delay in land acquisition.The sprawling premises located parallel to NH-47 and the Aluva-Ernakulam railway line also have dedicated ducts for different cables and utilities, covered by thick concrete slabs. What is striking is the fit and finish of civil and other works, which shows attention given to detail.Macho machines and slim but strongly-built men are engaged in readying amenities at the depot which will be handed over to Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) later this year.Safety too has been accorded prime of place, as could be seen from numerous boards that warn workers of precautions they ought to take. Some even exhort them to drink plenty of water to endure the humid weather. Fire hydrant pipes run all through the depot.The field metamorphosed into the depot after it was raised by an average of 3.75 metres.
