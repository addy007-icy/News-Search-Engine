National vice-president of the BJP and the former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s statement that financial progress under the Special Component Plan (SCP)and Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) till December was less than 40 per cent was the reflection of the management of State finances.Talking to presspersons here on Thursday, Mr. Yeddyurappa said that Mr. Siddaramaiah, should take the blame for the present state of affairs.“It is the duty of the Chief Minister to periodically review the progress of development works in each and every department. Mr. Siddaramaiah has lost interest in governance and is more interested in other matters,” he said.He said even Ministers in the Siddaramaiah Cabinet seldom conducted review of their departments regularly to ensure that the funds for the development works are spent on time.He said that as per information not even a single department had spent more than 50 per cent of the earmarked funds and with the election code of conduct to come into force for the elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats, taking up new projects would be difficult. Mr. Yeddyurappa said that with the current phase of financial progress it would be a daunting task for the State to achieve a 70 per cent plan expenditure.Similarly the resource mobilisation has also taken a beating this year with major departments finding it difficult to achieve the targets.He said that the core committee of party is likely to meet on January 20 and 21 in Bengaluru to finalise candidates for the byelections to the Assembly from Bidar, Hebbal and Deodurg constituencies.‘It is daunting for the State government to now achieve 70 per cent plan expenditure’
