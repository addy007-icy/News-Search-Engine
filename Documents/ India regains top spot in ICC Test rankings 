India has reclaimed the top spot in the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Test rankings after a gap of almost four-and-a-half years, thanks to their recent series win over South Africa at home.India had previously held the No. 1 Test position from December 2009 to August 2011.The rankings were released following the conclusion of the Centurion Test in which South Africa defeated England by 280 runs.With only 11 points separating top ranked India from sixth-ranked New Zealand, there is potential for further changes before the April 1 annual cut-off date.Australia is ranked second with 109.4 points and the third-placed South Africa has 108.9.In the ICC Test player rankings, South Africans Kagiso Rabada, Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla and England’s Ben Stokes have made impressive gains.Rabada recorded figures of 7/112 and 6/32 in the two innings of the Centurion Test to vault 32 places to 30th in the rankings for Test bowlers.Rabada started the series in the 122nd position and has gained 92 places after earning 447 points following his 22 wickets in the series. As Rabada is still in the qualification period for bowlers, he is expected to move further up the ladder, depending on how he performs later this year.The bowling table is headed by England’s Stuart Broad, while Ravichandran Ashwin is the top-ranked all-rounder.RankTeamMatchesPointsRating1India3235351102Australia4043761093South Africa3437031094Pakistan2829771065England4546101026New Zealand363578997Sri Lanka353123898West Indies332504769Bangladesh2210264710Zimbabwe10535
