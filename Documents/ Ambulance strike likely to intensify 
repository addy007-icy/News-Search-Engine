The protest by employees of 108 Arogya Kavacha is likely to intensify with the company set to terminate the services of 160 employees on Friday. The government is also likely to invoke Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) on the protesters, if they fail to withdraw the strike.Syed Suhale Parveez, senior manager of GVK EMRI, which helps run the service, told The Hindu that it had identified 160 employees, who had instigated others to strike work, partially disrupting the service. “The termination orders will be issued on Friday,” he said.He said with 1,000 more employees joining the protest on Thursday, the services were further hit. “However, we have got 382 government ambulance drivers and 200 KSRTC drivers, apart from 439 government paramedical staff deputed to ensure that people are not put to hardship,” he said.Mr. Parveez said that unless the employees signed an undertaking promising that they would follow company rules, they would not be allowed to resume work. “We have revised the undertaking allowing the employees to approach the government only in the presence of a company representative,” he said. With the threat of ESMA hanging on their heads, the protesters met Health Minister U.T. Khader and apprised him of the three “unacceptable” clauses in the undertaking . “He asked us to meet the company officials,” said Srishaila Halloor, president of the Karnataka State 108 Arogya Kavacha Employees’ Association.
