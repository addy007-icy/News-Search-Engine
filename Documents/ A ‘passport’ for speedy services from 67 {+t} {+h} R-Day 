Here is good news for Passport applicants on the 67{+t}{+h}Republic Day. The Ministry of External Affairs has simplified the procedure of Police Verification for applications submitted for the first time under ‘normal’ category.“This is a major initiative taken by the Ministry to help applicants, provided they submit Aadhaar, Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC), PAN card and an affidavit in Annexure-I. The passports for these applicants would be issued in two days on post Police Verification basis. Applicants submitting wrong information would, however, be liable for penal action,” Passport Officer N.L.P. Choudary said.The good thing to cheer about for applicants is that they need not pay additional fee as in the case of ‘Tatkal’. This is not all, the Ministry has also introduced a new system, wherein the applicant could choose any appointment date from the earliest five available dates (working days) while scheduling/rescheduling an appointment for passport services.The Ministry has also launched ‘mPassport Police App’ for speedy submission of Police Verification Report (PVR). This app would facilitate field-level verification officers to directly capture the PVR into the system digitally. The app eliminates the need to download and print the Personal Particulars Form and questionnaire, resulting in paperless end-to-end digital flow of the verification process.
