Kusuma had lodged a cheating complaint in December last year against a person whom she had got acquainted with on Shaadi.com. She alleged that the man had contacted her on the pretext of getting married, but had started asking for money. “Once she transferred some money online, he stopped all communication with her, which prompted Kusuma to lodge a complaint with the Kadugodi police,” a senior police officer said.Nidhi told the police that Kusuma, a divorcee, was planning to re-marry. She had recently uploaded her resume on matrimonial websites and had also met a few people.
