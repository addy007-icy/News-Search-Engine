The election committee of TRS held marathon meeting at the residence of Member of Parliament B.B. Patil in the finalisation of candidates for the remaining 70 wards of GHMC which were left out of the first two lists that were announced on Friday.However, the names were not released till late night though it was stated that it would be done anytime.On the other hand, the Congress leaders led by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Ramachandra Kuntia also held prolonged discussions at a hotel and finalised 49 names. They will be in addition to the list of 45 candidates announced on Friday.It looked like a tussle between TRS, Congress and MIM in the announcement of candidates as each party waited for its rival to come up with names to avoid poaching.The problem was confounded for the Congress, as it feared the selected candidates might not file nominations due to pressure from TRS.Even after getting the tickets, the candidates might still shift loyalty to TRS just as it happened in the elections to Legislative Council from local bodiesâ€™ constituency in Nizamabad.The Congress was also faced with the threat of more than one aspirant for tickets filing nominations on Sunday when the deadline expired.The party feared that those denied tickets might remain in the fray as rebels.On the flip side, the Congress also entertained a TRS rebel Janagama Suresh Reddy who was denied ticket from Kukatpally Housing Board Colony.The TRS cadre laid siege to the residence of the MLC S. Ramulu Naik at Erragadda protesting against five new faces being given ticket in wards of Jubilee Hills Assembly constituency.It looks like a tussle between TRS, Congress and MIM in the announcement of candidates as each party waits for its rival to come up with names to avoid poaching
