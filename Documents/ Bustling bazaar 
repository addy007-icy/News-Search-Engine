Morning when I hear the cymbals,Not only the cymbals do I hearBut, the vendorsâ€™ sounds reach my earsBuy bread, buy spices, buy fruitsThe scorching heat of noonIn pigeon holes, the pigeons napAll the vendors have lunchThe bazaar gets rushed in the eveningBuy flowers, buy vegetables, buy eggsWhen the sky twinkles, the bazaar shinesUnder the canopy of stars,Nearby, people watch from balconiesThe stars shining in the skyAnd vendors end their day with a smile.Yash Karan, VIII A, St. Andrews High School, Hyderabad
