On the first day of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam’s 64{+t}{+h}anniversary celebrations, Ramakrishnan Murthy began his concert with Dikshithar’s navagrahakriti, “Chandram bhaja” in Asaveri, and then sang Tyagaraja’s “Vidulaku” through which the saint bows to the long line of divine musical entities who sought enlightenment through the harmony of notes and beats. The singer worked hard at bringing out the essence of Mayamalavagowlai all through the song.A few phrases in Anandabharavi were sung before Shyama Shastri’s “Marivere” which set the tone of gentle entreaty that the singer complemented with a neraval on “Sada nammithi Meenakshi”, who favours her devotees with good fortune.In all his efforts he was ably supported by the members of his team, R.K.Shriramkumar on the violin, K.V.Prasad on the mridangam, and Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira.The singer then took on the pleasurable task of delineating Todi, along with the violinist for Sivan’s “Karthikeya Kangeya”, first with an alapana, and later through free flowing Kalpana swaras in three speeds. This was followed by a scintillating tani by percussionists.The rigorous raga elaboration and well-timed tana presentation for the pallavi, “Mamava” rounded off with swaras in Ragamalika, were well received by rasikas. The lines of the pallavi were credited to the violinist, R.K.Sriramkumar. He concluded the concert with an ashtapathi in Nadanamakritya.Rajalakshmi Padmanabhan
