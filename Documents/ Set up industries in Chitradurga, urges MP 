If small and medium industries are encouraged it will help unemployed people, B.N. Chandrappa, MP, has said.Speaking after inaugurating a district-level investors’ meet, organised by the Department of Industries and Commerce and the Challakere Chamber of Commerce here on Saturday, he said that to ensure a better future for India, job opportunities should be created at rural areas so that the poor can earn their livelihood.Since every taluk in the district has different resources and opportunities to establish industries, leading industries at the State-level should open their units in places like Challakere and Molkalmuru taluks. “To attract industries across Karnataka, the State government has organised investors’ meet at Bengaluru from February 3 to 5,” he said.He also said that the State government would provide land, electricity, water and other facilities at subsidised rates to ensure more job opportunities, he said.Raghumurthy, Challakere MLA, informed that the State government had developed 4,498 acres of industrial area to attract industries.“Since Molkalmuru and Challakere taluks face severe drought from decades and are considered as backward areas, industries should concentrate on opening their units in these areas,” he added.Halswamy, Additional Director of Department of Industries and Commerce, said that there were ample opportunities to establish industries in Chitradurga. Since investors from many countries like Japan, Italy and France are planning to invest in India, the State government has organised investors meet in February. During the meet, the companies would be informed about the facilities and resources available in Chitradurga, he said.Jayamma Balraj, MLC, Chitradurga Chamber of Commerce Chairman N.
