A High Court should not interfere with the award of the Industrial Tribunal on “mere technicalities”, the Delhi High Court has ruled.The court also said that interference is permissible only if the order of the Industrial Adjudicator suffers from an error of jurisdiction or breach of principles of natural justice or is vitiated by an error of law.Disposing of a writ petition filed by the Delhi Transport Corporation, challenging an award in favour of a conductor whose services were terminated, the court said the re-appraisal of evidence without sufficient reason in law to arrive at a finding contrary to that arrived at by the Industrial Adjudicator was not the intent of exercising judicial review.The findings of fact recorded by an authority duly constituted for the purpose could not be interfered with so long as they were based upon some material relevant for the purpose, said the Bench of Justice Sunita Gupta in a judgment delivered last week.The DTC had challenged the Labour Court’s award of April 30, 2013, granting the relief of back wages to the conductor, Jagdish Prashad, from 2006 to his superannuation along with continuity of service and consequential benefits.The court said the findings of the Labour Court could not be said to be perverse, in view of the evidence available on record, calling for interference.The DTC had accused Mr. Prashad of issuing tickets of less denomination to two passengers after getting full fare from them.However, the Bench modified the Labour Court's award by granting a lump sum compensation of Rs.5 lakh in view of three warnings issued to the conductor in the past, withholding of his three increments and another termination, followed by reinstatement.The High court said that interference is permissible only if the order of the Industrial Adjudicator suffers from an error
