The Union government has allocated Rs.50 crore for urban development projects under Amrut (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) to Alappuzha. The district administration will monitor the progress of works under the project.An amount of Rs.33.39 crore will be spent on making water supply more efficient in municipal wards. Old pipes forming part of the water supply system will be replaced as part of the development project.Waste management schemes will be given Rs.2.09 crore while Rs.6.28 crore will be spent on projects to eliminate water stagnation. Schemes to improve urban transport will be given Rs.6.85 crore. An amount of Rs.89 lakh will be spent on improving amenities at picnic spots.Amrut is expected to be a boon to Alappuzha which has been facing scarcity of potable water despite the presence of a number of waterbodies. The presence of lagoons, estuaries and backwater and coastal erosion has resulted in the water turning non-potable at many places. The tidal effect felt along the coast has also affected the quality of groundwater along coastal belt.A drinking water project for Alappuzha taken up more than a decade ago with HUDCO aid was abandoned due to non-realisation of the aid. Another project under Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) was taken up later to cater to needs of coastal areas such as Purakkad, Punnapra, Mararikkulam, Mannancherry and Aryad, apart from the city. Laying of pipes is in progress at various stretches, but commissioning of the project remains a far cry.Stateâ€™s shareApart from Alappuzha, eight cities in Kerala have been selected for infrastructure development under the Amrut scheme. The Union government will extend 50 per cent of funds for the projects under the scheme. The State government will have to bear 30 per cent of the spending while the local body concerned will have to spend 20 per cent.Amrut focusses on the upgrade of basic infrastructure. Apart from ensuring water supply and sewerage connection, the scheme envisages development of green cover, parks and improved transport amenities targeted at reduction in pollution.Rs.33.39 crore granted for better water supply systemFunds for waste management, urban transport
