The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIMB), threw open its gates to differently-abled members of the public on Sunday. It was a morning of fun and competitive sports, an afternoon reserved for an inspirational talk and an evening that saw an interactive panel discussion celebrating ‘special’ abilities.In the morning, several activities such as wheelchair basketball, table tennis, carom and chess were organised.“The day was put together by our Executive MBA students. Every year, they do something beneficial to the differently-abled. This time, ‘Prayas Day’ was organised. IIMB’s is a disabled-friendly campus with ramps and other facilities,” said an IIMB spokesman.The focus of the talk in the afternoon session was on how differently-abled people have managed to find success despite all odds. “Every person will face some disability at least once in their life,” said para-athlete Malathi Krishnamurthy Holla, a Padma Shri and Arjuna awardee.According to the 57-year old, who has undergone 33 painful surgeries, those who have everything but are still dissatisfied are the ones who are truly disabled.The day ended with a panel discussion on ‘Breaking Down Societal Barriers’, moderated by Justin Jesudas, an international para-swimmer.
