Not too happy with the use of overhead ‘Spidercam’ during the ODI series against Australia, India’s limited-over skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has called for a balance in the usage of such technology so that it doesn’t interfere with the on-field action.During the fifth ODI, India were denied a boundary in the 19th over when Virat Kohli’s shot off John Hastings had hit the spidercam, prompting the umpires to declare it a dead ball.Though it didn’t have any bearing on the result as India chased down a 331-run victory target to clinch the final ODI by six wickets but Dhoni said such intrusion can affect the results of close contests.“I am quite a traditional guy. Anything that disturbs the game of cricket I don’t like it,” Dhoni told reporters after India won the fifth one-dayer to avoid a whitewash.“It all started right from the Twenty20 where people would be like, ‘Why don’t you wear a mic?’, ‘Why don’t you wear a camera?’“I always feel there is always a need for a balance. At the end of the day, it’s a spectators’ sport, people watching on television, but at the same time four runs can really matter.“Especially when it’s a 310-320 game, those four runs can be crucial,” he said.Dhoni also suggested that some form of penalty should be imposed if Spidercam gets in the way during the match.“Everyone gets penalised, why not have the same system for the Spidercam? Say, ‘Okay if you get hit, $2,000 per hit.’ Let’s make it interesting,” he said jokingly.Australian captain also Steven Smith echoed Dhoni’s views.“I just think we need to make sure it’s away when the ball is coming,” said Smith, who had dropped a simple catch at the Sydney Cricket Ground last year during a Test against India after getting distracted by the Spidercam.“We don’t need to see things like that where it’s a dead ball. Something like that can really change the course of the game.“So I just think we need to make sure we get him out of the way when the bowler is coming in to bowl,” he said.On a lighter note, Smith quipped: “He was probably our best fielder tonight, Spidercam. He saved four.”Australia didn’t have a good day on the field as there were many fielding lapses, especially by Shaun Marsh and Nathan Lyon, who dropped simple chances.
