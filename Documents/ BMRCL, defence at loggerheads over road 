Even before Namma Metro has opened the doors of its station at Minsk Square to the general public, the 50-metre link road between Cubbon Road and Bhagwan Mahaveer Road (Infantry Road) has become a bone of contention between Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) and defence authorities.The 50-metre stretch of Cunningham Road Cross that was closed for public use for nearly four years by BMRCL for the construction of the station was recently reopened.On Sunday, a board claiming that the land belonged to the defence was erected right outside the station’s entrance, nearly a month after access to the road was given to motorists, who find the link convenient.This comes days after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the defence reached an agreement to swap land required to complete 11 infrastructure projects that were in limbo.The BBMP has proposed to swap 207 acres and 24 guntas of land at Thimmanayakanahalli in Anekal for 38 acres and 28 guntas of defence land in the city.A street vendor, who has been selling his wares on this road for several years now, said, “The board suddenly came up overnight. No one seems to know who put it up.”Defence officials, when contacted, claimed that they had in their possession land records to prove that the particular road belonged to them.The defence spokesperson told The Hindu that a survey was also conducted, following which the board was erected.Meanwhile, BMRCL officials claim that the land is a public road.“If the defence had land records to show their ownership, why are they raking it up when the underground section of the East-West corridor is almost ready?” U.A. Vasanth Rao, BMRCL spokesperson, asked.Stating that BMRCL did not want to have any animosity with the defence authorities, Mr. Rao said the issue has been brewing for a month.He said that BMRCL had appraised the Revenue Department about the issue around a month ago and urged the Survey, Settlements and Land Records to conduct another survey to ascertain the ownership of the land in question.“We have gone by the government’s survey records. Around 10 days ago, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. workers were not allowed to take up road restoration works along the stretch,” Mr. Vasanth Rao further added.
