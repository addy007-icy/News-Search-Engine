The government’s apathy has not just run to ground the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), one of the most well run, structured health programmes of the State, but it has also been responsible for denying tuberculosis patients in Kerala fast and sophisticated diagnostic facilities, which is important for effective disease management.Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of resistance to Rifampicin (RIF), a main TB drug, are the key to proper TB management. CBNAAT (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) or Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a new device for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and for the rapid detection of resistance to RIF in sputum specimens. The line probe assay (LPA) now used by the State to detect drug-resistant TB cases takes about three days to produce results while GeneXpert gives the result in two hours.The Central TB Division (CTD) decided to procure GeneXpert machines for all States – Kerala will have the facility in eight districts and in all 14 districts by the end of 2016. The machines for the State are ready and waiting to be dispatched.“We gave the commitment to the CTD that we will have our sites ready for the installation of GeneXpert by January this year. With the government not releasing from State treasury even a dime of the Central funds earmarked for RNTCP for 2015-16, we will not be able to do the installation work. Switching over to GeneXpert has been a priority for the CTD and all other States have gone so much ahead in using it. We were the best-performing State in the country, but right now, the system is on the verge of collapse,” a senior Health official told The Hindu .Bulk procurement already madeCTD has already made bulk procurement of the consumables for GeneXpert and the delay in getting the machines might find the State with bulk consumables with a short expiry period, it is feared. The State already has one GeneXpert machine in its Intermediate Reference Laboratory, which was procured a year ago using Plan funds. But the machine is used sparingly, only for testing select samples, as the supply of lab consumables is limited and because of the uncertainty about funds and manpower.
