A 45-year-old Chenchu tribal man was killed as a fellow man shot him with an arrow in Amaragiri village of Mahabubnagar district.The deceased identified as Nimmala Veera Swamy (45), a fisherman, was shot by Ileni Bayyanna (26), also a Chenchu tribal man.Speaking to The Hindu , Amaragiri Sarpanch Nimmala Narasimha said Veera Swamy and Bayyanna were neighbours. Mr. Narasimha said the duo had partied together on Sankranti day when they had an argument over a petty issue. The accused ran in to his house and came armed with a bow and arrows.In his first attempt, Bayyanna hit the arrow in Veera Swamy’s stomach at around 10.30 on Thursday. Locals rushed the bleeding Veera Swamy to Kollapur hospital and later to Nagaurkurnool at night as the doctors in both the places couldn’t admit him as there was no qualified doctor to treat that particular case. Later, he was shifted to the Government Hospital, Mahabubnagar, where he was provided first-aid, but the arrow remained in his stomach.Following the suggestion of a doctor, the Sarpanch said that they shifted him to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad in the early hours of Friday. A surgery was performed on him on Saturday at 12 p.m., but he died on the same day in the night.Meanwhile, Kollapur police said that the accused Bayyanna, native of Erramattam village in Kurnool district located in Nallamala forest, had moved to Amaragiri six months ago. He fled the scene crossing the river in a boat. The police launched a manhunt to nab him.The deceased, a sole bread winner of his family, is survived by his wife Bayamma and four children. The Chenchus urged the State government to extend help to the poor family taking it as a special case.Representatives of National Adivasi Solidarity Council (NASC), Vasudeva Rao and Kanchukatla Subhash, helped the family to take the body to Amaragiri.
