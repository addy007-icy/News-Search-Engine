Travelling in the balloon were three people – the pilot, a staff of the Department of Posts and a philatelist and with them was a special cover - “Hot Air Balloon Carried Cover”.The Department organised the event jointly with Global Media Box Innovations, to coincide with the second edition of the hot air balloon festival to be held in Pollachi this month. The Kovilpalayam post office delivered the carried mail.Later in the day, Postmaster General of Western Region Manju P. Pillai released the special cover at a function at Pollachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and it was received by B.K.
