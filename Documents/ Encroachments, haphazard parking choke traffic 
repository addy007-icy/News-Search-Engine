Encroachments by shopkeepers and haphazard parking of two-wheelers and cars in market areas leave little space for vehicles to move on.The First Agraharam Street and Second Agraharam Street are the busiest stretches in the city during any time of the day. Though the roads are wider enough to ensure free flow of traffic, vehicles move only at a snail’s pace.ReasonsThe reasons cited are haphazard parking of vehicles and encroachment of space by shopkeepers.At many places, shopkeepers place iron grills in front of their shops and encroach the parking space. This forces vehicle users to park vehicles at their will. Road users want the city police to allot proper parking areas in these stretches and warn shopkeepers who encroach upon the road space to ensure free flow of traffic.
