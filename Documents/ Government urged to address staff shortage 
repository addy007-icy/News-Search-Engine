Andhra Pradesh Revenue Services Association (APRSA) State president Bopparaju Venkateswarlu on Wednesday while welcoming reforms to fine-tune the administration wanted the State government to immediately address the problem of staff shortage in the revenue department.He told reporters here that the APRSA was open to unleashing the power of information technology to improve the functioning of the department, which carried out diverse variety of functions like magisterial matters, issue of various statutory documents, conduct of elections, relief and rehabilitation, land acquisition etc.,.But the shortage of staff was hurting the implementation of government policies and welfare programmes, he said and added that revenue administrative unit at the grassroots level was unwieldy now. The government should appoint a Village Revenue Officer(VRO) for a village or a cluster of villages with a population of only 1,500 people or 1,000 acres of land as against a population of 5,000 and above now, he said.He took strong objection to booking of criminal cases against revenue employees while discharging their duties.
