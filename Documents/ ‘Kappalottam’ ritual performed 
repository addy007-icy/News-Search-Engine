‘Kappalottam’ ritual, one of the most colourful Christian ceremonies in Central Kerala, was held at St Mary’s Forane Church at Kuravilangad.The ritual begins with a nearly 40-ft wooden replica of a ship being taken out and being carried to and fro by the faithful. Usually the members of five families in the parish take the lead in the movement of the ‘ship.’The ritual has its origin in the Biblical narrative about Jewish prophet Jonah being swallowed by a whale and three days later being vomited alive.The ritual is also connected with the tale of Nazrani mariners who were safely brought to their destination in the early centuries of the common era. Kuravilangad is believed to be one of the earliest nazrani settlements in Central Travancore.The ‘ship’ was taken out around noon and then replicating the movement of a vessel in rough sea, taken to and fro around the church.Once the ritual was over, the ‘ship’ was brought back to the church where it will remain till next year. The ritual was followed by a holy mass.
