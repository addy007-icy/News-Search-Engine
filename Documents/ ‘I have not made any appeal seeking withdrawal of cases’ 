Sri Ram Sene president Pramod Mutalik has said that he had never appealed to the State government seeking withdrawal of cases registered against him in various courts in the State.Reacting sharply to the statement of Home Minister G. Parameshwara that the government was not considering withdrawing cases filed against Mr. Mutalik, he said that at no point of time he had made a request to the government seeking withdrawal of the cases.Talking to presspersons here on Thursday, Mr. Mutalik said that he had not made any request to the previous BJP government to withdraw the cases filed against him and the question of seeking withdrawal of the cases by the Congress government did not arise at all. Of the 96 cases filed against him in different courts, Mr. Mutalik said, the courts had dismissed 83 and all the charges and allegations against him had been proved false. Only 13 cases registered in five districts, between 2002 and 2014, were pending, Mr. Mutalik said.Referring to the statement of Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim opposing the proposal to withdraw the cases registered against him, Mr. Mutalik said that he (Mr. Ibrahim) was speaking in the tone of a community leader. He said that the Dakshina Kannada district administration had first given permission to Islamic scholar Zakir Naik to attend a programme in Mangaluru only to withdraw it after protests by Hindu organisations.
