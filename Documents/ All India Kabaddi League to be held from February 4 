The Telugu Kabaddi Association (TKA), Rajahmundry, affiliated to Andhra Pradesh Kabaddi Association, is going to organise All India Kabaddi League from February 4 to 7.Announcing this on Sunday, associationâ€™s honorary president and Rajahmundry Rural MLA Gorantla Butchaiah Chowdary and TKA president Y. Rajesh said that 12 States had already given their consent to participate in the Men and Women league which would be organised under floodlights for four days on the Government Arts College grounds.Mr. Gorantla said the main reason to conduct this tournament was that during the Pro-Kabaddi competitions, which were sponsored by big Corporate Companies, the AP team was represented without any Telugu player which was a shameful thing, adding that one should not forget that Kabaddi was a native game of the united Andhra and it should be encouraged at all levels.He said that Rajahmundry in recent years has conducted All India Table Tennis Championship , AP State volleyball and there is a wide scope to conduct many more sports. He admitted that construction of indoor stadium is being delayed and 12 acres of Central Jail land has to be transferred to the AP Sports Academy from the Prisons Department and the file is under process. Mr. Rajesh said the TKA has constituted a reception committee comprising MP M. Muralimohan, sportsperson and City MLA Dr. Akula Satyanaryana, MLCs Somu Veerraju, Adireddy Apparao and Mayor Pantam Rajani.12 Stateshave already confirmed their participationin the tournament
