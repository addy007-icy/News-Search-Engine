The establishment of International Higher Academic Zones and an Academic City in Kerala will usher in considerable private investment reducing the State’s burden.The institutions in these zones will have to rely on excellence for survival and so will be responsive to emerging trends in education, the theme paper for the upcoming Global Education Meet (GEM) of the State government reads.Their establishment can “instil an entrepreneurial mindset in the higher education system and create a system that produces qualified personnel with a drive to create jobs, rather than mere jobseekers searching for a livelihood.” The zones and the city will enable a transition from the current centralised governance system to a new model based on academic autonomy within a regulatory framework. This will promote the flow of students from abroad, the paper reads.The establishment of the zones “will not be an excuse for the State to withdraw from the field of higher education altogether.” Rather, the State government needs to step up its investment in its universities and other institutions of higher learning. Even as importance is given to engineering and technology, medical sciences and nanosciences, equal significance needs to be given to fundamental sciences alongside social sciences, humanities, arts and culture studies, communication skills and other life skills.The zones and the city will be self-supporting and income generating. This might imply levy of high fee. Based on discussions with stakeholders, a sustainable revenue model needs to be developed, the paper says.The State should give the zones facilities and incentives on par with those offered in Special Export Processing Zones. This includes water supply, power, roads and exemption from registration fee and other taxes, subject to the condition that 25 per cent of the fee collected will be set apart for a scholarship fund.The major motivating factor for an investor will be the “aura of prestige” that the investing institution will acquire, the paper notes.
