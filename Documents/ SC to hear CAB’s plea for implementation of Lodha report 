The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear the plea of Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB) seeking implementation of the report of >Justice R.M. Lodha panel on reforms in Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).A bench headed by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur said that the date of hearing would be given on Friday evening itself after the counsel for CAB mentioned the matter for urgent hearing.The apex court-appointed Justice Lodha panel, which had suggested suspension of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years from participating in IPL, had on January 4 submitted its report to the Supreme Court.The three-member panel while recommending sweeping reforms in controversy-ridden BCCI had suggested a bar on ministers from occupying positions, putting a cap on the age and tenure of the office-bearers and legalising betting.The panel had also suggested that one unit should represent one state, while taking away the voting rights of institutional and city-based units.The committee had recommended restructuring of the BCCIâ€™s administrative set-up, proposing the position of a CEO accountable to a nine-member apex council.Earlier, the panel had suspended star-studded Dhoni-ed Chennai Super Kings (CSK), the most successful team of IPL, and Rajasthan Royals for two years from the League in a clean up of cricket following the 2013 betting scam involving their top officials Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra.Son-in-law of the then BCCI chief N Srinivasan, Meiyappan, a former Team Principal of India Cements Ltd (ICL)-owned franchise CSK and Kundra, co-owner of Jaipur IPL that runs Rajasthan Royals (RR), were suspended for life from any matches conducted by BCCI.
