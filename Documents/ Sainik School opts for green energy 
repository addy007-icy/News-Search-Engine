Sainik School, Vijayapura, one of the oldest defence schools of the country, has decided to adopt a green energy system for illuminating the campus and meet the electricity needs.The school has installed solar panels on the rooftop which generates 100 kW power.Principal Colonel Tamojeet Biswas said that since power generation was steadily increasing and even sources of non-renewable energy also decreasing, the need for switching over of renewable energy sources has assumed greater significance.“The school has launched this solar photovoltaic plant which is a leap towards sustainability, self sufficiency and energy efficiency. The school has taken this initiative to contribute by using renewable source of energy to meet its requirement for illuminating the classrooms and other purposes. The present investment on solar project will pay rich dividends in the long run,” he said.He said that by adopting solar energy system, the school wished to contribute its bit in bringing down global warming which has became a major cause of concern for environmentalist across the globe.“The government of Karnataka too has declared the year 2016 as ‘Energy Efficiency year’ by encouraging the people to adopt solar energy to make the state energy efficient. Our efforts are also going in the same direction,” Col. Biswas said.Col. Biswas informed that the present plant would meet the demands of the administrative building during the office hours.The excess power generated will be supplied to the HESCOM main grid. The school has replaced a number of conventional street lights with solar powered LED street lights. The Renewable Energy Department has provided 2000 LED bulbs at a subsidised rate.“We have started in a small manner, however as a broader plan, we would be going to make entire campus use only solar energy in the near future,” he asserted.
