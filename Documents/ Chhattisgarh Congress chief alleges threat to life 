Chhattisgarh State Congress president Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday alleged that “gunmen were roaming” in the capital Raipur after the “leaked tapes” saga, claiming that his life was under threat. He said the whistleblower responsible for leaking the tapes, Mr.Firoz Siddiqui, too was facing threats.Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Baghel said, “From the day the leaked tapes were made public, my security has been enhanced. It suggests that even the State government accepts that there is a threat to my life. We also hear these days that some gunmen are roaming in Raipur”.Mr. Baghel was central to the expulsion of senior Congress leader Ajit Jogi’s son Amit Jogi from the party earlier this week. He has also been pushing for senior Jogi’s removal from the party.“The name of the Chief Minister and other ministers cropped up in the leaked tapes. Attempts are made to bury this issue. The Prime Minister, who talks of clean administration,, should personally look into it,” Mr. Baghel said.“Although Siddiqui has been demanding protection, the Raman Singh government has not yet provided him any. Conspirators can go to any extent. There is a spate of political killings going on in the State. The Jiram Ghati killing of senior Congress leaders is still unsolved. I am not worried about my own life but I am concerned about the people of the State,” Mr. Baghel said.He also alleged that “talks of a plan” to assassinate a senior Congress leader from Delhi in a ‘Jiram Ghati-type attack’ were going on.
