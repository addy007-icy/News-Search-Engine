A man aged around 30 was shot dead by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the Pakistan border near Pathankot where the force is on high alert following the terror attack on the Air Force base there, early this month.The BSF contacted the Pakistan Rangers who refused to accept any intrusion from their side.Officials said the BSF team deployed along the International Border (IB) saw suspicious movement of at least three infiltrators near the Taash area in the Bamiyal sector early on Saturday morning and in order to thwart their bid to breach the border, the troops fired.“One intruder has been killed after he came in 5-10 metres inside the IB on the Indian side at 6 a.m. Two others accompanying the 30-year-old fled back,” the official said.
