The Delhi government’s appeal for surrendering surplus power may finally be heard with Telangana looking to avail the electricity produced at Dadri and Jhajjar power plants. At present, a major chunk of power produced at these two plants has been allocated to the Capital. Now, with Telangana expressing interest in procuring power from these units for a year, the AAP government has written to the Union Power Ministry asking it to reallocate power from NTPC’s Dadri Thermal Power Station and Aravali Power Company Limited’s plant in Jhajjar to the State.“Delhi is presently power surplus and the Govt of NCT of Delhi has been requesting the Ministry of Power, Govt of India, for surrender of surplus power. Therefore, the instant proposal of Telangana State Power Coordination Committee is in the interest of all parties concerned as on one hand the power deficit state of Telangana will get the requisite power and on the other hand consumers of Delhi will get relief from the burden of fixed cost of surplus power,” read the letter written by Principal Secretary (Power) Sukesh Jain on Tuesday.The offer from Telangana assumes significance for the Capital as the Delhi government had urged the Centre in earlier letters to permanently surrender 2,255 MW of electricity provided by 11 central government power plants.
