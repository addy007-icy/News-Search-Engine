Agricultural workers and landless labourers too are brought along with them.Those who do not own agriculture land thronged public parks and playgrounds to occupy every available shade to spend the day with their family members and friends. One of the features of the celebrations was the traditional culinary delights prepared for the occasion — the special roti prepared out of bajra dough and sesame seeds; home made butter along with the steam cooked jowar dough; and the special curry made out of pulses, including red gram, Bengal gram, horse gram and others and green vegetables, which is locally called ‘bhajji’.
