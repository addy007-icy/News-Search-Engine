The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee has alleged that the ongoing Janmabhoomi programme evoked poor response from the people as the government failed to redress their grievances submitted during the previous rounds of the programme.Opposition Leader in the Council C. Ramachandraiah had pooh-poohed the claims of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu that 96 per cent of the grievances were redressed by the government asserting that he would quit active politics if the government was able to prove this. The hollowness of the government’s claims on the Janmabhoomi programme was evident from the thin attendance being witnessed at the meetings and the manner in which the officials were being grilled by the people seeking solution to their problems.“Janmabhoomi programme has become a platform for the government to give publicity for itself,” he said wondering why the government was resorting to arrests of Opposition leaders ahead of the Janmabhoomi meetings if it was confident of effectively redressing public grievances.The Chief Minister was heaping insults on the Opposition leaders in violation of the spirit of democratic polity and he had no moral right to criticise the Opposition parties when he was not willing to seek their suggestions on the implementation of the welfare and developmental schemes.The secrecy that was being maintained over the location of plots that were promised to farmers who gave their lands for capital construction exposed the intentions of the government, he said.Ministers including P. Pulla Rao and P. Narayana were behaving irresponsibly when they were faced with angry farmers who volunteered to give their lands for the new capital, he alleged.
