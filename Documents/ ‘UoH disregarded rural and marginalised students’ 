The Indian People’s Tribunal has expressed concern over the disregard for students from rural and marginalised communities in the University of Hyderabad and said it requires systemic correction.A fact-finding team of Justice (retd) Suresh H; Sujata Surepalli, Editor Desi Disa; US Rao, Chairman CBC Federation; Meena Menon, researcher and Senior Advocate Gayatri Singh visited the University on January 25 and 26 and came to the conclusion that the death of Rohith Vemula was caused by acts of omission and commission of the authorities. The team met students, faculty, friends and family of Rohith Vemula and available administration authorities. In a report released to the media here, the committee recalled the series of events leading to the suicide of Rohith and felt that there was a clear abdication of duty from the office of the Vice-Chancellor in acting in the best interests of students and failing to take cognisance of recurring suicides by students from rural and marginalised communities. “Comprehensive investigations were taken up only in some cases is disturbing.”It said there was a preset agenda to target Rohith like taking cognisance on a complaint by a rank outsider, manipulation of facts and tampering with evidence. “The intervention of Bandaru Dattatreya and the Minister of HRD strengthen our view that the University was not concerned about an impartial investigation but was only keen to bend backwards to please the Minster of HRD,” it observed.The committee also maintained in its report that Vice-Chancellor suppressed the letter written by Rohith on December 18 raising the issue of social boycott refusing to invoke even basic protocols in such situations.It not only reflects the dereliction of duty but also constitutes grave contempt of the Orders of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, particularly in the conduct of the composition of the Committees, procedure mandated for incidents that may lead to expulsion and appellate provisions thereto, the report maintained. It said recommendations of the Proctoral Committee were shocking and that the Committee could prescribe such a punishment reflects their lack of understanding of the Constitution. The call of the Proctoral Committee to ban all associations on the basis of ideology, caste, religion reflects a deep rooted prejudice against politically active students and their associations, it observed. The report also observed that there is no effective administrative oversight to ensure timely payments fellowships to students from rural and marginalised communities. It favoured enactment of “Rohith Law” to ensure punitive action against the guilty.Fact-finding team submits its report on events leading to Rohith Vemula’s suicide
