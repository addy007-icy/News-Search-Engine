A traditional healer allegedly used a hot iron rod to brand a 22-day-old child, who was taken to him by his parents for treatment at a remote village in Odisha’s Koraput district.The child from Jhariguda village under Borigumma block was admitted to Jeypore hospital in a serious condition on Friday evening, doctors said.“The infection from the burns has spread in his body and some parts of his brain. The child is responding to treatment. Ulcers that had developed on his face have been cured. The child will be kept in the hospital for the next few days,” Child Specialist of Jeypore hospital Sandip Kumar Tripathy said.The child’s father, Khageswar Pradha, said as his son was unable to eat anything he had taken him to a traditional healer of the village a few days back. “The traditional healer branded him, but his condition deteriorated and we admitted him to hospital,” said Mr. Pradhan.“It has not been medically proven that illness is cured when you brand a child. Tribals continue to practise such methods due to lack to awareness,” doctors said.Last month, a 27-day-old child in Nabarangpur district was branded in a similar incident. - PTI“The infection from the burns spread in his body and some parts of brain”
