The implementation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s odd-even vehicle rationing scheme on Monday translated into brisk business for web app-based cab aggregation and car pooling services, their representatives claimed.Web-based app aggregators claimed they registered a rise in the usage of their platforms as soon as the road rationing scheme went live on January 1, with users accessing such platforms for sharing rides with other passengers on a gradually increasing basis.“The biggest growth is for trips between Delhi-Noida (400 per cent), Delhi-Gurgaon (150 per cent) and Noida-Gurgaon (100 per cent). Carpooling is enabling Delhiites to travel with ease during the odd-even road rationing dates,” long-distance ridesharing platform BlaBlaCar said in a statement.According to the data provided by the platform, the app saw a 66 percent growth in the number of seats available in Delhi-NCR this week compared to last week.“Delhi-specific routes witnessed a significant surge — nearly 70 per cent — in ridership. The Dwarka cluster fared the best in terms of increase in commuters,” said Amit Singh, the co-founder of mobile-based minibus service Shuttl. He claimed they provide nearly 15,000 rides daily on an average.Meanwhile, cab aggregator Ola said it saw tremendous response to shared mobility categories like Ola share, car pool and Ola shuttle.“We are already seeing a double-digit growth in demand across various categories over the last week in Delhi-NCR, with tens of thousands of vehicles active on the app. We are optimistic about initiatives like car/cab-pooling and the ongoing odd-even experiment contributing to a pollution-free Delhi in the time to come,” said a company spokesperson.However, there were also complaints of overcharging by both taxi-hailing apps and radio taxi cabs, with both taking refuge under surge pricing which, predictably, all company representatives either refused to comment on or chose to deny.
