Finally breaking the AAP government’s silence about the second phase of the odd-even scheme, Transport Minister Gopal Rai said the anti-pollution experiment would be enforced again after March.Speaking at the Delhi Secretariat on Saturday, Mr. Rai said the Delhi government is working on the modalities of the scheme.He reiterated his stand that the policy has had a significant impact on congestion on the Capital’s streets.“The government is still collating and interpreting data, but we might actually be able to see a repeat of the odd-even scheme after March,” Mr. Rai said.“We are seeking solutions to issues such as the possibility of drivers purchasing more cars to claim exemption and the availability of school buses to add to the fleet of State-run vehicles during the implementation of the scheme in future,” he added.Speaking about implementation and enforcement of the odd-even scheme, the Transport Minister equated it to Mahatma Gandhi’s satyagraha, with a trial run forming the core of a similar anti-pollution measure in the future.“What if Mahatma Gandhi had not organised the satyagraha fearing that not many people would march with him? He didn’t care for that, the rest is history. Not just in terms of a positive effect on congestion here in Delhi, the scheme has shown governments across the country that if the will exists even seemingly drastic measures meant to ensure public good can and will be supported wholeheartedly by the people,” Mr. Rai said.The Transport Minister also said that the government had planned to add 3,000 new buses to the fleet of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) this year, besides introducing premium buses for the “well-off” residents to augment public transport and attract more to turn to buses.Mr. Rai added that while 1,000 of these buses would be run under the cluster system and would ply on roads around April or May this year, as many as 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses will hit the streets from August.A Cabinet note to this effect has been prepared by the department and is expected to be passed later this month.“Under the Premium Bus Service we will run 1,000 buses by the end of this year.These buses will have ACs, water, magazines, marshals, wi-fi and other facilities,” he said, adding that these buses would ply on select routes where the “elite class” live and work and would also allow advance online booking.The AAP government is looking to introduce premium buses for “well-off” residents of the city
