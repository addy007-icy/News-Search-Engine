The allotment of special funds for the proper upkeep of toilets in government schools has come as a relief to students, staff, parents and also the educationists alike. However, a cross section of the rural people says that many government schools do not have adequate toilets.Even if they have toilets, there is no proper facility in them. They urged the government to construct adequate toilet blocks in the schools.The authorities should ensure proper water connection to the toilets, without which they will not be of any help.The government should launch a survey to identify the schools which do not account for adequate toilets and construct facility immediately, say members of Parent-Teachers Associations.The government could use the MP / MLA Local Area Development Fund for the construction of toilets in the government educational institutions, say people.The government could also rope in voluntary agencies such as Rotary, Lions and JCI clubs in this project.It may be mentioned that the JCI India recently constructed a record number of 5,700 toilet blocks, each block comprising three toilets, in schools in backward areas across the country under its ‘Samadhan’ project. Each toilet block was constructed at Rs. 75,000.
