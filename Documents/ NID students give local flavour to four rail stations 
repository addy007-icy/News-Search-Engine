Students from the National Institute of Design (NID) have conceptualised and designed logos and signage for four railway stations between Bengaluru and Mysuru: Srirangapatna, Channapatna, Pandavapura, and Ramanagaram. This was the outcome of one of the 28 workshops that were part of the 2016 Annual International Open Elective, conducted by NID across its campuses in Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.The theme of the two-week series, which concluded on Friday, was ‘Design for Railways’.For the four Karnataka stations, students gave their work a local flavour, and travelled to various cities and towns and spoke to locals about the history, culture and workforce. The feel of the Channapatna station has been designed keeping in mind the wooden toys that the town is famous for.Ramanagaram has been linked to silk and Sholay hills; Srirangapatna derives inspiration from Tipu Sultan and Ranganathaswamy Temple, while Pandavapura’s design draws inspiration from the Pandavas, Melkote Temple and KRS Dam. Based on the ideas and concepts that have been designed, V. Ravishankar — who anchored the workshops for NID Bangalore — said that he would write proposals to the Indian Railways to implement the same.This exercise is the result of a memorandum of understanding between NID and Indian Railways.Sanjeev Agarwal, Divisional Railway Manager of South Western Railways, who saw the work of the students and the faculty, said that it was a novel concept. Branding of stations was an interesting concept, which they hoped to implement after sorting out the logistics.Siddharth Vakkaleri, a first year masters student in transport and automobile design from NID Gandhinagar, who was involved in the Ramanagaram project, explored the town and spoke to people to get a vibe of the place.It was only then that he designed the logo, merchandise and signage. Some of the projects that the design students worked on include signage and branding of stations, tech interventions in compartments to enhance communication between passengers as well as redesigning the IRCTC website.Theme of the two-week series that concluded on Friday was ‘Design for Railways’Students travelled to various cities and spoke to locals about the history, culture and workforceSanjeev Agarwal, Divisional Railway Manager of South Western Railways, terms the work of students and faculty a novel concept
