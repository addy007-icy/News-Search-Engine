Installing CCTVs at the workplace and publishing telephone numbers do not ensure transparency, Director General of Police Jacob Thomas, who is now Chairman and Managing Director of Kerala Police Construction Corporation, has said.“The measures are inadequate to wipe out corruption and are aimed at creating a feeling that everything is transparent. Any misuse of one’s position for personal gain is corruption. Preventing a person from acting against corruption is yet another form of corruption,” he said during a workshop on ‘Corruption and a Vigilant Media’ organised here by the Ernakulam Press Club on Saturday. Under the present circumstances, CCTVs are needed across the State since bribes can be paid anywhere. Calling for an all-out fight against corruption, Mr. Thomas said officials must not be pawns in the hands of politicians. “No official is bound to obey illegal orders of politicians, even if the orders are repeated one hundred times.Any illegality is a challenge to rule of law. Sadly, only 10 per cent of officials are efficient and non-corrupt in Kerala. The claim of politicians that they are the sole protectors of democracy is untrue,” he said.Mr. Thomas called upon mediapersons to focus on the charges levelled against the accused rather than probe the antecedents of accusers. “Ninety-nine per cent of officials who share information with mediapersons are corrupt. They use the media as a cover to hide their misdeeds. They even go to the extent of bribing them to cover up their misdeeds and know how to hide their ill-gotten wealth. Those who do not toe their line are isolated.”Preventing a person from acting against corruption is yet another form of corruption, he says
