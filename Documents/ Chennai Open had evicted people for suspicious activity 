Disgraced Austrian tennis player Daniel Koellerer’s claim that he had turned down an approach to throw a match against Nikolay Davydenko at the Chennai Open in 2009 is not the tournament’s only brush with the sport’s ugly side.(Koellerer told the BBC, during its match-fixing investigation with Buzzfeed, that he was offered bribes in Moscow, Chennai and Paris.)According to the Chennai Open’s organising committee chairman, Karti P. Chidambaram, a few years ago the tournament acted on information shared by the ATP to evict people who were passing scores from courtside in an attempt to profit from the delay in the official website’s updating of ‘live’ scores.Asked about the logistical difficulties of preventing corruption during the conduct of the tournament, Karti said: “It is impossible to monitor every action of a player and who he/she talks to.”He added that during the ATP’s quarterly meetings, the tournament organisers and players were routinely briefed and sensitised about these matters, including the various ways of spotting suspicious activity.With the Tennis Integrity Unit coming in for criticism for being a toothless body, Karti said: “No amount of funding increase or having extra officers is going to make a huge difference as it is difficult to spot whether a player double-faults or hits wide by few centimetres on purpose. The onus is on the players to act in the spirit of the game and report any approaches to fix matches to the concerned authorities.”
