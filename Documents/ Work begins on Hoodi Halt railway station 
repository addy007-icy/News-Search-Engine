The protests demanding a halt railway station at Hoodi for the last one year culminated in the beginning of the work on the project on Saturday.Hoodi Halt railway station that will come up between K.R. Puram and Whitefield railway stations will help more than 20,000 techies commuting to the area every day. Now one can travel from Bengaluru City, Bengaluru Cantonment and Byappanahalli railway stations on Bangarpet Passenger or Marikuppam Passenger trains to Hoodi and avoid the crippling traffic snarls on Outer Ring Road and K.R. Puram to reach their workplaces.P.C. Mohan, Bengaluru (Central) MP, laid the foundation stone for the station work on Saturday. Presently, most of the techies who travel by train have to get down at the good-shed yard, where trains stop briefly. The regular commuters had sent several petitions demanding a halt station at Hoodi and had even staged protests in December 2014. They found support in Mr. Mohan, who sanctioned Rs. 1.74 crore from his MPLAD funds for the project.It will come up between K.R. Puram and Whitefield stations
