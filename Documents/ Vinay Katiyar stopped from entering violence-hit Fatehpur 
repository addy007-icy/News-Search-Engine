BJP leader Vinay Katiyar was on Monday taken into custody while trying to enter Fatehpur where communal clashes had taken place during a ‘shobha yatra’ on the occasion of Makar Sankranti.On the direction of the Fatehpur administration, Mr Katiyar was taken into custody when he was trying to enter the neighbouring district, Kanpur SSP Shalabh Mathur told PTI.“He was taken to circuit house here and will be soon sent to Lucknow,” Mr Mathur said.Soon after Mr Katiyar was detained, BJP workers gathered at the spot and raised slogans against the police and the district administration.Alleging the Fatehpur administration of harassing members of majority community following the clashes, Mr Katiyar asked, “Why no security arrangements were made for the annual yatra which is being taken out for the last 38 years on the occasion of Makar Sankranti”.The BJP leader said he was going to Fatehpur to collect details of the alleged harassment but police took him into custody here on the directives of the Fatehpur administration.He demanded an impartial probe in the matter.Tension gripped Fatehpur on January 14 when bricks were hurled by members of two communities during the annual ‘shobha yatra’ in Kazipura Kasauli locality under Kasba Jehanabad police station area.Trouble erupted when the shobha yatra deviated from its traditional route and a section of people from another community objected as the procession also displayed a model of proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya.Incidentally, VHP leader Pravin Togadia and Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjana Jyoti were in the town to attend a ‘Hindu Sangam’ programme at Ram Talaiya temple, also in Jehanabad.Mr Togadia said that clashes took place before his speech and district administration is responsible for it. – PTIThe BJP leader was taken to the circuit house here and will be soon sent to Lucknow
