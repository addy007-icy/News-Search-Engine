It’s that time of the year when film stars step out of their film sets and head to cricket grounds…. to have a ball. It’s time for Celebrity Cricket League, which is in its sixth edition this year.For audiences who love cricket and cinema, the CCL has proved, over the years, to be an entertaining proposition. Providing this ‘cricketainment’ seems to be on top of the mind for stars this season as well.The Chennai bunch of actors has done reasonably well, especially in the first few editions, thanks to the exploits of actors like Vishnu Vishal and Vikranth. This season, the team, comprising some new players as well, are under captain Jiiva and are raring to go. “We actors always look forward to this season to have some fun at the ground and bond with our colleagues from different industries,” said Jiiva, “The Chennai squad is among the liveliest bunch; we sometimes party hard and play a good match the next day itself. With the inclusion of some new actors in the team, we’re looking to play our best this time around too.”The tournament, which kickstarts next weekend in Bangalore, will be played over four weeks in many venues including Kochi, Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Eight teams from different industries, including new team Punjab, will battle it out this season that will see about 15 games over the course of four weeks.
