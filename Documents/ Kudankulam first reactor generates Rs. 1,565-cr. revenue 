The first reactor of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP), which is being prepared for the second fuel cycle operation following refuelling, has so far generated 687.50 crore units of electricity to ensure a whopping revenue of Rs. 1,565 crore.In a statement, Site Director, KKNPP, R.S. Sundar said that after the first reactor was shut down for the scheduled annual outage on June 23 last, refuelling of the reactor had been completed and the systems normalised.“As per the standard safety practices, steam release devices in the steam lines will be tested shortly by opening safety valves. During the test, ambient noise level may marginally go up due to the steam release into the atmosphere. Since these tests will be conducted only during daytime, there is no need for concern or panic. No test is being conducted at KKNPP, which is harmful to the environment and the public,” Mr. Sundar said.
