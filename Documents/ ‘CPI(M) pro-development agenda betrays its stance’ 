: Minister for Culture, Planning and Economic Affairs K.C. Joseph has termed the CPI(M)’s espousal of the development agenda at the Kerala Studies Congress “an open admission of guilt.”The party has realised, though belatedly, that its resistance to change had turned the clock back for the State, posing a setback to development, he said while addressing a press conference here on Monday.“After opposing computerisation of government services and mechanisation of farming all these years, it has now realised its folly.”Mr. Joseph said the resolution adopted by the Study Congress was nothing but a version of the UDF manifesto and Vision 2030 document of the government.It was the UDF government that provided the impetus for the Kannur airport and Kochi metro projects that had been bogged down during the previous LDF regime. The UDF, he added, was against mingling development with politics.
