The Kerala High Court on Thursday stayed a government order authorising District Collectors to allow mining, establishment of crusher units or the establishment of any auxiliary industrial units on the government land assigned under the Kerala Land Assignment Act and Rules to various persons.The court passed the stay order on a petition filed by Manu Anand of Kochi. According to him, the Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964 stipulated that the government lands which had been assigned should be used only for the purpose of personal cultivation or as housing sites. Therefore, the order was against the rules and would defeat the very purpose of the Land Assignment Act and Rules. Besides, the government had issued the order without amending the Act or Rules.The petitioner also pointed out that the nature of these assigned land was forest where no mining or industrial activities could be undertaken without obtaining the prior permission from the Centre under the Forest Conservation Act.
