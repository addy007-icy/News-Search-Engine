The former Union Minister and Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, M. Mallikarjun Kharge, has expressed disgust over the alleged influence of money in elections and said that the current trend of moneybags winning elections is a threat to the very foundation of democracy.Speaking at the function to mark the inauguration of development works worth Rs. 184.88 crore in Chittapur taluk in Chittapur town in Kalaburagi district on Monday, he said that the outcome of the elections to the Legislative Council from the local bodies constituency was a pointer to the fact that the money power was gaining an upper hand in elections.“The performance of the Congress candidate and the State government and its efforts to strengthen urban and rural local bodies was not a criteria for the voters, at least in Kalaburagi-Yadgir constituency from where a BJP candidate has been elected. This is a defeat of democracy,” Mr. Kharge said.He said that this sort of outcome would dissuade honest people and those who believe in integrity to take up development works in their respective constituency.They might adopt illegal means to earn money to use it as an investment in the elections and win it.“The voters will also have no moral right to demand work from the elected representatives after accepting gratification from him or her during the elections.”Mr. Kharge said that the UPA government in its second term had taken up many welfare schemes for the poor and farmers.However, it was defeated in the Lok Sabha elections and this only showed that the voters did not weigh the performance of the government and fell prey to mere rhetoric of the Opposition parties.
