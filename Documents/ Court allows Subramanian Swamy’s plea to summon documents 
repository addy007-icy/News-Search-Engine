A Delhi court today allowed the plea of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy seeking summoning of documents from the Ministries of Finance, Urban Development and Corporate Affairs, Income Tax Department and other agencies in the National Herald case.Metropolitan Magistrate Lovleen asked Mr. Swamy to file the process fee for sending summons to these departments, including Delhi Development Authority and the Registrar of Companies. During the brief hearing, Mr. Swamy told the court he needed these documents, which are in the custody of these Ministries, for advancing arguments in the case. “They (these ministries and agencies) have the documents. I do not know what all documents they have. These documents can be summoned,” Mr. Swamy told the court.“You file the PF (process fee). Your application is allowed,” the judge said. The court had on December 19, 2015, granted bail to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi and three others — Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes and Suman Dubey — who had appeared before in pursuance to the summons issued earlier.Sam Pitroda, another accused, was granted exemption from personal appearance for that day only on medical grounds.The case is based on a private criminal complaint lodged by Mr. Swamy against them of cheating, conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.
