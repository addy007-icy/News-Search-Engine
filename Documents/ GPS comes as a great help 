The Global Positioning System (GPS) installed in almost all the buses operated by KSRTC in Mysuru on intra-city routes has helped the authorities concerned to identify deviation on designated routes . In case of closure of roads due to works, KSRTC reschedules the route accordingly and communicates the same to its staff. Recently, a few buses deviated from the designated route and chose ‘shortcuts’ identified on the ‘Mysuru Transport Map.’ The GPS helped to track the buses and their movement. “When the buses were found moving on undesignated routes, the system was immediately set right by talking to the drivers. This is how technology has come to our aid,” an official said.
