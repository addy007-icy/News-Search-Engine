Whether a weekday or a weekend, the city seems to get no break from clogged roads. While on weekdays, the city’s clogged roads present the frustration of commuting to office; on weekends, particularly during the evening, vehicular movement comes to a standstill in the Central Business District and major roads leading out of the city.The culprit: private buses. Even at 11 p.m. on Sunday, Basaveshwara circle and Mekhri Circle on Airport Road see slow moving traffic as private buses stop to pick up passengers headed towards Hyderabad; around M.G. Road and K.R. Puram, buses to Chennai and Tirupathi buses cause vehicle pile up. Near Kempegowda bus stand, numerous private buses end up clogging Dhanvanthri Road, S.C. Road and the narrow bylanes between these two.“Currently, these buses have contract carriage permits and they can move anywhere within the city. This has caused problems, particularly in the Majestic area, where they are parked,” said Mohammad Saleem, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic). As a solution, the traffic police has written to the Transport Department recently to modify the conditions mentioned in the contract permits, which need to be renewed almost yearly. “We have requested them to add a condition that these private buses can start their trips only at the Outer Ring Road. This will ensure that they do not traverse on inner roads of the city,” he said.(Reporting by Mohit M. Rao)Several spots on Airport Road see slow moving traffic due to private buses
