In an age when science and technology is making rapid strides, people still appear to commit suicides under the alleged spell of sorcery and black magic.In one such incident at Abidnagar under Fourth Town Police Station limits, a mother and son had reportedly committed suicide in a pact and the police strongly believe that the belief in sorcery and black magic had forced them to take the extreme step.M. Kamala (48) and her son M. Ravi Kumar (30), a software engineer, committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling fan. The duo would have committed the act on Saturday, but in came to light only on Monday, after Kamalaâ€™s husband M. Maheswara Rao returned home from Vizianagaram and found that the door was bolted from inside.Presuming something was foul, Maheswara Rao alerted the police and the police broke open the door to find both the mother and son hanging from the ceiling fan.According to the police, the entire family was living in depression, ever since their eldest son M. Kanaka Raju had committed suicide in the same house about two years ago.The family had kept the body of Kanaka Raju for about three days without informing the neighbours or the police at that time. They believed that someone had cast an evil eye on the family and had severed all relations with the neighbours and relatives.In fact, Maheswara Rao had gone to Srikakulam and Viziangaram to find a sorcerer to rid the family of the evil spell.The bodies were shifted to King George Hospital for post-mortem and the police have registered a case under Section 174 of Cr PC (suspicious death) and investigation is on.The police suspect that belief inblack magic forced them to take theextreme step
