An undertrial gave the slip to two police constables escorting him to jail from a court and fled from Kempegowda Bus Station on Saturday.Interestingly, the same undertrial had given the slip to Tumakuru police last year while being escorted for a court appearance. He was later arrested and lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison Complex at Parappana Agrahara here. The undertrial, Kiran (22), was arrested in connection with a murder case registered at Adugodi in 2015. He also has two theft cases against him in Tiptur. Two constables had taken Kiran to Tiptur for a court appearance in connection with a theft case on Friday and returned by bus to the city. As they got down from a KSRTC bus and were trying to board a BMTC bus at the KBS, the Kiran, who was handcuffed, pushed the constable holding the chain, making him lose the grip and fall down. Kiran fled from the spot along with the handcuff and chain, sources said.The constables tried to search for him in vain. A case has been registered at Upparapet Police Station.
