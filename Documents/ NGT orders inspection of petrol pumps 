Adulteration of petrol and diesel at fuel stations has caught the attention of the National Green Tribunal, which on Monday directed inspection of petrol pumps across Delhi-NCR.A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar constituted a committee comprising officials from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Petroleum and Gas and concerned state pollution control boards to conduct joint inspection at any 10 petrol pumps.The green panel also directed authorities to carry out surprise inspection of 50 two and four-wheelers in Delhi-NCR to ascertain their emission levels.“Let the committee comply with our order sensu stricto (strict sense). They would take fuel samples and analyse the same in the laboratory of the state concerned and Central Pollution Control Board. Samples should also be taken from NCR,” the Bench said while posting the matter for next hearing on February 16.The directions came while hearing a plea filed by Delhi resident Cherub Singla seeking directions to inspect the fuel quality at petrol pumps across the country, especially in cities facing acute air pollution.Mr Singla has contended that fuel adulteration increases the emission of total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter and thus adds to air pollution.Alleging that weak regulatory regime has allowed the “adulteration racket” to flourish, the petition has sought immediate closure of petrol pumps and other intermediate agencies found dealing with adulterated fuels and imposition of severe penalty on them. - PTIGreen panel focuses on checking adulteration of petrol and diesel
