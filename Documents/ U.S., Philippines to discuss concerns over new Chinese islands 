An official says Philippine and U.S. foreign and defence chiefs will discuss new security concerns arising from Chinaâ€™s completion of artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea.Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Charles Jose said the Philippines will ask the United States to continue patrols to ensure freedom of navigation in the disputed waters when Defence Secretary Voltaire Gazmin and Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario meet their American counterparts on Tuesday in Washington.Mr. Jose said on Monday that recent Chinese flights to test a runway on one of the man-made islands, Fiery Cross, have raised concerns that Beijing may plan to impose an air defence identification zone over the South China Sea, officially or otherwise.
