A day after National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah warmed to the BJP over government formation in Jammu & Kashmir, the party working president Omar Abdullah on Sunday said “there was no change in the NC stand on coalition with the BJP.”“All he has said is that if any proposal comes from the BJP, it will be discussed by the Working Committee of the party for a decision. He hasn’t sought an alliance nor has he promised any support. Only consideration & discussion,” clarified junior Abdullah on Twitter.Mr. Farooq Abdullah, while speaking to the media in Jammu on Saturday, had said: “If such a proposal [from the BJP] comes, then the NC will call a meeting. If such a situation arises, NC can think it over. We have not closed the doors on the BJP.”His remarks have come at a time when the NC is building its political capital in the State over the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alliance with the BJP.Besides senior leaders, a team of dedicated online NC leaders have , for the past nine months, taken to the social networking sites to attack the PDP for providing a rare chance to the BJP to rule the country’s only Muslim-majority State.To douse the political storm whipped up by Mr. Farooq Abdullah, the NC also issued a formal statement on Facebook: “The Working Committee in its recent meeting in Srinagar had endorsed the decision taken by the NC a year ago to stay away from the BJP. We expect no change in that decision.”It said the PDP was an ally of the BJP and the NC was not obliged “to rescue either the PDP or the BJP” from the stalemate in their alliance.
