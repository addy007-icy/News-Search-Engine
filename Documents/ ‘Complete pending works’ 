Chitradurga Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Nitish Patil has instructed officials to concentrate on completing pending projects in the district.Speaking at Karnataka Development Programme review meeting here on Monday, he said that the zilla panchayat engineering division had taken up construction of overhead tanks at many places, but steps had not been taken to connect pipelines to these tanks even after six months of completing the works. Expressing displeasure over the delay in drilling borewells under the Ganga Kalyan scheme for 2012-13, Mr. Patil said that the officials should take steps to fix responsibility on the agency which was entrusted with the task of drilling borewells and complete the works as early as possible. “The officers of every department should bring in detail the progress of works taken up during the month to every meeting and clarify the doubts of members and higher authorities,” he added.
