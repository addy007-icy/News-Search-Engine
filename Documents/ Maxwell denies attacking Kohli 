Swashbuckling Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell on Friday dismissed reports that he had criticised Virat Kohli, saying it was “completely untrue” and the Australian team was actually “in awe” of the India Test captain.Despite nursing a bruised tendon above his right knee and a sore left hamstring, which rendered him doubtful for the fifth and final ODI in Sydney on Saturday, Maxwell took to social media to clear the air about the reports.“Taken out of context... I also complimented him (Kohli) on how well he had played and got his team into a winning position,” Maxwell wrote on his twitter handle on Friday.Taken out of context...

He surpassed the feat of Sachin Tendulkar who achieved it in 1998 in 234 innings.Further clarifying his comments, the 27-year-old Maxwell said: “The point that I was making, and it related more to when India were setting totals and had plenty of wickets in hand, is that the scoring rate seemed to slow as milestones got close, which can sometimes be the case, especially when teams are batting first.“Maintaining a constant scoring rate can be less straightforward batting first than when you’re chasing and you know what the required rate has to be, and there have been times when batters just seem to have slowed a bit to make sure they reach those milestones.”“Sometimes that wins you games, and sometimes it doesn’t but that was the only point I was trying to make. I’ve got a really good relationship with Virat off the field and I’ve already had a chat with him,” Maxwell added.Kohli has been involved in a number of volatile exchanges with Australia players in recent years, most recently in a series of running verbal battles with all-rounder James Faulkner.But Maxwell quashed any suggestions that there was any bad blood between Kohli and Australia players, who has succeeded World Cup-winning captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as Test skipper.“Everyone wants to play like Virat does. As a team, we have enormous respect for him largely because he goes about his cricket in much the same way as we do. He’s a hard competitor on the field but very fair, and he loves to give as good as he gets,” Maxwell said.“Plus he takes the opposition on and that always earns you huge respect from Australian players and fans. There’s no doubt that during this ODI series everyone’s enjoyed the way that he’s taken on the role of aggressor, and the battles he’s had with James Faulkner have been a real highlight.“And off the field, he’s really likeable, he’s got a great personality and he’s happy to show that which makes him one of those guys that people can relate to,” he said.Dhoni has come under a lot of flak for India’s loss in the ODI series but Maxwell defended the Indian ODI skipper.“I think everyone is unbelievably harsh on M.S. Dhoni. If he vacates that middle-order, it leaves their batting even more thin with the inexperienced guys they’ve brought in,” he said.“With four years until the next World Cup, it’s probably the perfect time now to bring in young guys and give them a chance to stake their claim but unfortunately for India they can’t realistically break up the middle-order like we were able to.”
