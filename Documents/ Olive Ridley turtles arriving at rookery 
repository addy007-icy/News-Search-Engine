Mating of Olive Ridleys is continuing in the sea near Rushikulya rookery coast in Ganjam district of Odisha, although due to some reasons it was delayed this year.At present mating couples are seen in sea too close to the coastline. Hundreds of these reptile pairs are being seen at a distance of just one km from the Rushikulya rookery coast. According to local fishermen these pairs as well as single turtles are being seen in thousands in sea till 10 km from coastline.Although the large number of Olive Ridleys have gathered at this coast and mating has been delayed by almost 15 days this season, said Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer Ashis Behera.Usually mating season of Olive Ridleys at this coast ends by January and the males return, while the females stay back for nesting at Rushikulya rookery coast. But this year the mating is still continuing in January.This hints that this year their nesting at Rushikulya rookery coast may get delayed by 15 days or more, said the DFO. Usually mother Olive Ridleys have gestation period of around 50 days and after that they lay their eggs.The forest department has taken strict measures to protect the Olive Ridleys in sea near the rookery.A major cause of deaths of Olive Ridleys at this coast is illegal entry of fishing trawlers into this region where fishing by mechanised trawlers is banned during congregation, mating, nesting and hatching period.The forest department patrols the sea here by two speed boats and two trawlers. One fishing trawler that was illegally fishing in the region was seized. Following the seizure, illegal entry of fishing trawlers here has stopped, said the DFO.This year some dolphins are also being seen in the sea amid thousands of turtles, said Rabindranath Sahu of Rushikulya Sea Turtle Protection Committee (RSTPC).The forest department has established nine camps on the coastline near the rookery to monitor and protect these endangered marine turtles. Artificial hatcheries are also being set up as there are chances of sporadic nesting soon.The coast near Rushikulya rookery is one of the major nesting sites of Olive Ridleys on Indian coastline. In 2015, mass nesting had occurred at Rushikulya rookery coast from March 11 to 18.Around 3,10,000 female Olive Ridleys had laid eggs at Rushikulya rookery coast.
