In April last, The Hindu had exposed some gross irregularities in the judging of Bharatanatyam (High School girls) at the 55th State School Arts Festival at Kozhikode. The score sheet, which we had published along with the report, had shown how one of the judges was overenthusiastic to ensure that one contestant came first.She was given 19 marks by the judge for footwork (one of the six aspects), in which the maximum stipulated is 15. She was also gifted further five marks while adding up the marks for six aspects calculating her total score. She thus finished with a score of 99 out of 100, when it should have only been 90.‘An eye-opener’That judge is not there this time around, much to the delight of several dance teachers and parents. “ The Hindu report was an eye-opener and the All Kerala Dance Teachers’ Association had produced it before the Directorate of Public Instruction, while we made a list of corrupt judges,” said Girija Chandran.
