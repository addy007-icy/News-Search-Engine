The Telangana State government would invite Union Minister Joel Oram for the Medaram Sammakka Sarakka Jatara and request him to accord it the national festival status later, said MP K. Kavitha here on Saturday.Speaking to newsmen, she said the State government had sanctioned over Rs. 100 crore for the arrangements while preparations such as civil works and others were going on since many months. Earlier, the governments used to sanction inadequate funds just a few days before the jatara.However, in the separate Telangana State, the government has taken keen interest in ensuring smooth passage of the jatara and in a fitting manner.Ms. Kavitha said she had interacted with District Collector Vakati Karuna and came to know about the arrangements being made for the jatara at Medaram village.“We will also follow it up with the Central government on securing the jatara the national festival status later,” she said. She was here to take part in the 5th National Women Convention being organised by the TNGOs’ Association on NIT campus.When asked about the mysterious death of two tribal girls, she refused to say anything stating that the investigation was under way and so it was not proper to speak on the issue now.On the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections, Ms. Kavitha said the party hoped that people would give clear verdict as they did in the Warangal Parliament elections recently.
