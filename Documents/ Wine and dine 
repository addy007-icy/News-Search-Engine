Is there an ideal way to drink wine? We often hear one must swirl, smell and sip to savour it. Wine connoisseur Sheetal Munshaw, though, thinks such wine etiquettes must not come in the way of enjoying wine. “It should be drunk the way you want to. The rules make it more pleasurable, but these are not restrictive.”She agrees, though, that wine must be had chilled. “Temperature is critical. Wine has got properties of fruit in it and tastes best at a particular temperature,” says Sheetal, who is also Director-India, Atout, France. As for swirling wine before drinking it, she says: “Wine is a living liquid, so by swirling it, you allow it to breathe. Though there is this whole romance around wine, it should not restrict your experience of savouring it.”Sheetal was in town recently at Olive Beach for a five-course sit down dinner, organised by The Active Holiday Company, showcasing hand-picked French wine, such as Vallon Grand Reserve White, Frey Sohler Sylvane, Touraine Gamay and Cotes Du Rhone. The wines were from different regions of France, which reflected the diversity of the country. “Wine is a beverage that has a character on the nose,” explains Sheetal. “Wine from the Alsace region goes particularly well with Indian food. The wine is fruity that complements our spicy cuisine. Cotes du Rhone wine, a blend of grape varieties, is not too tannic or robust and can be pared with stronger cuisines.”Estelle Le Lan from France, who was at the dinner, explained how wine is savoured among the French. “Wine is all about savouring and sharing. You enjoy wine better with food, but there are no compulsions. Aperitif or apero is a huge thing in France. People gather to enjoy the moments of drinking wine together.”
