After the tussle with Bangalore Electricity Supply Company over the use of electricity poles for drawing television cables, cable operators are now up in arms against Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).Alleging that BBMP authorities were cutting off cables (optical fibre cables or OFCs) drawn through lamp posts, the Karnataka State Cable TV Operators’ Association petitioned Energy Minister D.K. Shivakumar on Friday seeking a solution to the problem. The “unfair” cutting off of cables was resulting in waste of time, resources and money for cable operators, besides inconveniencing customers, the association said.“The BBMP authorities simply cut off the cables … and it takes us close to seven hours to restore the disrupted connections. The BBMP, instead of cutting off cables, can levy a penalty,” suggested V.S. Patrick Raju, president of the association.He said cable operators were not able to use electricity poles, as Bescom had forbidden it, citing safety issues.Mayor B.N. Manjunath Reddy said, “The cables are overcrowding the lamp posts. They can also be found bunched on trees and even on the pavements. This is leading to severe safety issues, not to mention the loss of revenue.”BBMP officials, cable operators’ association representatives and Mr. Shivakumar are scheduled to meet on Monday to find a solution to the problem.
