The PDP and the BJP on Saturday dismissed speculation about any differences or new conditions between them over formation of new government in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of death of Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.“There are certainly no conditions from our side and there was no meeting of our leaders on government formation.“We respect the right of the bereaved family of Mufti Sahib to mourn his death,” BJP State president Sat Paul Sharma told PTI.Mr. Sharma said he had received a letter from the Governor on government formation but the party will take a decision on it only after the fourth day ceremony of Sayeed’s death is observed on Sunday.“There is no hurry on this issue. We will definitely be meeting after tomorrow’s ceremony for Mufti Sahib and take a decision,” he said.Mr. Sharma said it was a “historic” coalition between the BJP and the PDP in the State and “we would like it continue”.“We are interested in peace and development in the state and we want this coalition to continue on this path shown by Mufti Mohammd Sayeed,” he added.Senior PDP leader and former Education Minister Naeem Akhtar also dismissed suggestions about any conditions set by either this party or the BJP for forming the new government.“Mehbooba ji is still mourning the great loss... Mufti sahib was not only her father but guide, mentor and inspiration.“We are not in any condition to discuss government formation at this moment so how can there be any talk of conditions,” Mr. Akhtar said.He said the party leadership including the president will discuss and decide on government formation at an .“appropriate time”.
