However, with recruitment of new surveyors, the work had picked up and 80 per cent of property had been surveyed.Mr. Qamarul said that the Deputy Commissioners have completed the validation of survey taluk-wise in some taluks and submitted reports to the government and the process of issuing taluk-wise gazette notification with due validation of the revenue authorities has started.He said that as per the 1954 Act, every 10 year, one Wakf survey should be taken up but except for one survey during 1965-68, no survey had been done in the State. Even this survey done by the Wakf department was not upheld by different courts and this made the Union government to amend the Wakf Act in 2013 making it mandatory for the State governments to conduct re-survey of Wakf property and get it validated by the Revenue authorities.“The Deputy Commissioners have started the validation processand I am confident that the validation of the entire Wakf property will be completed within four months,” he said.Validation has been completed in some taluks and Deputy Commissioners have submitted reports
