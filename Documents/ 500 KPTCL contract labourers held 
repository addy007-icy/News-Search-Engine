Over 500 contractor labourers of Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited have been detained by the police after they tried to storm the residence of the Chief Minister demanding regularisation of services.The protesters said that over 8,000 contractor employees are working for various corporations across the State for the past 20 years. Instead of regularising their services, the government is going in for fresh recruitment as a result of which thousands of workers are expected to lose their jobs.The association of contract employees has earlier submitted a memorandum to the government and got assurances that the contract employees would not be terminated, but the recent decision on fresh appointments had rendered the contract labourers unemployed and their families are suffering, All India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC) State secretary K. Somashekhar, who is leading the protest, said.
