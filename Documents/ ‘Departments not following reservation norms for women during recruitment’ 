The Legislature Committee on Women and Child Welfare has said that many departments were not following the reservation norms fixed for recruitment of women and has decided to take up the issue with the government.Chairman of the committee and the former Minister Malikayya Guttedar, who chaired a review meeting here on Thursday, told presspersons that Karnataka was the second State after West Bengal to provide 33 per cent reservation to women in recruitments to government departments.(Earlier the reservation percentage was 30 and it was recently increased to 33).He said that many departments were providing 33 per cent reservation to women at the time of recruitment.The committee, while reviewing the functioning of anganwadis, felt that each anganwadi should have a pure drinking water facility and reverse osmosis plants.Mr. Guttedar said that he would request all MLAs to provide funds from the MLA local area funds and the HKRDB allocations for installing the RO plants in the Anganwadis.Mr. Guttedar said that committee also noted the large number of vacancies in the Women and Child Welfare Department and would urge the government to fill up these vacancies.Mr. Guttedar said that the experiment of supplying the nutritious food in the form of powder to anganwadis to be cooked and served to children in Kalaburagi district had been very successful and helped in reducing pilferage and its illegal sale in the open market. Now the committee proposes to recommend to the state government to extend the experiment in other districts.
