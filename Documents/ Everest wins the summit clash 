The fifteen-day cricket carnival at Mulapadu came to an end as Ajay Kumar-led Everest Cricket Club lifted the coveted Krishna District Cricket Association’s (KDCA) Power League Trophy for ‘A’ league, defeating the VVKRM by 24 runs in the final on Thursday.The league, played for the first time in both the grounds at the lush green playfield owned by KDCA, witnessed several brilliant team and individual performances and a good number of present and former Ranji players added the all-important edge to the competition.Former Ranji skipper V. Vijayasaradhy from Chennai, former Andhra junior player V. Girish, who won the best bowler award, present Ranji players V. Lenin, K. Harish and T.K. Ganesh made Everest look like a star-studded team and together they churned out several match winning performances to lift the trophy.Says Girish, who had come all the way from Ghana to play the tournament: “Mulapadu stadium is one of the best playfields in the ACA region. It appears good for batting and players with patience can come out with flying colours”.He also felt the league should be made a two-day affair to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the players. VVKRM, the other finalist also had Ranji players such as Jyothi Sai Krishna, Swaroop Kumar and A.V. Shasikanth in its arsenal.Andhra Cricket Association joint secretary Ch. Arun Kumar handed over the trophy to Everest owners K. Ravi Sankar and Ramineni Ramu. The team was sponsored by MKV Ventures with Mahesh Krishna as its director.
