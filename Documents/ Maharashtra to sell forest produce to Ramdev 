Forest produce such as honey and herbs from Maharashtra will now be funnelled into yoga guru and businessperson Baba Ramdev’s bottles and jars to be sold under the Patanjali brand name. The State government on Tuesday held meetings with Ramdev and said it will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with his Patanjali Trust for the sale and marketing of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) from Maharashtra.State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who met Ramdev in Mumbai to finalise the scheme, told The Hindu: “At present, raw material required for various Ayurvedic products of Patanjali is bought from various sources. He (Ramdev) was keen on definite sources of products like honey, herbs, etc. Once the deal is finalised, it will be a big boost to tribals sourcing forest products.”The Patanjali Trust will have to assure purchase of a certain quantity the product from the State so as not to jeopardise the interests of producers. The scheme is aimed at benefiting tribals in the forest and buffer zones in the State, said officials. The trust will send the list of required products to the State and specify the price it can pay. These rates will be analysed for financial viability.
