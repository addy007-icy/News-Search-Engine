Automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra is confident of releasing 10 vehicles in the market this fiscal by launching two more before March 31. “We are sure of keeping our market shares across different segments too with a slight variation,” said its senior vice-resident-sales, Veejay Ram Nakra.The two launches will be that of the KUV 100 with a petrol engine option and the other will be a variant of the Quanto. About the ban on diesel vehicles with over 2,000 cc engine capacity, he said across the industry, manufacturers were waiting for Supreme Court directions. “We have chalked out our strategy to address the related issues and will unveil it once the Court order comes,” he explained, adding that the company’s share of the market for such vehicles ranged between three and 3.5 per cent.Earlier, Mr. Nakra and General Manager-Sales (South), Rajesh Bhaseen launched the latest from the M & M stable - the Imperio designed as a premium pick up that comes with two and four-door cabin options.
