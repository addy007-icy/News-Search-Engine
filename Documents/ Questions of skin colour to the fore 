The Black tenant, who shames a racially overly inquisitive landlady eager to know the exact tone of his skin with a graphic description of the shades of black in each part of his body in Wole Soyinka’s celebrated poem, ‘Telephone Conversation’ may have bequeathed his iconoclastic tenets to Tatiana de Stempel.The London-based artist grappled with the issue of skin colour and the perpetual social discrimination it entails. A tripartite show, the outcome of her inquiry into the social manifestations of colour consciousness, obsession rather, will get under way at Backyard Civilisation gallery on Mattancherry’s time-warped Bazar Road on January 15.Writer and columnist Manjo Nair is curating the exhibition, which will travel to London from Kochi with an additional video on the workshops slated to take place here. Artist Binoy Varghese’s paintings of dark-skinned migrant workers portrayed against fantastic background, to bring about a contrast, sparked a discussion on issues of skin colour between Tatiana and Manoj resulting in the project.The artist, who was shocked to see the ‘Black and White Minstrel Show’ in her childhood in which white people performed, cartoon-like, in blackface, she was quick to strike up random conversations with people on the road on the question of skin colour and filmed it. It explores topics like race, class, education, jobs, ethnicity, identity and pay besides the part the colour of their skin has played in determining opportunities and choices.The second part comprises photographs of people from India and the U.K., their tongues sticking out. “No matter their skin colour, the tongues are all pink. Everyone has the same tongue,” she told The Hindu in a conversation. The last part, a series of paintings, covers the obsession of people with different conditions with hair, fairness creams and botox surgery.“Given the popularity of fairness creams in India and the north-south divide over skin tone, Kochi is the right place to hold the exhibition,” she maintains.As part of the show, an Aussie artist will conduct a portrait painting workshop for children at the gallery on January 16. Another one on the day after will focus on the widespread use of fairness creams in India. “Both these will be video-graphed and become part of the show when it travels to London,” says Manoj.'Shadism internalised'“Shadism has been internalised in countries like the U.S., India, Pakistan and the Caribbean countries where there is a thriving market for fairness creams because even within the darker-skinned community, there is a prejudice from the past,” according to Tatiana.The exhibition will be on till January 24.
