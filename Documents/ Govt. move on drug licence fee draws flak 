Condemning the Central government’s move to revise the drug licence fee, renewal fee and others, the Krishna District Chemists and Druggists’ Association on Wednesday appealed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to scrap the move, citing financial implications on wholesale and retail traders.The Central government had issued a notification announcing revision of drug licence fee and others and also sought objections from people and the chemist associations.The government plans to revise the fresh licence fee from the existing Rs.3,000 to Rs.30,000 and similarly renewal of licences is also being increased to Rs.30,000. The same applies to change of address. “This is abnormal hike and given the raising operational costs and cut- throat competition, it will adversely affect the traders, especially the small-time retailers,” said association general secretary P.S. Patnaik.Last dateAs per the notification, the last date to submit suggestions and raise objections over the proposed revision of licence fee is February 2, 2016. There are close to 40,000 wholesale and retail drug outlets in the State, of these nearly 3500 are operated in Krishna district.“If the government insists on revising the fee abnormally, many outlets, which are presently operating in several remote areas and even those operating round the clock in urban areas, will be forced to shut, due to financial implications” said Mr. Patnaik.Draft notificationHe claimed that in the draft notification, the government proposed to enhance every type of licence fee by five to 10 times, including that of change of premises and renewal of licence, which would burden the traders financially.For instance, earlier, if a pharmacist or a competent person changed, the challan fee was Rs.500 but now it was being increased to Rs.5000, he said.Stir threat“It is not just the financial implications on traders but also the livelihood of many employees working in the outlets. The government has to reconsider its plans, failing which, we will be forced to go on strike,” said Mr. Patnaik.Chemists and druggists in Krishna have urged the Centre to scrapthe proposal
