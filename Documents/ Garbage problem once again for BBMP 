Once again, the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is faced with resistance from communities living around the Kannahalli and Seegehalli waste processing units. They have dug a five-metre deep trench outside the Kannahalli unit to prevent garbage laden vehicles from entering the plant.As a result, the BBMP did not send any waste to the two units on Monday. Residents of Tavarekere, Chennenahalli, Kadabagere, Machohalli, Kachohalli, Kannahalli, Seegehalli and surrounding villages have been demanding closure of both units. On Monday, they blocked the busy Magadi Road for a while and later staged a snap protest in front of the two units.Manjunath, Kannahalli resident, said that the BBMP had made several false assurances. “We are suffering due to the stench and flies. This is due to the unscientific processing of waste. The problems are acute as the plant is in the middle of a residential area,” he said.He claimed that the police had advised them not to continue with their protest since the model code of conduct is in force. “We will intensify our struggle against these units after February 16 when the code of conduct will end,” he added.Meanwhile, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (solid waste management) Subodh Yadav said that waste is being processed scientifically at both units. “We will take a call on sending waste to the two units after assessing the ground report. Currently, we have diverted the waste to other units,” he said.
