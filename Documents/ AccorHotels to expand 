AccorHotels is expanding its presence in India by adding 11 hotels by the end of this year as rooms occupancy rates increase fuelled by a rise in domestic travel, a senior company official said.“Our intent is to grow at the speed with which we have been growing over the past decade. We launched our first hotel brand Novotel in India ten years ago in Hyderabad. During these years, we have added 4-5 properties every year and by the end of this year, we will have about 46 hotels.No international brand has done such rapid expansion. We wish to grow further as we have a long term commitment for the Indian market,” Jean-Michel Casse, Senior Vice President, AccorHotels India told The Hindu.The 5.4-billion-euro group has 35 hotels across seven brands in India. However, the group expects its economy brand Ibis and mid-scale brand Novotel to drive its business in the near term. The group is setting up Ibis hotels in India through a separate join venture InterGlobe Hotels. They have so far set up 12 hotels across the country under the Ibis brand with the latest one being the Chennai City Centre Hotel. While five more properties are to come up before this March, the joint venture has planned to have 19 hotels under Ibis brand by next year.Mr.Casse said its core brand in India was Ibis and he didn’t see much competition for economy brand. “Our value-for-money positioning and consistence in quality of services help us to stay ahead of others in this segment.”It has also chalked out strong expansion plans for its Novetel brand. “The Hyderabad property has given us an amazing visibility and we have been able to develop a pipeline of new properties under this brand,” he said.
