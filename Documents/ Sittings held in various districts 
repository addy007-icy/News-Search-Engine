Implementation of Plan projects by local self-governments is much below the expected level, Fifth State Finance Commission chairman B.A. Prakash has said. Mr. Prakash told reporters here on Friday that the slackness in implementation should be attributed to the surfeit of Plan projects. The commission reached this conclusion after conducting sittings in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode districts to review the progress in Plan project implementation. The second report of the commission to be submitted to the government soon would recommend amendments to the relevant rules. The first report regarding fund allocation has been submitted to the Governor. Elected members tend to share projects among themselves and that was one of the main reasons for the increase in number of projects. On taking up a large number of projects, securing clearances in time is a tough task. Local governments do not have sufficient staff or facilities, he said. Bunching of projects is another issue. A majority of the projects are being executed in March and 50 per cent of them are not completed on time. Grama sabhas have not been helpful in preparing projects, he said.
