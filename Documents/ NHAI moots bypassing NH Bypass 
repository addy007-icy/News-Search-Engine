Faced with acute traffic snarls and mounting accidents on Edappally-Aroor NH 47 Bypass, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has mooted yet another eastward bypass connecting Angamaly and Kundanoor.The 36-km-long, six-lane corridor would considerably decongest the existing bypass which is used by intra-city, inter-district and inter-State vehicles, including container and national-permit lorries, NHAI sources said. Back in September, the authorityâ€™s chairman Raghav Chandra had during his visit to inspect NHAI roads in Kochi, suggested a new bypass since the existing four-lane bypass corridor carries as many vehicles as an eight-lane highway.He further said that the State government could propose a new alignment for this, so that the city can expand eastward to a wider area. He also added that the government must expedite land acquisition in a systematic and time-bound manner to widen NH 47 that passes through Kerala into a four-lane road.Bypass wideningThe NHAI had simultaneously mooted widening of the Edappally-Aroor Bypass into a six or eight lane corridor by hewing out space from the side medians and service roads.This project too is a non-starter, with the result that vacant space on service roads is used for parking all type of vehicles, including goods carriers.Vast many shops and commercial establishments from MG Road and other areas are shifting to the Bypass, calling for steps to streamline traffic flow. Traffic movement is currently smooth only along areas between Vyttila and Aroor which have six-lane width.But the authority has been unable to make headway in the widening process.
