The Women and Child Development Corporation has chalked out programmes with more stress on eradicating the social evil system of Devadasis, spread over in 14 districts of the State, and bring them (Devadasis) to the mainstream by rehabilitating them.“Our main motto is, through our programmes, including skill development and income generating activities, to ensure that Devadasis put an end to their ‘profession’, and also ensure that they gave their children good education instead of pushing them into the same ‘profession’,” Vasanti Shivappa, corporation chairperson, told presspersons here on Monday. She said that she was undertaking a tour of the 14 districts where women are practising the Devadasis system, starting from Ballari, which had the highest number of Devadasis at 9,000, and urging the officials concerned to chalk out a plan of action in this regard.Apart from providing them houses/sites, the government is encouraging them by way of imparting proper training to become self-employed/take up income-generating activities, including dairy, crafts or become security guards and physiotherapists.The government has approved allotment of 11,800 houses to Devadasis and the Deputy Commissioners were being requested to allot suitable land for providing shelter to them, she said.“The department has come out with a facility in Belagavi to train women to become security guards. The training includes handling fire arms. Women are being given help in improving their skills in various vocations. We have launched campaigns to create awareness among poor women about our programmes to drive home the point that they could become self-reliant,” she said.Earlier, she reviewed the progress of various schemes for women, including Udyogini, allotment of sites/houses and payment of pension.Vijay Prakash, Managing Director, Sameer Shukla, Deputy Commissioner, S.S. Nakul, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer, B.S. Kaladgi, Deputy Director Women and Child Development, were, among others, present.
