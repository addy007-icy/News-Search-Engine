Mounting accidents involving houseboats, a prime revenue-garner for Kerala Tourism, has forced the government to keep tabs on them using the latest technology and fleet management solution.In 2015, three houseboats were damaged in fire at Meenapally, near Kainakari, and at Finishing Point at Punnamada Lake. In another incident, a houseboat sank at the lake. Criminal cases involving the crew and harassment of tourists are a major concern for the tourism sector.The tracking system is based on the series of recommendations made by a nine-member committee, headed by former Tourism Secretary Suman Billa. The 2013 order given by the government to the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) for Rs.1.58 crore for installing the tracking system had been cancelled without assigning reasons. Keltron has been roped in for the project now.
