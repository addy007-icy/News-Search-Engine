abarimala pilgrims climbing down the hillock after Makaravilakku darshan will be dispersed in a phased manner and in one direction to avoid possibility of stampede this season.A hold & release crowd-control method would be tried at the hill shrine for the first time as part of a Crisis Management Plan (CMP) prepared by the Institute of Land and Disaster Management. It is estimated that thousands of pilgrims will reach the temple complex during the festival season and the maximum turnout is expected on January 15, the Makaravilakku day.Several areas which are vulnerable to stampede have been identified by experts.The Sannidhanam and its adjoining areas have been divided into 10 zones for streamlining the crisis-response operation. The zones include Sopanam and Kodimaram, areas in front of the Pathinettampadi left side, right side, Vadakke Nada, Padinjare Nada, Nadappanthal, Malikappuram, in front of Media Building, Pandithavalam, and Kopra drying yard. Instead of the usual practice of pilgrims moving downwards randomly in all directions after Makaravilakku, those staying at Nadappanthal and adjacent resting places will be released first.They will be followed by pilgrims from the Makarajyothi viewing sites in and around the Kopra drying area, then from the Malikappuram premises, says Faisal T. Illiyas, project in-charge, Sabarimala Crisis Management Plan. To streamline the phased crowd release, the CMP recommends restricting “civil darshan” through Vadakke Nada from 6.30 p.m. on the day.Pilgrims will be asked to wait patiently for their turn to go down the hillock.The crowd would be released in one direction at regular intervals to prevent their rapid movements and resultant crowd surge, he explains.The authorities have prepared disaster-specific responses covering possible crisis situations such as flash floods at the Pampa, human-animal conflict, falling of trees, building collapse, and fire emergency. Modalities for medical transportation from the Sannidanam and mass casualty management mechanism too have been prepared.Several areas in the hill shrine have been identified as vulnerable to stampede by experts
