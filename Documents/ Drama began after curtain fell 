There was more drama off stage than on it, as the drama competition for higher secondary ended around 4 a.m. on Saturday. As the results were declared, all the 21 teams except one were awarded ‘A’ grades. The students of Cotton Hill Girls Higher Secondary School in Thiruvananthapuram who were awarded the sole ‘B’ grade soon began a protest on the stage.The students had performed the drama ‘Izha anakkangal’ directed by Ambootty. They alleged that the judges had unfairly given them the ‘B’ grade despite their performance being appreciated by the audience. Soon after the results were announced, the organisers and security staff switched off the lights and left the stage, but the students continued to sit there in protest. They continued the protest till 11 a.m., when the blood pressure of some of the students dropped, and they had to be shifted to the hospital.“From the audience reaction, it was clear that this was one among the best dramas staged yesterday. Awarding ‘B’ grade to just this one play raises questions on the credibility of the judging,” said Mr. Ambootty.Several of the theatre aficionados in the audience that The Hindu talked to said the drama deserved a better treatment from the judges. The Director of Public Instructions held talks with the students and promised to take necessary action after checking the videos of the competition.
