CPI (M) along with all other political parties, including Telugu Desam, will be convening an all-part meeting on January 19 (Tuesday) at Hanumantharaya granthalayam to save the interests of Krishna and Guntur Districts in the capital formation, according to CPI(M) CRDA region convener Ch. Babu Rao.An invitation was also sent to the ruling TDP as many leaders of the party felt that they were kept in dark regarding master plan.“Though Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had asked his party cadre not to speak about the capital formation issues several leaders are having doubts about their districts,” he added.A similar meeting would be held at Guntur on January 20 and a call be given to all the villagers in the capital region area to send their objections on the master plan of CDRA.“The last date for sending objections is January 25. We will ensure that every villager in the two districts sends his or her objections on the ill-conceived master plan of the CDRA,” he added.
