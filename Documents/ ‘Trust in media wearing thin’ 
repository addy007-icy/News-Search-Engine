Media expert Sashi Kumar has said that public trust in news media is wearing thin owing to the mediaâ€™s failure to truthfully reflect the social reality.Inaugurating a session on the media held as part of the fourth International Congress on Kerala Studies organised by the AKG Centre for Research and Studies here on Sunday, Mr. Sashi Kumar said the law of diminishing returns has already begun to operate in the media. The competitive environment in the media is such that nobody wishes to miss the story that others are putting out, he said.
