The idea of protecting the biodiversity-rich Kattampally wetland area spread over six panchayats and parts of the Kannur Corporation as a community reserve is an answer to the practical difficulties involved in declaring some migratory bird sites in the area as a protected sanctuary. The proposed community reserve at Kattampally is an initiative launched by the Forest Department as an alternative to the earlier proposal for declaring Munderikkadavu that formed part of the Kattampally wetland area as a bird sanctuary. The entire wetland area is known for its brackish water rice and prawn cultivation system (‘kaipad’ farming in local parlance).A one-day workshop on the new proposal was held here on January 2 to secure the support of local environmental activists, farmers, land owners in the area and local panchayats for the new initiative.“The proposal for community reserve has been mooted in the wake of the demand from environmental activists and bird watchers that Munderikkadavu be declared as a bird sanctuary,” said A.P. Abdullakutty, MLA. The proposal followed a realisation that the entire wetland had to be protected with the involvement of local people and local bodies, he added.Much of the Kattampally wetland area located in Chirakkal, Narath, Kolachery, Chelora, Mundery and Kuttyattoor panchayats and Puzhathi and Elayavur areas of the Kannur Corporation is owned by farmers.“The entire area is biodiversity-rich and it is kaipad farming system that supports the bird habitat there,” said Dineshan Cheruvat, Joint Director of Fisheries (North Zone). “It is also not practical to declare one location as bird habitat, without measures to conserve the entire wetland area,” he added.According to Forest officials, the plan is to constitute a committee with representatives of the panchayats and of the Forest Department as a mechanism to ensure the conservation of the area.“The community reserve proposal means no government takeover of land,” said Khaleel Chovva, environmental activist. “The wetland is rich in migratory birds and has all the characteristics of being declared as a Ramsar site,” he added.
