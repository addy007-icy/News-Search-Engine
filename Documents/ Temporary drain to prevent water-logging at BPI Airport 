The Odisha government will soon construct a temporary drain to stop water-logging that has caused fast growth of vegetation in Biju Patnaik International Airport.Birds flocking around vegetation have been posing constant threat to flight movement in the airport.Recently, at a high-level meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary, BPI airport authority informed that the standing water had caused enormous growth of vegetation and insisted immediate action.The authority suggested that since permanent drainage arrangement would take long time, an earthen temporary channel should be developed immediately to solve water-logging problem adjacent to the airport boundary.It was also decided that a temporary surface drain be excavated as an interim measure. The drain would be constructed keeping minimum distance from the boundary wall. In the past, hyenaa, dogs and other animals have been captured from the runway of the airport. Vegetation was widely perceived to be the reason behind presence of animals and birds in the vicinity.
