Every year, thousands of birds die of thirst in the scorching summer. In cities, birds find it difficult to find a rich source of water. Moreover, in cities, buildings made of brick and cement get really hot and can hardly be a home for birds. The smoke and gases let out by the vehicles and factories add to the air pollution and raises atmospheric temperature.Many birds are on the brink of extinction. We need to take measures to save these birds.V.R. Jayasri, V, Malar Nursery and Primary School, Chennai
