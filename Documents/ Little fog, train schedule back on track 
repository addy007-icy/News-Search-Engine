: Even as foggy conditions continue to hamper rail movement in north India, services of many trains running from Delhi have been restored even while these were cancelled earlier keeping poor visibility in mind.According to officials of the Northern Railway, the rather fog-free January in Delhi has belied their expectation of dense fog. It had reduced or stopped the frequency of nearly 160 trains, including some Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duranto trains.“This was done to overcome the problems faced in management of train operations during foggy season, which was based on our previous year’s experience,” said a northern railway spokesperson.However, Railways has reviewed the current foggy conditions and assuming less intensity of fog, it has decided to fully restore the service of 30 pairs of Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Janshatabdi, Duranto (60 trains) and partially restore (increase in frequency) 48 pairs (96 Trains) of other popular trains.
