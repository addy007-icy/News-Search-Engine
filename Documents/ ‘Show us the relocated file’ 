The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday demanded that the Aam Aadmi Party government convene an all-party meeting of Sikh leaders to clear the air about the 1984 anti-Sikh riot file that reportedly went missing from the Delhi Secretariat. The file in question pertains to the constitution of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the riots.Rubbishing the claims of the Delhi government that the file has been traced, BJP national secretary R. P. Singh said: “All claims by the government are mere eyewash and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should immediately call a meeting of senior Sikh leaders of all political parties to present the file in front of us. We have all the reason to suspect that the Kejriwal government is trying to mislead the Sikh community about the status of the file.”Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said the missing file was a reflection of the Kejriwal government’s “casual attitude” towards a highly sensitive issue.“The file has been missing for the past 10 months, but the AAP government did not bother to locate it,” Mr. Gupta added.The BJP MLA from Rohini also criticised the Delhi government for its “constant state of confusion”.“The Deputy Chief Minister expressed his ignorance; the Home Minister called it a rumour; the Deputy Secretary of the Home Department issued a circular to lookout for the file in all Departments and the AAP said the file is in possession of the government! Is it some kind of a joke or game?” he asked.
