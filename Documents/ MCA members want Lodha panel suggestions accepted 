The Mumbai Cricket Association’s (MCA’s) Annual General Meeting on January 22 is likely to be a stormy affair with two former managing committee members proposing a resolution to be passed to support the administrative overhaul of Indian cricket through the Supreme Court-appointed Justice RM Lodha panel.Shripad Halbe, representing the Oriental Cricket Club has submitted a proposal in favour of welcoming the Lodha panel recommendations and the MCA implementing all the recommendations pertaining to state associations. The resolution was submitted to MCA joint secretaries on January 14. It is seconded by Ravi Mandrekar, who represents Gaud Saraswat Cricket Club.“Resolved that this General Body of Mumbai Cricket Association welcomes all the recommendations of the Lodha Committee appointed by the Hon. Supreme Court of India to improve the functioning of the BCCI and its State Associations,” states the three-page resolution, which also includes an explanatory statement.“Further resolved that this General Body directs the Managing Committee of the Mumbai Cricket Association to implement forthwith all the suggestions/ recommendations of the Lodha Committee pertaining to the State Associations.”The Hindu understands that the MCA managing committee has forwarded the Lodha panel report to its six-member Legal Committee, including lawyers Nilesh Khandray, Shekhar Shetty, Deepak Thackeray, Sanjeev Gorwadkar, Vinit Naik and Sandeep Dolas.According to MCA rules, the resolution will be tabled in the AGM towards the end of the meeting. It remains to be seen if any of the 329 members support the resolution. After the Lodha Committee’s recommendations were made public on January 4, the MCA managing committee decided to seek more clarity from the BCCI.“We are happy with the recommendations. There are certain areas we have to discuss with the BCCI. We want more clarity,” MCA president Sharad Pawar had said on Wednesday. “…there are practical difficulties which we will discuss with the Board.”
