Whether it is innovative ways to generate renewable energy or eco-friendly farming methods, saving the Earth and human life seemed to be the recurring theme in the models showcased at the Southern India Science Fair (SISF), which started on Tuesday.On display are nearly 300 science and mathematics models by over 600 students and teachers of the southern States. Each model has stood the rigours of previous competitions at the zonal level. As one walks along the aisles set up behind the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM), it becomes obvious that the models reflect the issues that afflict their districts.Take for instance, the low-cost farming techniques showcased by Shravani P., a Standard X student of Chinmaya Vidyalaya in Kolar district where a persistent drought has turned the lives of many farmers upside down. Displaying multiple systems, including plants in artificial foam floating on water and a ‘bubblephonics’ system to induce air bubbles into the water, she says productivity can be doubled and water consumption reduced. “Instead of 25kg of tomatoes in a small patch, you can produce 50kg,” she says.Many projects take their inspiration from recurring tragedies. Class IX student, K. Sivasankari from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu envisions a machine that rescues children stuck in borewells. Other projects include tsunami and fire warning systems.
