Amidst stiff resistance from the owners, City Municipal Council (CMC) authorities demolished illegal petty shops near Pillakeranhalli village here on Friday. There was a verbal clash between the owners and the authorities.The owners gathered outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office and staged a dharna demanding action against the CMC authorities for removing the shops without issuing any notice to them.They also said that they had lost their houses and land during the widening of national highway 13 and were dependent on these shops and the CMC’s move has put them in deep trouble.They also alleged that the CMC authorities behaved rudely with the owners and their family and wanted action against them. They also submitted a memorandum in this regard to Additional Deputy Commissioner Ravindra.Responding to the memorandum, Mr Ravindra informed that the sites and houses can be provided to eligible persons who lost houses and land during road widening if they submit a list of people by holding meeting at panchayats.
