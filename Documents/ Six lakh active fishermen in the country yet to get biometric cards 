Stating that about six lakh active fishermen in the country are yet to be issued with bio-metric cards Ashok Kumar Angurana, Secretary, Union Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, has said that issuing the cards is crucial to pass on to them the benefits of space technology relating to fishing.Delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of a two-day workshop on ‘Adoption of space technology for fisheries’ here on Monday he said that out of an estimated 1.5 crore fishermen in the country 20 lakh were active. States have issued bio-metric cards to about seven lakh. He urged States to issue the cards to the remaining before June, 2016. The distribution of cards had begun in 2009.When fishermen were issued with the cards their entire data would be with the government. Using them the government could pass on information relating to weather forecast, potential fishing zones in the area, and government schemes relating to them on their cellphones. This would reduce operational cost of fishing boats and ensure their safety.Biometric cards established identity of fishermen. It helped during security check at sea and resolving issues relating to crossing fishing zones of States and countries.Creation of data base of 20-lakh odd fishermen becomes critical to a mission envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a national meet on September 7 last, followed up with an inter-ministerial meet held on October 30 to roll out technology-based solutions to fishermen.Mr. Angurana said that States would have to modernise and upgrade technologies in 167 monitoring control surveillance centres for tracking of fishing vessels in sea using the RealCraft software developed by National Informatics Centre. The upgrading should include posting enough staff to manage them.
