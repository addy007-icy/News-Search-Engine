Kung Fu Panda 3, the third instalment in the popular animated movie series is scheduled to release on January 29.The series features an unusual hero — a fat panda, Po, who against all odds is chosen as the Dragon Warrior, the kung fu master.Po, while fighting external evils that threaten his community also faces inner conflicts about his identity and abilities, and is guided by his teacher, Master Shifu, on his path to finding inner peace. In representing a fat, sloth-like animal as a kung fu expert, this series breaks away from typical movies which feature a strong, fit and confident character as the hero, conveying the idea that appearances and power need not be limitations on what one can achieve. Kung Fu Panda movies are entertaining as comedies and also discuss the profound truths of life, which makes them appealing to kids and adults alike.With the upcoming release of the much awaited part three, here is a look back at other unusual and unexpected heroes in recent animated movies.Despicable Me 1 & 2 and MinionsYear released: 2010, 2013 and 2015Heroes: Gru and MinionsDespicable Me is a series which revolves around unusually small, yellow creatures who call themselves minions.They serve different evil masters in the three movies, but ultimately end up doing more good than evil.
