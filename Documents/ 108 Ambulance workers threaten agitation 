The district unit of Karnataka Rajya Arogya Kavacha (108) Naukarara Sangha has threatened to bring the emergency ambulance services to a halt from January 24 if their demand for implementation of the High Court order on wage hike was not implemented by January 23.The Sangha members led by their president Laxman Kamati submitted a memorandum to the Additional Deputy Commissioner Suresh Itnal on Monday, declaring their decision to launch the indefinite agitation.Mr. Kamati said the High Court had passed orders and the Labour Commissioner too had also directed the GVK EMRI (Emergency Management Service Institute) to increase the wages and also pay over-time wages for additional hours of work to the workers under the 108 Ambulance services about two years ago. But, the GVK EMRI organisation, operating in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode, was not implementing these directions.The Sangha had been pleading with the organisation and the government for increasing the wages for the last two years. Since there was no positive response, the Sangha was left with no choice but to launch an agitation to make the government listen to its long pending grievances.
