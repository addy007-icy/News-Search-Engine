Describing the January 3 violence at Kaliachak in West Bengal’s Malda district as "not a small incident" Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said here on Thursday that the truth behind the incident should come out.Addressing a party rally at Ashoknagar in North 24 Parganas district, Mr Singh assured the gathering that those behind the incident will be behind bars."Malda incident is not a small Incident, and I want to tell this State government and the Chief Minister that those who are behind this incident, they will have to be unmasked. Just a few arrests will not suffice," the Home Minister said.He raised questions as to why was the State government not aware of such large gathering and why senior officers of the police were not present on the spot.The Home Minister also refuted the claims that the incident was a scuffle between Border Security Force (BSF) and locals."It was not an issue between BSF and locals but a BSF official's vehicle was attacked.... If the BSF which guards our borders is attacked publicly and those who indulge in the attack roam freely, how can this be allowed?" the Home Minister asked.Pointing out that illegal activities along the India-Bangladesh border, such as fake Indian currency notes and cattle smuggling, have come down, the Home Minister said it was the result of good diplomacy.Reacting to Mr Singh’s remark, Trinamool Congress national spokesperson Derek O' Brien said it reflected a tactic of the BJP in the election- bound State."The country knows this is a well known tactic BJP uses when elections are at hand. And all this coming from a central government which is running the nation using 'agencies' to pursue its own cynical agenda," the party spokesperson said, adding that he was using a political meeting to threaten the State.
