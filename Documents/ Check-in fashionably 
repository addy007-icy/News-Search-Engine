A train goes choo-choo along the sleeve of a top while a boat sails on a check sea along the hemline of a tunic. Motor cars and scooters too ply along the garments, some of which have white detailing to mark the road. Sreejith Jeevan’s Rouka’s new collection ‘Checked-In’ is playful nod to the traveller. The collection is small with 12 styles – shirts, tops, tunics, pants and the like – for women and men. It has all the elements of Rouka – from the detailing to the fabric. Checked-In is a bow to Madras Checks, which was extremely popularly at one time in Europe. Sreejith sees the collection as a souvenir from Kochi for the traveller who visits the city; he extends the metaphor to the design as well. The reversible garments, for instance, is all about travelling light and economical. The collection, constructed in South cottons, in shades of grey and black (think roads), has its share of quirk. “The motifs are about the modes of transport during the journey.” The blue and green of the checks, possibly the two colours we could associate with Kerala, representative of the sea and our flora respectively. The ROUKA store is at Valanjamabalam and retails from Pepper House, Fort Kochi.
