Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has accused the Kerala Lok Ayukta of bias in its handling of cases, delaying decisions in cases in which those in power are the accused and showing undue haste in cases against those who are not in the good books of those in power.In a statement here on Friday, Mr. Achuthanandan said the Lok Ayukta, formed to ensure that the government machinery functions flawlessly and untainted by corruption, is singing hosannas to the corrupt deeds of those in power. Although the Lok Ayukta had received investigation reports against Ministers eight months ago, it had not cared to issue notices to the accused.There were also complaints that the Lok Ayukta is trying to defer consideration of these cases indefinitely, he said.The Opposition Leader said such actions of the Lok Ayukta would hurt the credibility of judiciary. The authorities concerned should examine this and take corrective action, Mr. Achuthanandan said.
