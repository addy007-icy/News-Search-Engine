Terrorism experts believe Europe faces a “new normal” of more threats and disruption to major events amid heightened security fears in the months ahead.Following the attacks in Paris, analysts in the U.K. and Europe say security services are coming to terms with the fact that the Islamic State appears to have the intention and capability to hit European targets in professionally planned and executed attacks.Munich was partially evacuated following a terror threat on New Year’s Eve, while events in other European cities were either cancelled or scaled down because of security concerns.Margaret Gilmore, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said more disruption was likely in the months ahead.“For the last 15 years there have been terrorist organisations who have wanted to carry out attacks in crowded places so in that sense this is nothing new. And since the attack in 2008 in Mumbai we have been aware of the possibility of the marauding multi-site gun attacks.“But what is new now is that Isis has proved they are capable, after Paris, of carrying out terrible attacks beyond its traditional arena of the Middle East.” She said that the attack on the French capital had underlined how quickly the group had grown.Prof. Rik Coolsaet, a terrorism expert from Ghent University in Belgium, said that although there was nothing new in terrorist groups wanting to attack high-profile public gatherings such as New Year’s Eve, IS’s appeal meant Europe was entering a new era.He said the extremist group had become the “object of all kinds of fantasies for all kind of individuals, from thrill-seekers to the mentally unstable”, who wanted to be part of the group, and that made the security services’ job much harder.“In the months ahead we are going to be facing a new normal,” said Mr. Coolsaet. He also warned there was a danger of people conflating Europe’s refugee crisis with the growing terror threat. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016
