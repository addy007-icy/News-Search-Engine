Police had a tough time controlling the crowd, even as his frenzied fans started mobbing their favourite star.Later, speaking to the media, Mr. Balakrishna conveyed festive greetings to people in his own inimitable style and remarked that his latest movie would appeal to all sections of audience. He even delivered a dialogue snippet from the movie eliciting hoots and cackles from the crowd.Disappointed fanscry foulStaff Reporter writes from Srikakulam: People are being forced to buy tickets in black-market in majority of theatres of Srikakulam district, thanks to lack of supervision over the managements which had reportedly blocked majority of the tickets.It is alleged that each balcony ticket was sold between Rs. 250 and Rs. 400 for movies like Nannaku Premato and Dictator . Black marketing is likely on Sankranti day, too, with the release of Soggade Chinni Nayana on Friday.Meanwhile, fans of NTR and Balakrishna have requested police and Revenue officials to take stern action against theatre managements that failed to sell tickets through counters. The managements argued that tickets had been booked online, and that they could not be blamed for it.
