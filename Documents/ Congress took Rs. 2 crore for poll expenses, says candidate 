K. Venkatramana Reddy, the Congress MLC candidate for the local bodies’ election from the district who withdrew from the contest on the last day , demanded that the Congress leaders return the Rs.2 crore which he deposited with them towards election expenditure. Coming down heavily on senior Congress leaders at a press conference here on Saturday, the former Zilla Parishad chairman, said that he withdrew from the fray as there was a change in the attitude of party leaders following indications of his victory became clear. That apart, the Congress leaders started demanding more money to be spent constituency-wise for election, he said. “I deposited Rs. 2 crore for the ticket with the party committee comprising nine constituency in-charges. Later, they signalled me to mobilise another Rs. 2 crore and I was prepared. However, they wanted to spend the money themselves instead of allowing me to distribute it. The money was already distributed at the rate of Rs.30,000 to each MPTC member and municipal councillor in Kamareddi constituency,” he said. “Now I am asking the party leaders to return my money. I had already complained to the AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi on December 29 and will bring it to the notice of Chief Electoral Officer by personally meeting him,” he said. Mr. Reddy said that he had no idea of contesting the election as he had no money.He, however, said that he managed to pool the money and deposit with the Congress leaders with the assistance extended by his friends and relatives. Refuting the allegation that he had been offered Rs.3 crore and a plum post in the Government in lieu of his withdrawal, he said: “I deposited Rs. 2 crore and was ready to deposit another Rs.2 crore.
