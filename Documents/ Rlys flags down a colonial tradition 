The Indian Railways will confine to history a colonial tradition of physically carrying its collection of cash, cash acknowledgement, and ticket earnings from all stations and shift to cash transfer via Net banking.For, South Western Railway has signed an MoU with the State Bank of India (SBI) for “doorstep banking,” under which the bank’s agents will collect the earnings of the day from each of the stations and credit it to the Railway account online in 24 hoursThe move marks turning the page as the hoary practice of depositing the day’s collection in a leather bag, sealing it and dumping it in a giant steel trunk, and loading it to the guard’s compartment of the designated “cash train”, transporting it to the head office where an official with a master key would open it in the presence of higher officials, will be abandoned. (Details as to which train would be a “cash train’’ would be kept highly confidential.)Though major stations with banking facilities have switched to depositing the amount at the nearest branch, the practice is in vogue in remote stations without banking facilities. But the acknowledgement for cash deposit in banks from all stations continues to be transported through cash chest.Rajkumar Lal, Divisional Railway Manager of Mysuru division of South Western Railways, said the new system would come into vogue in a few days, and as per the MoU, SBI’s agents would collect cash, cheques and vouchers at the station itself and give acknowledgement on the spot.He said the archaic system of transporting hard currency and other negotiable instruments, such as like DD (demand draft), cash voucher, cheques etc. by passenger trains was not only fraught with risk but also time consuming.The Railways in Karnataka would be able to save at least Rs. 70 lakh per annum on switching to the new system, besides ensuring safety, according to a senior official.The earnings from 84 stations in the Mysuru division alone were reckoned to be around Rs. 3 crore per day.Besides Mysuru, Hubballi and Bengaluru divisions have also signed the MoU and would revert to the new system of depositing cash, Mr. Lal said.
