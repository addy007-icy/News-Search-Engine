Kooresa, Ramanuja’s foremost and ideal disciple, has served the preceptor in all his endeavours with utmost commitment. Known for the renunciation of his wealth, his humility and his scholarship, he is also a classic example of exceptional magnanimity, said Sri T. A. Srinidhi Swamy in a discourse.At a time when rivalries between Saiva and Vaishnava faiths raged high, there is threat to Ramanuja’s life and his principles in Srirangam. The Chozha king, a staunch Saivite, thinks that by subduing Ramanuja, Vaishnavism could be squashed in his kingdom. So he summons Ramanuja to the royal court. But Kooresa and Periya Nambi, sensing the danger to Ramanuja, arrange for his escape from Srirangam and prepare themselves to confront the challenge. Kooresa impersonates Ramanuja and in the court refuses to be coerced into accepting the supremacy of Saivism. Kooresa is emphatic in declaring that Narayana is the Supreme Principle. In anger, the Chozha king orders Kooresa’s eyes to be pulled out.But Kooresa is quick to pull out his own eyes. When Ramanuja and Kooresa meet in Srirangam after 12 years, they are both overwhelmed. Ramanuja’s heart cries out for Kooresa’s blind state and he wishes that Kooresa pray to the Lord to restore his eyesight. Kooresa prays and is bestowed with the divine vision of the Lord. He is content and is not prompted to ask the Lord for anything else except salvation.But the Lord insists that Kooresa should ask for a boon. Kooresa wishes that whatever grace the Lord has shown him should also be extended to Narooran, a Vaishnava in the service of the Chozha king, despite the atrocities he had perpetrated in the court on the king’s orders.
