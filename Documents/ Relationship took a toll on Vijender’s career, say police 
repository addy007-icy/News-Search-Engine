Delhi Police officers say sub-inspector Vijender’s closeness with Nikita Chauhan was affecting his professional life. In fact, police had initiated departmental action against him for prolonged absence from duty.Deependra Pathak, Joint Commissioner of Police (South Western Range), said that when disciplinary issues were brought to the notice of Vijender’s seniors and it was learnt that he was not reporting for duty without getting leaves sanctioned, he was transferred to Ranhola police station.However, his conduct remained unchanged. The reason behind this was the time he was allegedly spending with Nikita.The duo was also believed to be involved in extortion, an angle the police say they are looking into.“Nikita was a news stringer with a weekly publication that has limited circulation in west Delhi. She had to stay in touch with the authorities, the police being one of them. This is how she was introduced to Vijender, who was then posted at the Uttam Nagar police station,” said Mr. Pathak.Vijender was married and had children. His wife had returned to her maternal family in Rajasthan where she filed a complaint of domestic violence in 2013, said Mr. Pathak. The complaint also mentioned Vijender’s alleged affair with “another woman” whose name he would bring up to humiliate her.Meanwhile, Nikita’s marriage to one Parvesh in the year 2011 was also believed to be on the rocks. Her husband had reportedly filed for divorce last year. This was confirmed by Parvesh’s lawyer Sushil Panwar, who said that the extra-marital affair had compelled him to take the step.However, things between Nikita and Vijender were strained since the second half of last year. Nikita had even approached the police with a complaint of harassment, but later withdrew it.
