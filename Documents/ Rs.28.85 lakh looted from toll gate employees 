Armed miscreants looted about Rs.28.85 lakh at gun point from toll gate employees near Khurda along National Highway 16 near here on Monday afternoon.The incident took place when an accountant and other two employees of the toll gate at Godipada were coming to deposit the amount in Punjab National Bank, Jankia. The three persons were in a small car. An SUV believed to be driven by the accused hit the vehicle from the behind and blocked its way.Two bike-borne masked miscreants coming from behind demanded the cash bag from an employee at gun point. After taking possession of the bag, they immediately fled. The SUV had already disappeared before that.Since cash collected from the toll gate could not be deposited on Saturday and Sunday, employees were coming to bank with the money on Monday. On being informed, police teams from Khurda as well as Jankia rushed to the spot. One employee had suffered minor injuries in the accident. Employees seemed to have not taken adequate precautions while moving with huge cash. The police had earlier warned banks and other organisations dealing with heavy cash to take safety measures. They should have taken escorts along with them even though the distance between the toll gate and bank is just 2.5 km.
