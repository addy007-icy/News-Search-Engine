“Normally, I start shooting at 5.30 a.m.,” were the first words I heard from P. C. Sreeram when setting up a shoot with him. When I pointed out that the plan was to shoot him in a studio, “7:30 then,” he replied.P. C. Sreeram likes shooting at dawn because “it is most beautiful when the morning sun hits the earth. After that, monotony sets in.”At my studio, he stood watching the images I had put up, and gazed for the longest at my portrait of Sriram Parasuram, my guru. Panic hit me when he said that I could have shot that photo in 50 other, better ways. A while later, after sifting through my remaining work, he added, “I was joking. You should hang all of the pictures.” I breathed a big sigh of relief.At the studio, I had already prepared the lighting I desired, but was a little wary of how he would react. “Just direct me,” he said.My assistant had the Macbeth Chart with him, that P. C. grabbed and placed in front of his face. While the chart is usually used to capture the skin tone right, it became a prop in his hands. In the hands of someone who looked utterly serious, the prop changed everything.
