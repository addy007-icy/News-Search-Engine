Former Member of Parliament Chinta Mohan launched yet another signature campaign on Thursday for the welfare of the health workers employed in various departments in the city.Dr. Mohan sought minimum wages of Rs. 12,000 each for the 10000 health workers employed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT), SVR Ruia Government General Hospital, SVIMS, APSRTC and the six universities in Tirupati. While flaying the TTD for paying a mere Rs.200 per day for the workers, who cleaned the waste generated by the tens of thousands of pilgrims thronging the Tirumala hills, he sought a minimum payment of Rs.400 a day, in view of the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities, exorbitant house rent and the school fee.Referring to the frequent visits of the Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to Tirupati, he said it yielded nothing concrete, except costing lakhs of rupees every time to the state exchequer.He demanded Mr. Naidu to open his mouth on the reported move to shift to Guntur the Rs.120-crore cancer hospital sanctioned to Tirupati. PCC Secretary R. Sreedevi took part in the programme.
