Nabarangpur district administration has decided to identify all tribal ‘desaris’ or witchdoctors in the district to check inhuman torture of newborns at their hands in the name of treatment.Speaking to The Hindu , the Nabarangpur District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) said efforts are being made to make a survey to identify and record all the ‘desaris’ involved in quackery in the district. This is expected to be completed in one month. Programmes would also be started for these tribal witchdoctors to make them aware of legal implications of superstitious practices used by them like branding by hot iron to cure stomach ailments. They would also be made aware of common diseases and their treatment, said the DCPO. “Most ‘desaris’ are also uneducated and are ignorant about modern methods. It is high time they know about proper health and medical care,” he added.
