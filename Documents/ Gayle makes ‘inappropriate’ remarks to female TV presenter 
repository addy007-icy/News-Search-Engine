West Indian batting star Chris Gayle has courted fresh controversy when he made “inappropriate” remarks to a female television presenter live on air after a Big Bash League cricket match.Gayle, who plays for the Melbourne Renegades in the T20 competition, was speaking to Channel 10 presenter Mel McLaughlin after he made a quick fire 41 runs of 15 balls in his team’s victory against Tasmania.“I wanted to come and have an interview with you as well, that’s the reason why I’m here... to see your eyes for the first time,” Gayle said.“Hopefully we win this game and we can have a drink after, don’t blush baby,” he added.McLaughlin, who appeared uncomfortable as a result of the 36-year-old Gayle’s remarks, said “I’m not blushing”, as she tried to continue with the interview.Cricketers such as former England captain Andrew Flintoff slammed Gayle for his act that was condemned by others as well on social media.After the incident, Big Bash League chief executive Anthony Everard released a statement on Twitter.“I heard Chris’ comments and they’re disrespectful and simply inappropriate. We’ll certainly be talking to him and the Renegades about it. This league is all about its appeal to kids, families and females. There’s just no place in the BBL or, for that matter, cricket anywhere for that sort of behaviour.”Gayle was also criticised for making inappropriate remarks to a female journalist, when he was asked how the felt about the pitch in the lead-up to a match in the Caribbean Premier League last year.
