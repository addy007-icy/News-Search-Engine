Joseph, who opened the district centre, urged banks to extend loans to needy expatriates.

Despite repeated requests from the government, only four banks were willing to associate with the programme. He pointed out that the expatriates were sending Rs.1.5 lakh crore every year to Kerala through the banks. He also urged the banks to change the attitude in respect of lending as part of rehabilitation package.K.C.
