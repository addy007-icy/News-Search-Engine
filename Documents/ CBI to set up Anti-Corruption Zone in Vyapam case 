The Centre has given nod to the CBI to set up the second Anti-Corruption Zone, primarily to speed up investigations and trials in the multi-crore Vyapam scam, an official said on Thursday.The Central government has given sanction for the formation of Anti-Corruption Zone II. Under the zone, branches will be set up here in this fiscal, Central Bureau of Investigationâ€™s press information officer R K Gaur told PTI over phone.For setting up the zone, the Centre has sanctioned 321 posts for the investigation and trial of Vyapam scam cases in the current financial year, he said, adding that 237 personnel from the rank of constable to deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police will be recruited.Besides, 20 legal officers and 64 clerical staffers will be recruited in the zone which will be headquartered in Delhi, he said.According to sources in CBI, the central agency was facing manpower crunch to provide a fillip to the investigations and trial into the Vyapam scam.The CBI has registered 112 cases against more than 2,000 accused, including high-level officials and politicians in the multi-layered scam, as per the sources.The STF had also booked Governor Ram Naresh Yadav in a forest guard recruitment scam conducted by Vyapam last year.But, the FIR against him was quashed by Madhya Pradesh High Court, which observed that he enjoys immunity against criminal prosecution as long as he holds the gubernatorial post.Over 2,000 people have been arrested in connection with the scam, which came to light in 2013, according to sources in MP police which had earlier investigated the scam before the Supreme Court handed over the probe to CBI.Majority of the people arrested in the scam had been released after the courts across the state granted them bails.
