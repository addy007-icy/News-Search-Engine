A man recently bled to death after being run over by a bus at Pazhavangady junction. Apparently the passersby and the police stood by and watched, waiting for someone else to take the man to the hospital. People should realise that their dear ones too could meet with accidents.The excuse made by the police for not taking the injured man to the hospital was not convincing. Of course, the passerby could have hesitated for fear of getting tangled in legal procedures afterwards. Though the authorities have been saying that all such hassles have been done away with, the public are yet to be convinced. Awareness sessions regarding this should be taken up right from the school level.T. RanjitKowdiarDug up, forgottenThe Kerala Water Authority had dug up the Seekaryam-Gandhipuram road for laying pipelines under the JICA project. A year after the completion of the work, the authorities have not bothered to the re-lay the Gandhipuram road. The residents have to tackle many difficulties, the prime one being dust. Many complaints were given, yet nothing concrete has happened. Will there be a solution?Arun Kesav C.M.SreekariyamReaders may e-mail their letters to tvmreadersmail@gmail.com
