Regretting that the voting percentage in elections was not increasing up to the expected level despite the increase in the literacy rate in the country, M. Sundresh Babu, Chief Executive Officer of Vijayapura Zilla Panchayat, has said that youths were not showing interest in the electoral process.Speaking after inaugurating a National Voters Day programme at the Government PU College for Girls here on Monday, he said that the objective of the programme was to involve more youths in the electoral process.“India is a country with the highest number of youths in the world; their participation in the electoral process is essential in a democratic set-up like India. Thus the Election Commission of India has turned the focus on youths,” he said.Mr. Babu said that the involvement of the people in the electoral process was essential to uphold the aspirations of the Constitution which guarantees equality to all irrespective of caste and gender.“Voting rights provide an opportunity to citizens to select a government that ensures that the fundamental rights are upheld and the aspirations of the Constitution are fulfilled,” he said.Stating that a person gets voting right at the age of 18, he said that it was the age when the person attains both physical and mental maturity.“Thus, being mature persons, youths must act responsibly and vote in every election without fail which is not just their right but duty as well,” Mr. Babu said.He said that the theme of this year’s event is “Be proud to be a voter and strengthen democracy”.Additional Deputy Commissioner Gangubai Mankar explained the norms required to get a new Election Photo Identity Card and for getting changes made in an exiting card.As many as five persons who have attained 18 years of age were given EPIC.Earlier in the day, students participated in rangoli drawing in prominent places such as Siddeshwara Temple, Ambedkar Circle and the Government PU College for Girls as part of the awareness programme.Deputy Commissioner D. Randeep was present.
