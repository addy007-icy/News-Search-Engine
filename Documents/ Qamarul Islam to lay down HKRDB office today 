Municipal Administration and Minority Affairs Minister Qamarul Islam, who will lay down office of chairman of the Hyderabad Karnataka Region Development Board (HKRDB) after completing two years on Thursday, said on Wednesday that he was happy and satisfied with the achievements of HKRDB during his tenure. “Although I would have been more happier if the physical and financial progress of HKRDB was still higher, I practically got only 14 months to achieve this progress after getting approval for action plans from Governor Vajubhai Vala,” he said.
