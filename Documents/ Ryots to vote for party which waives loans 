The Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Kootu Iyakkam, a joint body of 92 farmers associations, has announced that farmers will vote for the party that promised to waive crop loans in cooperative societies and nationalised banks.The team of leaders from 15 districts including Erode, Tiruchi, Gobichettipalayam and Krishnagiri have been meeting leaders of various political parties seeking support for their cause. “After the drought in 2012-13, many farmers have not been able to repay their loans and their financial burden has only increased. This year we had excess rain in some districts and insufficient rainfall in others leading to crop loss. We have met leaders of political parties including O. Panneerselvam of AIADMK, M.K.Stalin of DMK, Vijayakant of DMDK and S. Ramadoss of PMK to press our demand,” said Iyakkam presidium chairman P. Ayyakannu, adding that every party responded in a positive manner.The Iyakkam is at present garnering support from farmers in the districts. “Though prices of commodities have spiralled and salaries too have increased, farm produce alone has not appreciated over the last several decades. In 1970, 60 kg of paddy was Rs. 40 and now it is Rs. 880. But eight grams of gold, which was priced at Rs. 120 now costs over Rs. 20,000,” said Iyakkam general secretary V.N. Magudeswaran.The farmers are planning a conference on February 19 at Erode where over two lakh farmers would congregate and decide the next course of action.
