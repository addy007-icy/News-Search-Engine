The Bharatiya Janata Party has taken strong exception to Kerala Tourism’s Rs.600-crore pilgrim tourism proposal for Sabarimala.A.N. Radhakrishnan, BJP State general secretary, told The Hindu that the party always stood for providing foolproof basic pilgrim amenities at Sabarimala and not for developing the sacred grove of Lord Ayyapa into a tourism destination.Kerala Tourism has submitted the Rs.600-crore proposal for developing Sabarimala, Guruvayur and certain other temples under the Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spirituality Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) scheme of the Union Ministry of Tourism, he said.Mr. Radhakrishnan said Kerala Tourism’s proposal included setting up of modern buildings, including a Yatri Nivas, at Sabarimla which was against the very ethos of the Sabarimala pilgrimage.Without proper studyHe alleged that the project proposals for presentation before the Union Ministry had been prepared without conducting any proper study, site inspection, or considering the custom and tradition of the Sabarimala pilgrimage.In a letter to Union Minister for Culture and Tourism Mahesh Sharma, the BJP State general secretary alleged that Kerala Tourism had prepared the report without even consulting the Travancore Devaswom Board or any other stakeholder at Sabarimala.The letter says any development project for implementation at Sabarimala should be made part of the master plan and its guidelines approved by the Supreme Court of India. However, Kerala Tourism’s project proposals didn’t satisfy the guidelines prescribed for the same, he alleged.Eco-friendly projectsMr. Radhakrishnan said what Sabarimala required were eco-friendly projects that protected the pilgrims’ interests. As per the master plan, only community accommodation should be facilitated at Sabarimala and hence Yatri Nivas-type tourism amenity could not be permitted in the sacred grove. What Sabarimala needed were resting area for pilgrims, safe electrical distribution network, foolproof sewage network and a safe drinking water supply network, he said.He called upon the Union Minister not to consider the proposal aimed at promoting tourism in Sabarimala situated in the Periyar Tiger Reserve.
