Recruitment agencies and brokers are cheating housemaids planning to work in the Gulf countries of lakhs of rupees, and also hiding the real nature of work there.These facts came to light during an investigation into human trafficking cases reported in the South Zone during the last few months. “If the women refuses to work, their employer says they paid them thousands of Riyals as advance money. The reality is that the women never got the money and the middlemen and recruitment agencies are pocketing it,” a police official explained.Recently, a woman from Srikakulam, who was rescued by a social worker from the old city, narrated her ordeal to the police.She complained that the broker, who hails from her native place, offered 3,000 Saudi Riyal as monthly salary and told that there were already two other housemaids and the workload was less.“But when I reached there, they made me work for 16 hours a day and abused me when I refused to do so,” she told the police.In a few cases, young women are being sent on visit visas and later forced into prostitution.“In several cases, we caught hold of the brokers and pressurised them to arrange the return of the victims after contacting the main agent or their employers,” another police official said.Based on the information provided by the victims, the city police reportedly caught a gang headed by one Jaggu of Guntur and Nagaraju from Hyderabad who are involved in many such cases. The police also raided several offices in the old city and seized passports.The police have also stumbled upon a racket where local brokers reported cheated several persons who planned to undertake the Umra pilgrimage.
