Silicon Valley University (SVU) and Northwestern Polytechnic University (NPU), both mired in controversy over student deportations, have national accreditation, the one which is usually granted to faith-based universities and institutes which offer vocational programmes, clarified authorities of EduUS and US India Education Programme (USIEP).Renuka Raja Rao, Country Coordinator, USIEP who was in the city on Thursday, said both the universities were accredited by Accreditation Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. “This comes under national accreditation,” she said even as she clarified that USIEF often recommends students to opt for State accreditation or regional accreditation.“State or regional accreditation ensures students of certain standards that the colleges would have,” Ms. Rao explained. She, however, did not want to comment on the reasons behind en masse student deportations that Hyderabad faced during the past one month. Even on December 6, over 15 students were deported from New York and Washington.Currently, the total number of students deported from the US for trying to take admission the coming semester would now be over 600. USIEF would want students to do thorough research before they opt for any university, authorities said. “We advise the students to undergo a five-step process where first they research their option, then get the proper financing, send the electronic application including the statement of purpose, get the visa and then prepare for studying in the US. If they follow all the five steps they will be able to get a good college and reach the US safe,” Ms. Rao said.
