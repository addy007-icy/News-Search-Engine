A study report on the Fort Kochi boat tragedy by Additional Director General of Police K. Padmakumar has reiterated the call for replacing the existing boats plying the Vypeen-Fort Kochi route with twin engine boats.The report, prepared after due consultation with various stake holders, including technical experts and fishermen, stipulates the use of twin engine boats for plying the route, which usually witnesses strong currents due to the regular high and low tide activity.“Chances of single engine boats drifting towards the sea are highly likely in case of an engine failure. The twin engine boats, however, are spared from this as they can be operated even if one engine fails,” the report says.It further prefers boats that fall in the catamaran or roll in–roll out category for s the route as they can withstand tidal activity and strong winds.Regarding the movement of tourist boats, the report suggests that these vessels should not be permitted to move towards the West beyond the Vallarpadam terminal.Similarly, tourist boats should be banned from plying before sunrise and after sunset as the absence of light will hamper rescue operations, in case of emergencies.It also stipulates the installation of high-tech navigation equipment on board the tourist vessels, including GPS and other communication system to pass on messages such as weather updates, emergency situations or about the movement of cargo vessels, etc. Besides, all tourist boats should strictly deploy one employee for look out duty, in addition to a licensed srank, an engine driver, two laskers, as suggested by the Kerala Inland Vessels Rules, 2010.Operators should limit the number of tourists standing at the upper deck to one third of its capacity at any given point of time. The boats are highly likely to loose their stability if more passengers are allowed on the upper deck and capsize even in case of a mild wind.
