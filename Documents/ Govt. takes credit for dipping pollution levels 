The Delhi government on Thursday credited its odd-even vehicle rationing experiment with bringing down levels of PM 2.5, which it says is the most prominent pollutant in the Capital’s air.Transport Minister Gopal Rai said the city’s air quality “would have been worse” had the scheme not been in place. Mr. Rai said the average quantity of PM 2.5 — fine respirable particulate matter — was recorded at 245 micrograms per cubic metre on Thursday which means that the quality of air in the city is still ‘very poor’.As per data recorded at 18 locations in the Capital’s interior on Wednesday, PM 2.5 levels were recorded less than 300 (ug/m3), while data from nine of these posited that these levels were recorded at less than 200.The Delhi Traffic Police on Wednesday challaned 130 car owners for violating the scheme, while the Transport Department fined 392 drivers. According to the Department, 71 of these were cars and 321 were auto-rickshaws.On Thursday, the Traffic Police challaned 95 car owners for not adhering to the scheme, while the Transport Department fined 400 drivers. Of these 41 were cars and 359 were auto-rickshaws.Even as the number of auto-rickshaw drivers fined continued to soar, Mr. Rai insisted that a majority of auto drivers were in fact cooperating with commuters and the government.“There is significant compliance of the provisions of the scheme by owners and drivers of private vehicles, which is being noticed on a daily basis. Hopefully, the trend will continue,” said Muktesh Chander, Special Commissioner of Police (traffic).Addressing the media after inspecting the prepaid taxi and auto booth at the New Delhi railway station, the Transport Minister said “rumours” were being spread about “harassment” by auto drivers.But, Mr. Rai added, “prima facie” most taxi and auto drivers were cooperating with Delhiites.“I came to the station as many people were complaining that auto drivers were harassing them during the odd-even campaign in Delhi. There are some people who defame auto drivers and we are taking strict action against them,” he said.Adding that some auto and taxi unions had, in fact, complained of issues they were facing due to the regulations of the scheme that will be discussed after January 15, Mr. Rai congratulated the citizens of the Capital for adopting car-pooling.The Transport Minister also urged commuters to utilise buses under the Paryavaran Bus Seva and the Delhi Metro which, he said, had the capacity to cater to an additional four lakh commuters on a daily basis.Transport Minister Gopal Rai said the city’s air 'would have been worse' had the schemenot been in place
