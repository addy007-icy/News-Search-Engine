Acting Chief Justice of the Hyderabad High Court Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale on Saturday mooted awarding incentives to villages which have zero litigation. He said such a practice existed in Maharashtra and Telangana State government could think about doing so.Inaugurating the new court building at Utnoor in Adilabad district, Justice Bhosale wondered if a time would come when courts would get closed owing to lack of litigations. He advocated resolution of disputes through mediation instead of litigation. Assuring advocates and lawyers that dispute resolution through mediation will not render them workless, the Chief Justice said their work in fact would increase. He talked about the changing face of handling litigation in which advocates can work even sitting at home.Explaining his point of view, Justice Bhosale said practice outside the court meant advocates can offer their services through legal outsourcing. They can help out legal firms in America by sitting at home, he added.Earlier, the Chief Justice inaugurated a residential quarter of the Junior Civil Judge at Utnoor, a special Sessions Mahila Court at Adilabad courts complex and a mediation and conciliation centre, Vikasam, the state-of-the-art home for the disabled children of tribals at Utnoor and district-level Tribal Sports Meet at KB complex, Utnoor.High Court Judges G.
