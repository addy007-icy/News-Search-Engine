Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the Centre’s announcement for launching Startup Mission and suggested drastic reforms to be implemented in university system to encourage innovation.While underlining the importance of R&D, VCCI vice-president A.V. Monish Row in a representation to Niti Aayog CEO-designate Amitabh Kant said creating another Silicon Valley in India was highly unlikely at the moment given the lack of research universities, government funding in research as well as lack of centres of excellence.The country's university system is woefully lacking in facilities that encourage the talented young student to innovate whilst studying.“Mediocrity and regional or other bias is dictating our policy when openness and excellence are not recognised in the whole system,” Mr. Row stated.India needs to develop a culture of strong identification with the customer and sincere passion for what the entrepreneur believes. “Openness to good ideas no matter where they come from and figuring out how get the product to market will be critical if we are to get out of the syndrome of taking direction from the engineering department of a firm or from following the existing market place,” he said.
