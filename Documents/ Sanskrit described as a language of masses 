Padma Shekhar, Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka Sanskrit University, on Friday stressed on the need to study and do research on the evolution of Sanskrit language to re-construct Indian history.She was speaking after inaugurating “Samskrutotsav-2016”, a cultural fest focussing on Sanskrit language, here.She said that the cultural and political changes that took place in ancient India had been documented in Sanskrit texts. These Sanskrit texts would serve as a valuable source of reference for historians engaged in the re-construction of Indian history, she said.Describing Sanskrit as a language of masses, she said learning of this language was not a prerogative of any community. Social reformer late B.R. Ambedkar, who strove relentlessly for the uplift of the poor and marginalised sections of society, had accorded importance to the learning of ancient Indian languages such as Sanskrit and Prakrit, she said.It was heartening to note that even the students in Western countries were evincing interest in learning Sanskrit in recent times, she said.The programme had been organised by D.V.S. Samiti and Department of Kannada and Culture. Gamaka artist Markandeya Avadhani was felicitated on the occasion. President of D.V.S. Samiti K.G. Subrahmanya, principal of D.V.S. PU College H. Anand and lecturer Bhaskar were present.
