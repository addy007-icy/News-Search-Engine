: The works of S.H. Raza, instantly recognised for his signature ‘bindu’, pop-up as surprise treats at several auctions, private collections and group shows. However, when the artist comes up with a solo show after a year, the experience is enthralling and it is a treat to see how the living legend, who turns 94 this year, continues to paint.Titled Nirantar, the exhibition will be hosted at the Vadhera Art Gallery till February 24. It showcases his latest works and his experiments with formal elements in painting.The influence of Western Modernism from his time spent in France to his brush with Tantrism once he moved back to India, all while incorporating strokes inspired from Expressionism, are on full display.The artist’s ‘bindu’ continues to be the defining theme of his works but the current collection is done in more subdued tones. Simple, yet complex and colourful.Speaking about the exhibition, Director of the gallery Arun Vadehra says, "what is fascinating is that when he applies colour, to the layman’s eye, it looks the same of the palate that converts into a tonality so masterfully achieved on canvas. When I ask how he decides what colours to juxtapose with another, he intriguingly says it happens automatically, much like a practiced musician, the notes simply spill forth instinctively.”In one of the works in his current series, Raza brings together the gestural strokes of his landscape with the black bindu and uses text to form a narrative about the ‘dot’ as a lover who has come from the sky to earth upon his request.The show is on at Vadhera Art Gallery, D-40. Defence Colony till February 24.
