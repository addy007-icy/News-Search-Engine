A rant against the city and Kannadigas here ended up in a criminal complaint against a Marathi-speaking software engineer.Responding to an article on an online forum, where a post against a bus conductor for speaking only in the “local” language was gaining traction, software engineer Pritish Kumar Patil resorted to abuse against south Indians.The group- Samanya Kannadiga -lashed out at the engineer on the social media, and even published his personal information online.Having received much flak, the techie issued a written apology, saying his comments stemmed out of a “lack of judgment”, and that he had not intended to hurt anyone.He further implored them not to approach the State police.However, Sandeep Parswanath from the group, filed a complaint on January 3 with the Gangammanagudi Police Station, in whose jurisdiction Mr. Patil stays.A case has been filed under section 505 (making provocative statements).“We do not accept the apology as this is not the first time someone is making racist statements against Kannadigas. We put the letter to more than 18,000 people who followed our social media page, and they urged us to file a complaint and make it an example to others who may post something like this,” says Mr. Parswanath, whose group has circulated the identity of the software engineer to “ensure he doesn’t get a job elsewhere”.The group is also approaching the women’s commission against a Jaipur-based person who had agreed to Mr. Patil’s statement with derogatory statements about women in the city. Mr. Patil was unavailable for comment.
