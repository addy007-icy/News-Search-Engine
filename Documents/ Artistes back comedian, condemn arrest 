Actors, writers and directors associated with the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) and Cine & TV artistes Association( CINTAA ) came together on Monday to condemn the arrest of comedian actor Kiku Sharda on January 13.Sharda was arrested for hurting religious sentiments of a community of followers of controversial godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.Among the artists present were Renuka Shahane, Ashutosh Rana, Manoj and Seema Pahwa, Kamlesh Pandey, Salim Arif, Lubna Salim and Vrajesh Hirjee.The artistes also appealed for an introspection into the Section 295 A of the Indian Penal Code, under which Sharda was arrested.Renuka Shahane said, “It clearly states that a person can be arrested only if he intentionally hurts religious sentiments. Firstly, mimicry is not hurting, it’s a form of flattery. Secondly, it was not hurting intentionally. And who decides if Dera Sacha Sauda is a religion. If there are more such cults and religions, this can happen to others. This law needs to be looked at and clearly defined.”Sharda was picked up by the cops at night from the sets of popular TV show Comedy Nights with Kapil and was sent to judicial custody in Haryana for 14 days. He was released five days ago after he apologised.Rang de Basanti writer Pandey, also the president of FWICE, said that Sharda’s case was symbolic of the larger debate about freedom of expression in the country.“The government earns from the entertainment tax we pay and in return is supposed to protect our interest. If there is no freedom then what are we doing here and how is this a free, democratic country.”Arif pointed out that there is already self-censorship happening at the creation level, limiting the scope of art.Actor Om Puri, who couldn’t attend the press conference, gave a statement over the phone and gave instances of Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen saying how humour and parody are essential to any democratic country.Amit Behl, chairperson, CINTAA, said that there is a lot of anger in the industry. They plan to write a letter to the President to look into the scope and ambit of Section 295.Ask who decides whether Dera Sacha Sauda is a religion
