Members of the AP DSC â€™98 Qualified Association, candidates who passed the DSC test in 1998 but are still waiting for posting, met at Sarada Ramakrishna Vidyalayam in Gandhinagar to discuss their problems on Sunday. They demanded that the Government immediately look into the issue of an inordinate delay in postings of the qualified candidates. Pointing to the fact that Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had asked the education officials in that State to take immediate steps to ensure that the qualified candidates be posted to vacant teacher posts, the association member said AP Government should follow suit and do the needful.
