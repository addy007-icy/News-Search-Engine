Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V. M. Sudheeran is embarking on a month-long ‘Kerala Raksha Yatra’ from Kasaragod on Monday.The yatra which would wind its way through the 140 assembly constituencies has a long list of objectives that includes campaigns against fascism, communalism, and intolerance, unpopular policies of the Central government, political violence, and social evils, not to mention secularism, comprehensive Kerala development and empowerment of youth.Mr. Sudheeran is also expected to highlight the achievements of the United Democratic Front government.The yatra like many others organised by its earlier versions by other Congress leaders, begins from Kumbla, symbolically reckoned as the northern most tip of the State to conclude in Thiruvananthapuram on February 9.As far as Mr. Sudheeran is concerned, the yatra is a major challenge, coming as it does in the context of delivery as KPCC president and a leader who claims to have a rating in Kerala politics.The yatra is being launched in the backdrop of the show of unity by the troika in the Congress party in Kerala, comprising Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala and Sudheeran himself.The unity show has also blunted the criticisms of the UDF constituents to some extent.The show, according to party insiders, has only a symbolic value, and the success of the yatra depends how well the ‘unity message’ would percolate to the lower levels of the party hierarchy.The revamp of the District Congress Committee has turned out to be a messy affair, with jumbo committees being put into place. The jumbo committees, it is feared, would make functioning of the DCCs difficult, but it had to be broad based in view of the Kerala Raksha Yatra, sources said.Mr. Sudheeran has gone all the way out to make the yatra a grand success, giving the impression of being well-organised enough to be converted into an election launcher for Assembly elections coming up in a few months time.The KPCC president is faced with another problem – identifying the party’s main enemy in Kerala.The CPI(M) continues to be its main political opponent in the State as of now. But the performance of the BJP in the recent local bodies’ elections on the strength of its alliance with the SNDP has complicated matters for the Congress.The onus will be on Mr. Sudheeran to redefine this platform for the Congress and it remains to be seen whether he would utilise his yatra to achieve this.
