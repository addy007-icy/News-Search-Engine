A team of delegates who came from different parts of the country were seen debating over the topics such as United Nations General Assembly (bringing reforms to Security Council); U.N. Human Rights Commission (children in armed conflicts); U.N. Security Council (the threat to international peace and security due to rise in extremism in Syria and Iraq) and U.N. Environmental Programme (combating the effects of mercury poisoning).Covering a number of sub-themes under each head, the delegates from Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Vellore, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad came together to express their views in Vizag Model United Nations – 2016 (VMUN) that began on Saturday. It was interesting to see the quality homework done by the delegates in each committee and bring in serious deliberations on international politics, debate and draft a series of workable solutions to put an end to issues plaguing the world.“A lot of research has gone into understanding each subject. Since I represent United Arab Emirates, it is important for me to know the interest of the nation before coming up with any resolution,” says Srinidhi Muralidharan, a delegate from Hyderabad.The arena provided an opportunity for youngsters to develop their leadership skills. “Forums such as these will help one breakaway from stereotypes, broaden the perspectives on diverse affairs and more importantly, overcome fear of public speaking,” explains Pranav Prabhu, a student of Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad. The top resolutions passed in the forum will be forwarded to United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan. “From a total participation of 90 last year to 120, the convention has gone a long way in drawing the attention of the students across the country,” says Pradyumna Sarma, general secretary of the convention.Delegates from Visakhapatnam, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Vellore, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad take part
