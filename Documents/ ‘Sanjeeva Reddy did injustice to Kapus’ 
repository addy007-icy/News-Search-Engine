Kapu Welfare and Development Corporation Chairman Chalamalasetti Ramunujaiah on Tuesday charged former President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy with doing gross injustice to the Kapu community by listing it as forward caste. “If my statement is proved wrong, I am ready to hang myself from the Godavari bridge,” he said.Briefing the media on Tuesday, along with East Godavari ZP chairperson Namana Rambabu, Rajamahendravaram MLA Dr. Akula Satyanarayana and Mayor Pantam Rajani, the Chairman said the community had been listed as backward class during British rule, and when Mr. Sanjeeva Reddy became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, it was removed from the list. “After Damodaram Sanjeevaiah became the Chief Minister, our community again got BC status,” he added. The press conference ended abruptly when supporters of former Minister Mudragada Padmanabham barged into the hall and shouted slogans. They gave a representation to the Chairman and told him that the Manjunatha Commission was not necessary, and that the government could directly issue an ordinance granting BC status to Kapus.If I’m proved incorrect, I will hang myself from the Godavari bridgeChalamalasetti Ramanujaiah
