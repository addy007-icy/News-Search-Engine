TTD Executive Officer D. Sambasiva rao on Tuesday directed the officials to complete all the pending works, including repairs to the ghat road, by the end of March.At a meeting with the heads of various departments at Annamaiah Bhavan, Dr. Rao said the period till the end of March was a lean season wherein the pilgrim turnout was expected to be low and hence the officials should gear up to complete the works. The TTDâ€™s garden wing, headed by Srinivasulu, was asked to chalk out an action plan on the concept of vertical gardening and ground the project before the onset of summer vacations.Appreciating the Power-Point presentation on the luggage and baggage counters at Tirumala, he urged TTD CVSO Nagendra kumar to come out with a more innovative mechanism to ease the travails of the pilgrims in collecting their luggage.
