The thought of an audit seemed to have spooked the BJP leadership of the municipal corporations on Friday, a day after they welcomed the inquiry committee.On Wednesday, the Delhi government had cited the ongoing strikes by municipal workers, who haven’t been paid in months, as the reason for setting up a committee to look into the functioning of the three municipalities.The committee was set up by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met the three municipal commissioners with regard to the financial crisis they face.Putting up a brave front, the leaders of the three corporations had said on Thursday that they had nothing to hide and would be open to the audit. But by Friday, the leaders were singing a different tune. The Mayors of the three corporations even met Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung to complain about the “illegal” committee. sThey told Mr. Jung that Mr. Sisodia had no legal right to issue such an order, which they termed a “political stunt”.“The Comptroller and Auditor General already audits our accounts, plus we have the chief municipal auditor. This new committee is just politicising the matter,” said Ravinder Gupta, Mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.Mr. Gupta had on Thursday said that the corporation was “ready for any audit”, though he had raised concerns about the committee being headed by a Delhi government officer.On Friday, Mr. Gupta also wrote to Mr. Kejriwal asking him to implement the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission that gives the civic bodies a bigger share of the taxes collected in the Capital. The report of the Commission has been pending with the Delhi government since 2013, and the BJP-led corporations have accused the Aam Aadmi Party dispensation of delaying the implementation deliberately.
