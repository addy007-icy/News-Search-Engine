Pramod Madhwaraj, MLA, said here on Friday that low-floor government buses, under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), will be introduced in Udupi, as soon as possible.He was speaking after inaugurating a workshop on “Issues related to women”, organised by the Dr. G. Shankar Government Women’s College, Rotary Club and Native Organisation, here.Mr. Madhwaraj said that 30 low-floored buses were expected to be provided here. There was no question of bowing to the private bus lobby on this issue.There had been complaints of girl and women students being mistreated in private buses.Since there was a lot of rush in private buses, some perverted men were using such occasions to misbehave with girl and women passengers.Such instances had to be curbed and those indulging in such acts should be sternly dealt with, he said.The low-floor government buses would run in time. All arrangements would be made to see that they stopped closer to schools and colleges to help students.“Instances of sexual harassment and assault on women had made the entire mankind hang its head in shame,” he said.Workshops such as the present one would go a long way in creating awareness about issues connected to sexual harassment and atrocities, Mr. Madhwaraj said.Virupaksha Devaramane, psychiatrist, Vishwanath Shenoy, social worker, Alen Vinay Louis, Assistant Rotary Governor, Sunil Mathew, advocate, were present.Yashodha Maindan welcomed the gathering. Premananda Kalmady delivered the introductory remarks.
