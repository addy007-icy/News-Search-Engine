Any new projects aimed at reducing the risk of floods in Chennai may now receive financial support.The State government has asked line agencies to submit proposals on flood risk reduction. If accepted, these proposals are likely to get off the ground quickly, with the help of World Bank funding, made possible by the governmentâ€™s Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project.Chennai Corporation, Water Resources Department and the Highways Department are expected to submit proposals relating to flood risk reduction.Absence of structures to mark the elevation of each of the roads with reference to the mean sea level is one of the factors hindering efforts to design flood-proof civic infrastructure.Chennai Corporation and the Highways Department are likely to submit proposals relating to such works. For instance, many arterial roads including Rajiv Gandhi Salai and Thoraipakkam-Pallavaram Radial Road have been constructed without factoring in the elevation with respect to the mean sea level.These roads had a role in the flooding of various areas. Drains and new canals to prevent flooding in such neighbourhoods are likely to be part of the new proposal.Under the earlier Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project, projects to enhance the ability of coastal communities to deal with natural disasters were proposed.Following the floods, the civic bodies are likely to prepare project proposals to improve the capacity of residents in all parts of the city to respond promptly and effectively to an emergency.
