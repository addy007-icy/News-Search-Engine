Margamkali is one of those traditional art forms that manage to stay afloat owing to arts festivals conducted in the State.The folk art of Syrian Christians involves a group of dancers performing around a traditional lamp in a symbolic representation of the Christ standing among the disciples.“Sadly, besides a few functions, the art form has currently been restricted to school art festivals,” says E.T. Sebastian of Wayanad, who has been training teams at the high school (HS) and higher secondary school (HSS) levels for nearly 27 years. He recounts the times when Margamkali used to be a common feature of Syrian Christian weddings and festivals.Excelling in Margamkali required perfect synchronisation among the group members, besides great amount of effort by each individual. The song that is sung during performances comprises the ‘Vandana Ganam’ and one of the 14 ‘padas’ or stanzas on the legends of St. Thomas, one of the 12 Apostles. The performances are adjudged on the basis of various parameters including the presentation and the costumes of the participants.K.C. James, another trainer from Kottayam, says the traditional dance was never exclusive for women. However, at the time of its inclusion in the school arts festivals in 1985, Margamkali was listed in the festival manual as a girls’ competition.Nineteen teams competed in the HS level competition of Margamkali that was held at the Poojappura grounds on Thursday. A team from Presentation HSS, Kozhikode, led by Gopika Prakash, emerged victorious in the competition. S.H.G.H.S. Bharananganam, Kottayam, and Sacred Hearts Girls HS, Thalassery, jointly occupied the second place. B.C.G.H.S. Kunnamkulam, Thrissur, came third.
