At least two stretches of Namma Metro are up and running, but how accessible are they? Be it the last-mile connectivity to the stations or the ease with which commuters cross the road to reach them, the ‘Station Accessibility Plan’ aims to address it all.The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) is spearheading the project, which will look at making 15 Metro stations safe and accessible. While some plans are nearing completion, others are in the interim stage. The plan for Indiranagar station is ready for implementation.DULT Commissioner V. Manjula told The Hindu that it was expected that more people would walk to the Metro stations, other than using bicycles and buses.“When we say chaos, people automatically think of elevated roads or flyovers instead of correcting the geometry there,” she said, explaining the basis on which the safe access designs will be made.Possible changesSome of the interventions that one can expect are junction design and multi-modal transport (i.e. having autorickshaw bays and bus stops closer to exits and entrances of the Metro stations). At the same time, ‘traffic calming measures’ such as table tops (slight elevations on the road to slow down traffic), foot overbridges, wider footpaths and cycle tracks will find mention.With a few stations having their share of challenges, one can expect a number of area-specific interventions as well.For example, at Sampige Road station (Swastik), the issue that will gain credence is safe connectivity across the railway line. DULT officials also said Tumakuru Road was a major concern, with the road itself “a barrier”.However, it will all be up to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to implement the designs.Some better accessibility aspects, like wider footpaths to facilitate easier pedestrian movement, are already being taken care of under the TenderSURE project, officials said.
