Days before the Sankranthi festival, the otherwise busy Arepalle Rangampet village in Chandragiri mandal wears a deserted look. The stretch designated for the much-awaited ‘Pasuvula Panduga’ is marked with dung, indicating a good presence of livestock.‘Pasuvula Panduga’, considered a traditional cattle festival, is observed every year during Kanuma (i.e., the third day of the Sankranthi festival), to appease gods for protecting and enhancing cattle wealth in the village. Before the commencement of the event, cattle are colourfully decorated with a slate-like object fastened between their horns. The animals are then forced to run through a narrow path leading into the fields, flanked by villagers on the either side. The objective of the sport is to snatch the slate-like object.“The event is harmless and generally goes on without any major mishaps,” said V. Hari Krishna, a farmer from A. Rangampet village.‘It is not Jallikattu’The villagers decry the comparison of the event to Jallikattu of Tamil Nadu. Many of them vouched for the safety of the animals, along with that of people, and asserted it was just a “festival of livestock”. However, veterinary experts said cattle involved would be subjected to enormous physical and mental trauma.
