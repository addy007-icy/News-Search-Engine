They lay out plantain leaves, serve water and food, and after hundreds have eaten, they work quick time to remove the leaves, clean the tables, and lay out fresh leaves.Among the army of people at work the festival kitchen at Government Girls High School, Neyyattinkara, are National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers of Marayamuttam government school.The 34 volunteers, both boys and girls, studying in Plus Two, are divided into batches, and start early and work late into the night.They begin by serving breakfast at the hall, to be followed by lunch. Their own lunch is at 10.30 a.m., so that they are free to serve others the rest of the time. By the time they eat next, it is teatime. But they are not free to leave yet. With competitions extending late into the night, dinner is to be served.However, these youngsters are not complaining. “It’s only for four days,” say Akash and Gokul, two of the volunteers. With no time to watch even a single event, they are on their toes all through the day under the guidance of their teacher Ayyappan. And if it is late by the time they wind up for the day, they do not head home, but stay back till morning when they leave to catch up on some sleep and then be back again for a fresh round of serving. — Staff Reporter
