At least 12 people were killed and 10 injured on Saturday when a bus carrying tourists, including Chinese nationals, rammed into a jeep in Uttar Pradeshâ€™s Balrampur district, the police said.The accident apparently occurred due to dense fog in the morning.A police official said the tourist bus had more than two dozen Chinese tourists who were travelling to Sarnath, a city 13 km from Varanasi, for a day on the Buddhist circuit. Except the bus driver, who suffered some injuries, all passengers were safe.Though none of the bus passengers suffered serious injuries, 11 people travelling in the jeep died on the spot. One person died while being taken to hospital.In separate incidents, dense fog and poor visibility also led to two other accidents in different parts of the state, leaving three people dead.The police have urged people to drive slowly on highways as poor visibility is fraught with risks. - IANS
