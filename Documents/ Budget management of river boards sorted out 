A ticklish problem of management of the budget of Krishna and Godavari river management boards which were set up under State bifurcation law to resolve water sharing disputes between the two States was sorted out following an understanding between the State governments.The Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments had allotted Rs. 5 crore each to the boards in 2015-16 and the same was proposed at Rs. 4 crore in 2016-17. Instead of the boards being allowed to spend the funds directly, the governments retained the right to operate the money initially. It was only after the governments authorised use of the budget head that the money was spent.In these circumstances, the last meeting of Godavari board in December 2014 discussed that the drawing and disbursing officer (DDO) of the boards be entrusted with cheque drawing power. The bills for expenditure towards requirements of the boards would be countersigned by the DDO and member-secretary and presented to the State governments for debiting the amount against budget head till such time the authorisation was given.However, both governments expressed that the arrangement was not workable as the budget was maintained by their pay and accounts offices. Sometimes, it might even lead to non-payment of urgent bills in time. They suggested that, instead, both governments deposit the money in advance in the savings accounts of the boards which may be operated independently by the board secretariats and the unspent amount in the accounts did not lapse at the end of financial year.Accordingly a resolution was adopted at the meeting that the bank account be operated independently by the board secretariat and it shall submit the utilisation certificate and audited accounts to States. The resolution was taken up with the Finance departments of the governments.
