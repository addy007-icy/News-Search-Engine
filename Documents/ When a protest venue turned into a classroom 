The Deputy Commissioner’s office premises, where guest lecturers of Government First Grade Colleges are conducting an indefinite dharna demanding regularisation of their services, became the venue for classes on Thursday. The protest continued for the 19th day on Friday.On Thursday, a number of students from the Government College for Women came to the protest venue and appealed to the agitating lecturers to take classes for them.“We have been divested of classes due to the stir. Examinations are approaching and large portion of the syllabus is pending,” the students told their faculty.Without a second thought, the lecturers got a blackboard, fixed it to the compound wall and started teaching the students. Lecturers of different subjects conducted their respective classes till evening.“We have no grouse against the students. We too are concerned about their studies. Our fight is against the government. Since examinations will be held in April, we conducted the classes,” Government First Grade Colleges Guest Lecturers Union district unit president Ramanand said.This is both our responsibility and a symbol of protest, he said.There is no question of withdrawing the stir until the government agrees to regularise our services. Anyway, we are ready to conduct classes at the protest venue if students come here, he added.Guest lecturers are concerned about their future as most of them are crossing the age limit for the regular recruitments, Mr. Ramanand said.The agitating lecturers cleaned the Deputy Commissioner’s office premises a few days ago as a symbol of protest against the apathy of the government.
