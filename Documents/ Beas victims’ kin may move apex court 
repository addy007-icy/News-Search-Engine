Unabated grief has left the kin of 24 engineering students who drowned in the Beas river during a college trip disappointed with the Himachal Pradesh High Court directive that promised each of them Rs. 20-lakh compensation.Parents and next of kin might even move the Supreme Court, demanding a higher penalty for the college management, some of them told The Hindu on Sunday. In an unexpected tragedy, the engineering students of V.N.R Vignan Jyothi Engineering College, who had ventured on to the riverbed during their picnic, got washed away as the Larji power project released water from the Larji dam on June 8, 2014.The Himachal HC on June 2 had directed the State’s electricity board, management of the engineering and the State Government to share the compensation burden in the ratio 60:30:10. As per the court order the compensation amount will have to be paid to families of each of the 24 victims. Speaking to The Hindu on phone, A. Radhakrishna, father of A. Laxmi Gayatri who passed away on the day said, “We are happy that the court took the matter seriously. But it is not compensation that we want but criminal proceedings against the culprits.” . Even as the HC has reached a verdict in the case, the three parties who were asked to pay compensation are facing a case booked for “criminal negligence leading to death” filed by the parents in a district court. Mr. Radhakrishna alleged there were prior instances where students of the same college had drowned due to negligence.B. Sowmya, an M.Sc student and younger sister of B. Sandeep, who had met a tragic end in Himachal Pradesh, said, “Will the compensation bring back my brother? We want the college management to be punished for negligence”.‘We are happy that the court took the matter seriously. But it is not compensation that we want but criminal proceedings against the culprits’
