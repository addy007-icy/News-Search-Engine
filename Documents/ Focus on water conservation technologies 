The State-level 45th Research and Extension Advisory Council (REAC) meeting, conducted by Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU), was held at the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) here on Wednesday.Interacting with the participants, ANGRAU Vice-Chancellor A. Padma Raju stressed on the need for adopting water conservation technologies such as direct seeding and drip irrigation for the cultivation of paddy crop.“In the present context, we have to use our existing water resources quite judiciously. Besides, the paddy varieties developed by the university have been adopted in 12 other states in the country,” he added.Dr. Raju also appealed to the farming community to cultivate pulses on a larger area, as their support price is high and asserted that import of pulses from other countries should be reduced.
