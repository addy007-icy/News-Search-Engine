Security at the city police commissioner’s office on the busy Infantry Road has been stepped up, not due to a terror threat, but because of motorists using the premises to park their vehicles. As a result, staff and officers are forced to park outside, said a disgruntled senior police officer.On an average, around 600 vehicles belonging to the staff and senior police officers are parked in the premises at designated spots. This is in addition to vehicles of visitors and mediapersons.Off late, the inflow of vehicles has increased drastically. When security personnel began checking, they realised that many people who park their vehicles in the premises have no work in the commissioner’s office.Instead, they would be visiting restaurants or shops in the vicinity, said M.G. Nagendra Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police.In attempt to reclaim their premises from such people, the police have instructed guards to monitor the entry of vehicles.Secondly, this problem could snowball into a security issue based on which a decision to monitor the entry of vehicles was taken, Mr. Kumar said.Since Wednesday, entry of private vehicles has been restricted, even through the back gate.People who visit the commissioner office can park their vehicles on Ali Asgar Road at designated parking spots.
