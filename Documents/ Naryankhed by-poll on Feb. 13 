The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced the schedule for by-election to Narayankhed Assembly constituency in Medak District, even as the political parties in Telangana are engrossed in the ongoing process of elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), where nearly one-third of the Stateâ€™s electorate resides.As per the schedule, polling for Narayankhed by-election would be held on February 13 and the counting of votes would be taken up on February 16. The by-election has been caused due to death of sitting member P. Kishta Reddy. The former MLA died of a massive cardiac stroke on August 25 last year.Notification for the by-election would be issued on January 20 and the nominations accepted till January 27. The scrutiny of nominations would be taken up on January 28 and the last date for withdrawal of candidatures will be January 30. The EC announced that the model code of conduct would come into force with immediate effect in the district in which the Assembly constituency is going for by-election.Further, the EC stated that the by-election to Narayankhed would be held with the existing electoral roll. As per the final electoral roll published by the EC on January 17 last year, the total electorate in the constituency is 2,04,575 including 1,03,650 male, 1,00,910 female and 15 third-gender voters. The coverage of electronic photo identity cards was also 100 per cent.In spite of the Congress plea to ensure election of its candidate unopposed since the vacancy was caused by untimely death of its sitting members, as has been the tradition in the past, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has already made it clear that it would contest the election. Accordingly, the ruling party has been paying special attention on the constituency for the last four months by launching several development programmes.A triangular contest appears on cards in Narayankhed with the TRS decision to contest the by-election. It would be contest between Congress, TRS and TDP. In the 2014 election, P. Kishta Reddy defeated his nearest TRS rival M. Bhupal Reddy by a margin of 14,746 votes. The Congress candidate secured 62,347 votes out of 1,56,833 valid votes polled.
