The BJP on Thursday projected Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its Chief Ministerial candidate for the coming Assembly elections in Assam.The party’s Parliamentary Board — comprising its top leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi — took the decision at its meeting here on Thursday.The party has thus decided to project a face for the Assam elections, after its drubbing in Bihar where it tried to leverage Mr. Modi’s popularity in the polls. “I want to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah ji. I am grateful to them,” Mr. Sonowal said.Assam is crucial for the BJP, as it is the only State where the party seems to be in the fight this year.Mr. Sonowal was the party’s Assam State chief during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when it performed very well at the time of what was seen as a Modi wave in large parts of India.
