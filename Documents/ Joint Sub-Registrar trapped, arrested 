Close on the heels of Madhurwada Sub-Registrar Anand Kumar being arrested by ACB under disproportionate asset case, another Joint Sub-Registrar from the Suryabagh registration office was trapped and arrested here on Friday for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe amount of Rs. 12,000 from a complainant.Joint Sub-Registrar Pilli Pothuraju reportedly demanded a bribe of 1 per cent on the registration value from one J.S. Siva Prasad, who had purchased about 750 sq yds of land at Ramnagar.The official value of the land was about Rs. 27 lakh and the Sub-Registrar demanded Rs. 27,500 from the Mr. Siva Prasad for completing the registration formalities and delivering the document. Mr. Siva Prasad had already paid about Rs. 2 lakh in the form of stamp duty and expressed his inability to pay any further amount. The Sub-Registrar then scaled down his demand to Rs. 13,000 and finally settled for Rs. 12,000.On Friday, the accused asked the complainant to handover the money in a cover to one K. Apparao, a junior assistant in the office, who was his main contact point. The junior assistant then handed over the cover to one N. Shanmukha Rao, who works as an assistant to a document writer, for safe custody. The ACB team led by DSP K. Ramakrishna Prasad, laid the trap and arrested all the three, Pilli Pothuraju, Apparao and Shanmukha Rao.They will be produced before the ACB Special Judge on Saturday, said Mr. Ramakrishna Prasad.
