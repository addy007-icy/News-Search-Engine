Andy Murray executed his game-plan to negate the one booming weapon that Sam Groth possessed to beat the unseeded Australian 6-0 6-4 6-1 and advance to the third round of the Australian Open on Thursday.Murray had said after the first round that he knew exactly what to expect against Groth — big serve and a large frame to chip or pass at the net — and the 28-year Briton did exactly what he needed to leave his opponent scrambling from the outset.The world number two took 29 minutes to race through the first set, which included a nine-minute fourth game, and while Groth's serve found its range in the second, Murray still managed to pull out the big points when he needed.Murray continued his momentum into the third set, racing out to a 3-0 lead that he built on to set up a third round clash with Joao Sousa of Portugal.
