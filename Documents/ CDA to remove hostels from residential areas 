After last month’s order of the Orissa High Court, the Cuttack Development Authority (CDA) has initiated steps to dismantle the “illegal” students’ hostels from the residential localities of the satellite city of Abhinav Bidanasi here.“In pursuant to December 24, 2015, order of the High Court, we have issued notices to some students’ hostels running in the residential localities,” informed CDA vice-chairman Pratap Chandra Dash.He said the CDA is in the process of identifying the hostels and other commercial establishments running inside the residential localities for their removal.It is estimated that as many as 40 students’ hostels of several private professional institutions are now running in almost all the sectors of the satellite city. Housing both boys and girls, every hostel has inmates ranging between 50 and 100 students, causing immense hardship to the area residents.When several representations to the CDA authorities for removal of these hostels went unheard, advocate Patitapaban Panda, an area resident, filed a writ petition in the Orissa High Court in September last year.Mr.Panda in his petition had maintained that some unscrupulous persons by virtue of false affidavits had managed to obtain residential plots in the area and now constructing multi-storied buildings on it have rented them for hostel purposes in violation of the Orissa Municipal Corporation Act, 2003, and the Orissa Development Authority Act, 1982.Adjudicating over the petition, Justice Kumari Sanju Panda last month directed the CDA authorities to take statutory actions against the owners who have violated the terms and conditions of the approved plan within the residential area and furnish a report to the court by next date. “The matter would come up for further hearing on Thursday,” Mr. Panda informed.“Identification of hostels, commercial establishments in residential areas is on”
