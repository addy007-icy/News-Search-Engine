It rained, it pouredSo heavily and so much more.Through the day and the nightWithout a break or rest.Water! Water inside my house!Gushing and rushing with a force.Higher and faster the level roseFlooding and damaging everything it could.Upstairs we climbed to escape in rushTogether we stayed till help came.Teary-eyed we said goodbyeTo all the things we lost at home.Maithreyi Sridhar, II E, PSBB K.K.
