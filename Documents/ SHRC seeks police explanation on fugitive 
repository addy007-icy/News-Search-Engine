The State Human Rights Commission has asked the State police to come clean on the escape of Nikhil Balachandran, son of retired SP K.B. Balachandran, from the police in the city on December 27, and to clarify the doubts in the minds of the public.In a statement here, Commission chairman J.B. Koshy said directions had been issued to State Police Chief T.P. Senkumar on the same. This was in the wake of a petition submitted by Abraham Cherian, the general secretary of the Forum for Social Justice and Human Rights alleging that the police had failed in maintaining law and order and that certain people in the police force were helping antisocial elements escape from the clutches of law.
