The Kayamkulam research station of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is celebrating its centenary this year.The year-long celebrations would begin in February, ICAR-CPCRI Director P. Chowdappa said at a press conference here on Monday.Mr. Chowdappa said the CPCRI focused on research in coconut, areca nut, and cocoa. The organisation was contributing Rs.19,000 million annually to the exchequer by way of benefits accrued from improved productivity arising out of advanced research.Nineteen improved high-yielding varieties of coconut, including six hybrids, were released for various quality and quantity traits. These varieties and hybrids have the potential to yield two to six times more than the locally grown varieties in different coconut growing regions.Ten improved varieties of areca nut were released including two dwarf hybrids. In the case of cocoa, seven high-yielding varieties including three elite clones and four hybrids which yield up to 2.5 kg of dry beans per tree, were released.The CPCRI was established in 1916 as Central Coconut Research Station. It was taken over by the ICAR, which formed the CPCRI in 1970 by merging the coconut research stations in Kasaragod and Kayamkulam as well as Central Areca nut Research Station, Vittal, and five substations at Palode and Kannara in Kerala, Hirehalli in Karnataka, Mohitnagar in West Bengal, and Kahikuchi in Assam.There are two Krishi Vignan Kendras, one at Kasaragod and the other at Kayamkulam, under the CPCRI.The All India Coordinated Coconut and Arecanut Improvement Project (AICCAIP) started functioning from 1972 at the CPCRI, Kasaragod, and later renamed as All India Coordinated Research Project on Palms (AICRP) in 1986.The AICRP has 13 centres on coconut, six on oil palm, and two on palmyrah.CPCRI focuses on research in coconut, areca nut, and cocoaIt is contributing Rs.19,000 million annually to the exchequer
