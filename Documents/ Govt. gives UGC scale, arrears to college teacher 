Avoiding personal appearances of the State Higher Education department secretary and Director in the High Court on a contempt of court case, the State government has granted UGC scale of pay to a local college teacher and paid an arrear due to him for the last 13 years.This came to light on Wednesday when the High Court was informed that the government has accorded UGC scale of pay to Dr Gadadhar Rout, an economics teacher of the Christ College here.The government has also deposited an amount of Rs.16.40 lakh in the college account towards the arrears of Dr Rout.The government action came following an order passed last month by the High Court in which Justice Dr B. R. Sarangi had said that if the earlier orders of the HC in this matter are not complied with, then the two government officers shall appear in person before the Court and show cause as to why contempt of court proceedings shall not be initiated against them.Joining as a college teacher in 1997, Dr Rout was eligible to get the UGC scale from 2003. But the State government ignored his pleas following which he approached the High Court in 2011. In January last year, the HC allowed Dr Routâ€™s plea and accordingly asked the State government to take appropriate measures, informed his counsel P. K. Nanda. But when the State government failed to comply with the HC order, Dr Rout filed a contempt of court petition and obtained a favourable order in July 2015 in which the State government was asked to make the payments within two months. Even when that did not materialise, Dr Rout filed the second contempt of court petition in October last year.
