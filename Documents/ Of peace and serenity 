Is there a lot of pressure to deliver for Bengaluru’s own composer and producer Ricky Kej following his win at the Grammy Awards last year? His previous effort, Winds of Samsara, with South African flautist Wouter Kellerman won him the Best New Age Album Award. A year on, Ricky has released his new album, the similarly-titled Shanti Samsara, clocking in at about an hour.There are a lot of things that can catch your eye about this album – whether it’s the artist’s dedication to Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the inclusion of actor Amitabh Bachchan’s voice, reciting Sanskrit verses on tracks such as “Samsara” and “Shanti”, both of which are essential to introducing and closing the album. The result is a very cinematic, nearly devotional effort. That’s the kind of music that doesn’t find much favour within India – the combination of something well-produced but comes across as a devotional album at times, with Shankar Mahadevan adding his signature voice on “Ganga”.The celebratory tone of Shanti Samsara is one that Indian listeners have probably heard all too much, but Ricky can probably find more foreign ears, especially after this Grammy win. Sure, he can still conjure that sense of calm as he did on Winds of Samsara on tracks like “Vishwa”, but the touch of diversity in the album only comes toward the second half of the 14-track Shanti Samsara. Yes, he’s got collaborators such as Hariharan and Pandit Vishwa Mohan, but Ricky’s world/fusion direction yields much more – a sense of calm and serenity instead of trying to pack in as many cultural elements in four or five minutes.“Kaira” (featuring Mandinka vocals) and “Fitrat” (a wonderful combination of Peruvian guitars, vocals from Azerbaijan and Indian percussive elements) are stand-out, as is “Monks of Sherab Ling”, featuring Buddhist chants. “Compassion” features a spoken word section from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which shows how far Ricky has gone.Shanti Samsara is probably still in line with Ricky’s own goals of fusion and New Age music, though – he can combine elements from across the world like few other composers, as he proved on Winds of Samsara. This time, it’s another worthy experiment that will probably draw more foreign ears than Indians.
