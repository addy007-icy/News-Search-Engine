Sir, — Concession tickets have been introduced for senior citizens in buses run by the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). Also, four seats have been earmarked for them. However, often they are occupied by others. When senior citizens request them to get up from their seat, most of them do not oblige. At times, even the intervention of the conductor will not help.The plight of senior citizens in crowded buses is miserable.Therefore, it will be better if the BMTC runs special buses for senior citizens, at least on routes where the number of commuters is more.Hari KanniahBengaluruChannel for musicSir, — It is good to know that AIR will start a 24x7 channel for classical music. AIR should broadcast this service on FM channels too like the 100.1FM channel of Bengaluru so that the connoisseurs of music need not have to switch on the TV to listen to music. Doordarshan should also start a channel for classical music too.K.V. PathyBengaluruRainwater harvestingSir, — The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) decision to make installation of rainwater harvesting systems in houses and apartments compulsory is a welcome move. However, punitive actions such as levying fines and stopping the water supply to those who have not installed the systems appear to be draconian. The BBMP should help people to set up the system either directly or thorough recognised private organisations. The BBMP should suggest alternative methods for those who may not be in a position to install rainwater harvesting systems.D.B.N. MurthyBengaluruReaders can email to letters.bangalore@thehindu.co.in
