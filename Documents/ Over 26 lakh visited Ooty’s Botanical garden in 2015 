According to statistics available with the Horticulture Department, as many as 26,15,768 tourists visited Ooty’s Government Botanical Garden this year. This is more than the 21,36,867 tourists who visited the garden in 2014. Interestingly, flow of tourists was more in all the 12 months compared to the previous year.These figures are derived from the tickets sold to visitors to the 55-acre garden.District Collector P. Shankar attributed the reason for the increase to change in attitude of the people. “Ooty is no more a summer tourist destination,” he said. Earlier tourist flow dipped from July to September before picking up moderately for the winter season till December and early January.The collector observed that a major section of tourists avoided Ooty during the extremely cold winter and rainy season. “But in 2015 we saw an increase in tourists coming here to enjoy the extreme climates too,” he said. Long weekends clubbed with other holidays were a factor for more visitors as was the fact that the impact of the South West and North East monsoons was not that great. Joint Director of Horticulture N. Mani said that 60 per cent of tourists were from Kerala and Karnataka. “The rest are from Tamil Nadu, North India and abroad,” he said. He added that the department and district administration were trying to introduce more tourist attractions in the garden this year. There was also an increase in eco tourism to Avalanche and a few other places in the forest areas of the Nilgiris. The Tea Park near Doddabetta with a lawn and a view pint was also an added draw in 2015.
