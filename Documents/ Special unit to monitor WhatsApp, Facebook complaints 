With a view to ensure quick response, the Warangal City Police Commissionerate had set up a special unit to monitor complaints received via WhatsApp and Facebook.Commissioner G Sudheer Babu has been interacting with colony residents associations motivating them to install closed circuit televisions as a deterrent to burglaries and check anti-social elements on prowl during nights.Speaking to The Hindu , Mr Sudheer Babu said the crime rate had come down in colonies such as Ashoka Colony where the residents installed CCTVs. He appealed to residents of other colonies to follow suit for safety. In metro cities, many colonies have CCTVs and it is time people here adopt methods as this is the fast growing place.According to him, chain snatchings are under control since they launched the WhatsApp facility. “We are also planning to launch an Android application for the benefit of women to reach police in times of distress,” he explained. Till now in the tri-cities, eight colonies have volunteered to set up CCTV cameras in their localities. They were assisted by the police in placement of the cameras and the cameras can be monitored from the nearest police station.Mr Sudheer Babu said the crime rate in these areas came down completely and he declared these areas as safe colonies. “We are getting good results in the areas where these CCTV cameras were installed,” he said.Colony residents also say that after installing the CCTV cameras in their colonies, they have developed a sense of security for themselves. “There was sense of fear previously and there were many burglaries and chain snatching incidents in our colony. Now we feel safe,” said J. Rajitha, a resident of Ashoka Colony.
