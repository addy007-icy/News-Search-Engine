: From living rooms to social media, all Delhiites can talk about these days is “odd-even” and how the government’s road-rationing experiment has affected life.With the 15-day initiative coming to an end on Friday, thousands have signed online petitions that either want the scheme to be extended or to be scrapped altogether. So far, it seems that the ayes have it.“Citizens have started several petitions on Change.org strongly arguing for and against the odd-even formula. Going by the support the petitions have drawn, the trend seems to be clearly in favour of continuing the odd-even scheme in Delhi,” said Preethi Herman, the country lead of Change.org.Of the handful of petitions on Change.org, the one to get the most support is asking for the odd-even experiment to be extended.Started on January 5, the petition titled ‘Let The Capital Of India Breathe (let the odd-even continue beyond 15 days)’ had about 6,500 signatures as of Monday evening.Dwarka resident Vivek Raj, who started the petition, said Delhiites had come out in support of the initiative and his campaign, despite the inconvenience of switching from private to shared or public transport.“We need to have a positive mindset. Change will happen only when we are open to an opportunity. I’m quite happy with the support the petition is getting,” said Mr. Raj, who himself has started cycling from his home in Dwarka Sector-7 to his workplace in Dwarka Mor.Another petition, started by Bangalore-based Sriram Iyer, asks the government to “drop the ineffective odd-even rule and implement other more effective measures”. The petition had been signed by around 2,600 people as of Monday evening. Mr. Iyer said that with people taking auto-rickshaws, two-wheelers and cabs instead of private cars the emissions from vehicles will not go down.The petition suggests that the government should improve emission standards and enforcement, levying taxes on emission levels from vehicles and industries, and impose congestion charges.
