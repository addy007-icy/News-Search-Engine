Puthiya Tamilagam party founder K. Krishnasamy claimed that the panel from Union Government assessing impact of the flood in Chennai and in the nearby northern districts has ignored the Southern districts that were also affected by the recent heavy rain and flood.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the Dr. Krishnasamy said that a panel deputed by the Union Government is conducting the second assessment of impact of the flood in Chennai, Cuddalore, Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur.“Tuticorin, Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli were also flood affected during the heavy rain. Many have lost their belongings at Ottapidaram, Srivaikundam, Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam taluks due to flooding of rivers,” Dr. Krishnasamy said and added that they too need relief from the government.He made an appeal to the State Government to draw the attention of the Union Government’s committee to such regions in the southern districts to carry out an assessment and extend government benefits. Dr. Krishnasamy also urged the State Government to carry out the drives against encroachments at water bodies in Chennai.
