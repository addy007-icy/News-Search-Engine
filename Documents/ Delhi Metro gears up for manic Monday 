: While the first day of the odd-even plan didn’t result in much additional rush in its trains and Saturday saw even less passengers, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is all geared up for Monday, which might prove to be the real test for the car-rationing formula.The DMRC had already put in place a schedule to run trains to full capacity but had reduced the number of planned train trips after fewer commuters were anticipated on Friday. There was no significant spike in its ridership figures on Saturday either. Sources, however, said that DMRC expects Monday to be challenging as it usually is the busiest day of the week.To facilitate traffic with the odd-even plan in force, the DMRC has made plans to make 3,192 train trips a day, compared to the 2,827 trips made during the same period last year.The Delhi Metro will press 198 trains into service from Monday. A DMRC spokesperson said that this was the maximum number of trains that could be run while keeping only the essential maintenance reserve.The DMRC has already deployed additional shifts of guards and Customer Facilitation Agents at all the major Metro stations to help and guide commuters. “Additional manpower will be deployed to handle the increased load on the ticketing system,” the spokesperson said.The DMRC said that lines and stations will be monitored by the control room and action will be taken to ensure that a crowd is not built up at booking points, TVMs and security frisking points. The Delhi Metro has also augmented the manpower handling its helpline number 155370, to attend to the expected rise in number of calls.The highest number of footfalls that the DMRC has ever seen was in August 28, 2015 when more than 32 lakhs had travelled in its operational fleet of 196 trains.
