: The Opposition parties are not convinced with the Central government’s claim that the crop insurance scheme cleared by it on Wednesday, will alleviate the plight of farmers. They said the new scheme appeared to be different from previous ones but the only thing that might benefit the farmers is bearing a large part of the premium burden by the Central and State governments.TDP farmers’ wing leader Chalasani Anjaneyulu said it was only a rehash of the previous versions of the crop insurance scheme. It would not be beneficial to the debt-ridden farmers unless survey numbers are taken as the basis for enumerating the loss.“Only insurance companies will make business but the farmers will be left in the lurch if a village/mandal is taken as the unit. We are preparing to meet the Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh soon.” CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna said the scheme contained nothing significant for the farmers except a reduction in premium and new methods of calculation of loss.CPI (M) State secretary P. Madhu asked: “ What is the use of making some changes in the crop insurance scheme when farmers are suffering a major injustice in extension of institutional credit and other measures ought to be taken to alleviate their plight?”.PCC spokesman Kolanukonda Sivaji said there were disparities in the criteria stipulated for different crops.
