The individuals and NGOs should supplement the efforts of the government and strive to bring in change in the society, said District Collector Vakati Karuna.Felicitating the individuals who received national award by the Dalita Sahitya Academy of New Delhi, the Collector congratulated them and urged them to continue their good work. Each employee should be an example to others in the society.She lauded the work of the Academy district president M. Jitendar and said he secured a name for himself by recognising the merit in others located far away in rural areas. One should emulate Mr. Jitendar by undertaking similar work.“It is really tough to take time out for others. Being a constable, he is able to spare his time for others, especially encouraging children in rural government schools,” she said appreciating the efforts of Mr Jitendar.About 40 people working in various government departments and in private institutions were given away mementos by the District Collector at the conference hall on Friday evening.Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Jitendar said one should live for others in society. Many people wish to do something good after retirement, which is not correct. When a person is young and able, he or she should justify his existence by helping the needy. The Academy will strive to recognise merit in others and also felicitate those working sincerely only to inspire others and thus build a better society.About 40 persons working in various government departments and private institutions receive mementos by District Collector
