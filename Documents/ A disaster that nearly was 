If there is one lesson from the recent floods, it probably is not to obstruct the path of a water course. If the State government goes ahead with its planned satellite township at Tirumazhisai, it will come up in the path of a furious rain run-off zone, putting not only the town in danger, but also Chennai, just over 30 km away.Going by the map sourced from the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, the township sits literally in the mouth of the Chembarambakkam reservoir, one of the key water bodies supplying drinking water to the city.It is also poised at the cusp of water run-off courses from nearly 22 water bodies in the north of Chennai draining into the reservoir, and the Nemam reservoir.Days after the floodwaters receded from the rest of the areas in the city, the entire zone was under a sheet of water, indicating the reality of the water run-off and the great danger it poses to the region it sits on during high floods. Among the first few announcements when the AIADMK government came to power in 2011, it said about 300-odd acres at Tirumazhisai had been acquired to be developed into a township. Chief Minister made a suo motu statement in the Assembly: the Rs. 2,160-crore satellite township would come up on 311.05 acres owned by the TNHB. It would include Chembarambakkam, Kuthambakkam, Parvatharajapuram, Narasingapuram and Vellavedu.
