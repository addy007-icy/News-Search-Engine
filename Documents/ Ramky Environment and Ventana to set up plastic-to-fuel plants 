Waste to energy company Ventana and waste management services firm Ramky Environment have joined hands to set up multiple plastic-to-fuel plants in the country, including one in Hyderabad. Announcing the partnership, a Ventana statement said in the first phase the companies would work together to establish a 15 tonnes per day plant at Ramky’s integrated solid waste management site in Hyderabad. Both partners would co-invest in the project. In phase–II, multiple plants to convert the over 400 tonnes of low-grade waste plastics received by Ramky at the Hyderabad municipal site every day would be established. The firms also plan to set up such plants at different locations in India and thus “convert waste plastics to high economic value industrial fuels.”World over almost two-thirds of waste plastics are dumped at landfills for lack of a recycling solution. Ventana, according to its CEO Amit Tandon, has developed a depolymerization engine that accepts low-grade plastics and converts them to high value industrial fuels similar to diesel.Ramky Environment managing director and CEO Goutham Reddy said the company received several hundred tonnes of non-recyclable waste plastics , daily at its waste management operations in India.
