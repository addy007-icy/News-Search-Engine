On the last day of the Odd-Even scheme, Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, thanked the people, media and judiciary for 'successful' implementation of the scheme. He claimed that air pollution levels came down and urged people to continue following the scheme voluntarily.“World watched the success of odd-even experiment,” he said. “We imposed a strict rule but the people of Delhi followed it on their own.”Overwhelmed with the response, Mr Kejriwal also invited people at Chhatrasal Stadium on Sunday to celebrate the success of the traffic regulation scheme. “It is a question of our health, our children’s health, our city,” he said in a press conference on Friday.Giving details of the 15-day scheme, Transport minister, Gopal Rai, said, 9,144 challans were issued in total and the efficiency of buses have gone up as they could increase their daily trips because of less congestion on the roads. “Earlier, buses would cover only 160kms on an average but now they were able to cover 200kms daily. That's why they were less crowded.”The Delhi government came up with such a radical scheme after High Court had said Delhi had turned into gas chamber. Mr. Kejriwal thanked Supreme Court judges who used carpool to follow the odd-even scheme despite exemption.He also added that drastic reduction in traffic congestion on road due to the scheme was surprising. “People started saying that they had begun to car pool and were spending far less time on the roads. It looked as if Delhi’s roads had been cleared of traffic congestion.”
