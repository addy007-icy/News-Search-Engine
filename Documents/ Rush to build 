The Bidadi Integrated Township and Satellite Township Ring Road projects, which is receiving a push after nearly one decade, could be possibly used as marquee projects by the Congress government in the State.As per the present norms in Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961, a Town Planning Scheme takes 43 months to procure land for the project. But in a bid to complete the two projects, the government is set to amend key provisions to commission them in its remaining period of 24 months.The Gujarat government had brought in amendments to reduce the duration from 43 months to 27 months before it embarked on the Sardar Patel Ring Road in Ahmedabad in 2003.As per the Town Planning Scheme, the local planning authority needs to announce its intent and later notify a draft scheme, allow time for objections and notify a final scheme after which the government will have deemed possession of all land part of the scheme without any encumbrances.However, there is a hitch.“There is a misconception that the Town Planning Scheme is voluntary. Actually, the government reserves the right to acquire and take possession of land. The only way it differs is with regard to the compensation,” a senior BMRDA official said. Land-losers unwilling to take a part of the developed land can opt for cash compensation.However, he was quick to add that they would be convinced of the benefits of the scheme.Monthly pension for land-losersThose who give up land for the Bidadi Integrated Township and STRR will get a monthly pension in the intervening period of land being taken over and re-allotment of a part of the developed land. This provision will be incorporated in Karnataka Town and Country Planning Act, 1961.The cash pension package will be calculated based on the extent and value of land taken over for the project. A senior official said that the income the land owning family earns from the land (agricultural) will be considered to arrive at the package. Sources said that the package will in no way affect the final calculation of extent of developed land to be re-allotted to the landowner.Local leader at the forefrontThe State government is expected to notify a Local Planning Authority for Bidadi and STRR by February-end that will be headed by a local leader.The government had in 2006 notified 10,000 acres of Bidadi as a town and deleted the area from all planning areas. The proposed Bidadi LPA will come as a huge relief for the landowners.“We need a credible face in the locality to be the public face of the project, convince farmers to part with land for the project,” an official said. While there are calls to put an industry face to lead the project, the government seems to favour a political leader, sources said.There was a proposal for a Bidadi LPA covering 28 villages in Bidadi, but excluding the 10,000 acres of the proposed Bidadi township. The new LPA will include the township as well.GFXBidadi Integrated TownshipOctober 2006: Cabinet clears projectOctober 2007: DLF given development rightsMay 2009: DLF walks outDecember 2015: BMRDA decides to revive project under Town Planning SchemeImpact on areaIn 2006, government notified 9,178 acres spread across 10 villagesThis effectively deleted this area from all further planningFroze land-use conversionBreak upgovernment land: 2,198 acresprivate land: 6,336 acresWater bodies: 644 acresVillages: Aralalasandra, Byramangala, Bannigiri, Hosur, K.G.
