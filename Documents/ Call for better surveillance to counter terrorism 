“Religious fanaticism, extremism and terrorism are the biggest threats facing world nations today. It is also a fact that Muslims constitute a majority of the victims of terrorism committed in the name of Islam,” says John Cox, former Secretary General of the World Psychiatric Association and former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London.Prof. Cox told The Hindu on the sidelines of a programme at Thiruvalla on Thursday that the so-called Islamic State or ISIS had no relation to Islam, which always upheld peace, love and fraternity.In many cases, he said, the terrorists were found to be young people driven by a lust for adventure, criminal and violent inclinations, emotional and psychological imbalances. Prof. Cox said religion was only a part of most terrorist attacks.He said most world leaders were at pains not to identify the terrorists as Islamic and to highlight the peacefulness of Muslims.“To reduce terror, we have to focus exclusively on reducing the terrorists’ opportunities to act by increasing surveillance and coercion. World leaders are strongly engaged in developing counter-terrorism responses to protect their citizens in the backdrop of terror attacks in different parts of the globe.” He said psychology could contribute some important research-based perspectives on group conflicts and dispute resolution to prevent young people from pursuing the path of terrorism.
