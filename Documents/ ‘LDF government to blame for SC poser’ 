The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) will implead in the case when the State government files a fresh affidavit as directed by the Supreme Court in the matter challenging denial of entry for women in the age group of 10 to 50 years to the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala.Talking to The Hindu, TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan said the abrupt or rather confusing affidavit filed by the previous Left Democratic Front Government might have naturally confused the judiciary.“ The affidavit filed by a government comprising MLAs who even preferred to take their oath of office not in the name of God has failed to properly apprise the court about the custom and practice at Sabarimala where devotees, cutting across religious barriers, congregate on their annual pilgrimage,” he said.
