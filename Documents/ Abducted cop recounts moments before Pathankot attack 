Gurdaspur SP Salwinder Singh, whose vehicle was forcibly taken away by heavily-armed militants, on Tuesday, said he was blindfolded and the terrorists took two of his three mobiles and fled with his vehicle.“We were blindfolded, our hands tied behind our backs and the terrorists numbering four-five threatened to kill us if we tried to look up,” he said.Armed with AK-47 rifles, the terrorists initially had no clue that he was a police officer. It was only when the terrorists picked up his mobile that they realised the person they had caught was a senior officer, Mr. Singh said.“They came back to kill me but by then I had freed my hands and moved from the spot,” he said.Asked why he was in civilian clothes and did not have his gunman with him, Mr. Singh said he was returning after offering prayers at the ‘Pir Baba’ and that was the reason he chose not to take the police escort.“ Light band karo,” ordered one of the terrorist while another asked us to kneel down. “If you look up, we will shoot you on the spot.”Mr. Singh recounted and said that the terrorists spoke in Urdu, Punjabi and also Hindi.Since it was dark we could ascertain the exact number of terrorists but it looked like about four to five, he said.Mr. Singh said the terrorists had stopped his vehicle when he along with his jeweller friend Rajesh Verma and cook Madan Gopal were returning after paying obeisance at Narot Jaimal Singh in the wee hours of Friday.“They were carrying AK 47 and GPS,” he said.“We were dumped along with my cook. …when they came to know that I was a SP then they told Rajesh that you have deceived us and you will have to face consequences,” he said.
