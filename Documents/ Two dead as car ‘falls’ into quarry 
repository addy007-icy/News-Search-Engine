In a suspected case of suicide, a man, Venu, 51, of Ayanimoodu, and his 21-year-old son Akhil, were killed after the car they were travelling in fell into the water in an abandoned quarry at Chittikkara, near Pothencode, here on Tuesday.‘Motor occurrence’ caseAccording to the police, who have registered a ‘motor occurrence’ case based on a complaint lodged by relatives, the incident occurred around 6.40 a.m., with a homemaker standing on her terrace seeing the Maruti Alto car (KL 01 AV 9004) going down the gravel road that runs alongside the quarry before swerving and crashing into the water, around 200 ft below the ground.The police, along with Fire and Rescue Services personnel, managed to retrieve the body of Akhil around 9 a.m., while the body of Venu, a senior employee with the State Lotteries Department, was retrieved after a search that took over six hours.The bodies were shifted to Government Medical College Hospital, from where they were handed over to relatives, including Venu’s wife Geetha and younger son Amal, after autopsy.The funerals were conducted around 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday.‘Slow-moving vehicle’Earlier, according to information pieced together by the Pothencode police, Venu had reached his brother’s house at Chittikara early in the morning to pick up Akhil, who was staying there since last night, and had taken the quarry road, which leads to the house of a relative.However, how the car which, according to the eye-witness, was moving ‘slowly and silently’ along the curve before the quarry ended up crashing into the water remains a mystery.The police do not rule out the possibility of an accident, and at the same time, are investigating reports of a few phone calls that Venu received last night in connection with an alleged relationship Akhil had with a girl. Venu’s nephew, with whom Akhil was staying last night, told the police that Akhil was in the backseat with Venu driving the car. The police also have found that Venu left photographs of himself and his son on a table in their home before setting out on what turned out to be his last journey.Relatives and neighbours, recalling Venu to be a very polite person and respected by everyone, said Akhil had secured a job with a firm in Technopark only a week ago. There were no known financial issues or other disputes.
