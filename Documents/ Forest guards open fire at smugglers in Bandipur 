Forest guards opened fire on a gang of timber smugglers in Maliyur range of Bandipur Tiger Reserve area on Sunday evening injuring one of them.The guards opened fire when they were allegedly attacked with sickles and saws by a gang of eight smugglers. One of the smugglers, who suffered a bullet injury in the leg, is undergoing treatment at the K.R. Hospital in Mysuru.Maliyur range Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) G. Venkatesh told The Hindu that the smugglers felled teak trees in the forests before cutting them into logs, weighing 40 to 50 kg each, for being ferried as head loads. The personnel from Hurulipura Anti Poaching Camp, who were carrying out routine combing operations, heard sounds and became alert.“Initially, they thought it was a herd of elephants. But, soon they saw the smugglers, who were trying to hide themselves”. As the guards approached them, they abandoned the logs and fled. “When our personnel chased them, they turned around and attacked them with sickles and saws,” he said.The forest department personnel fired at their legs in self-defence. While the smugglers managed to escape, Channanayaka, a resident of Basapura in H.D. Kote taluk of Mysuru district, suffered a bullet injury. He was initially taken to the Government Hospital in H.D. Kote and was later shifted to K.R. Hospital in Mysuru.The forest department has seized the abandoned teak logs. As anti-social elements from villages, including Basapura on the outskirts of the tiger reserve, are notorious for timber smuggling, the forest officials said combing operations will be intensified.
