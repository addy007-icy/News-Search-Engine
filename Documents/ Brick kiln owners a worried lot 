Brick kiln owners in the district, who have employed over 5,000 migrant labourers from Odisha, are a worried lot over the abrupt closure of kilns as over hundred labourers were sent back to their native places by the district authorities on Saturday.Last month, the district authorities rescued over 70 migrant labourers working in SVG Bricks in Hanumanthunipeta village of Peddapalli mandal following the death of a migrant pregnant woman under suspicious circumstances.The labourers were sent back to their native villages in Odisha.Now, the officials have sent back all the 146 migrant labourers working in a brick kiln in Rangapur village of the same mandal following a protest by the labourers, who alleged that the kiln owner had thrashed a fellow employee for consuming liquor.Following the instructions of the district authorities, the 200-odd brick kiln owners have provided all the amenities for the migrant labourers at the work site - proper accommodation, toilets, water, power etc.But the migrant workers reportedly kept causing trouble in the functioning of kilns by lodging false complaints with the district authorities at the behest some organisations, allege the brick kiln owners.“We are providing all amenities and wages as per labour laws. But why forcibly take away all the labourers and close down the kiln when only one particular labourer is creating problem? If there is any fault with the kiln owner, the authorities should constitute a fact-finding committee and inquire into the allegations, but it should not completely close the kiln and cause losses,” say the brick kiln owners.Varaprasad of VBC bricks say: We are protecting the environment from pollution by using the bottom ash of NTPC and burnt husk (black) of the rice mills to produce eco-friendly clay bricks.But, we do not have protection from the government and we are unnecessarily targeted for no fault, following the false allegations.He said that the authorities should also listen to the problems of the kiln owners before taking any harsh decision on closing down the units, particularly after making huge investments.
