Operation of city bus services for the benefit of the commuters remains a mirage in Karimnagar town for the past several years in spite of sanction of buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewable Mission (JNNURM) programme of the Union government.The then Congress Central government, following the initiatives taken by former Member of Parliament Ponnam Prabhakar, sanctioned 70 buses under JNNURM programme to the district in 2013. Out of the sanctioned buses, 50 were allocated to Karimnagar municipality and 20 for Ramagundam municipality. As part of the programme, it was decided to construct an exclusive city bus station at RTC workshop on Jagtial road in Karimnagar town.Since then, people of Karimnagar town, who were deprived of public transport system, were eagerly waiting to avail the facilities to reach various destinations in the town and also the outskirts, where there is a proliferation of higher educational institutions and other government offices.Every time, the RTC authorities would announce that they would launch the city bus services in Karimnagar town very soon -- but all in vain.Now, around eight JNNURM buses have arrived in Karimnagar town, but they were confined to the depots.JNNURM buses are specially designed and fitted with Intelligent Transport System (ITS) to monitor their movement. Every bus is fitted with radio frequency antenna, which helps to track the movement of the bus and its arrival time etc, which can be displayed at the bus stops, the RTC sources said. Sources said that they had not received orders for the operation of city bus services by using JNNURM buses. “With the non-completion of R&B roads and no bus stops in the town, it would not be advisable to operate city buses when the RTC is already facing stiff competition from autos and other private operators,” they added.
