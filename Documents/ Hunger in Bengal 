One cannot help but be moved by reports on the plight of the tea worker in West Bengal. It is shocking that in modern India, one still comes across examples of grinding poverty, and with no solution in sight (Editorial, Dec.29). There needs to be a comprehensive study on why Indian tea is not selling especially when it is in demand in many parts of the world. Moves to help tea workers must be stepped up with all their basic needs being met. There needs to be a government cash dole and the opening of primary health centres near tea estates to ensure worker well-being. Can they be allocated work under a scheme like MGNREGA?G. Purushothaman,TirunelveliTaking refuge behind reasons such as climate change and economic conditions show that West Bengal is not interested in extending much-wanted relief to the tea workers. Cash-rich tea firms must extend food security to their predominantly female workforce. It is odd that womenâ€™s activists are not fighting for their rights.Mehaboob T.,Hyderabad
