: Cellular operators have described the new regulation of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) asking them to pay compensation for call drops experienced on their networks as its “knee-jerk reaction”. The rule would penalise them without any proof of deficiency in service, they contended before the Delhi High Court on Monday.Appearing for the telecom companies which have challenged TRAI's October 16, 2015 regulation, senior advocate Harish Salve said the new rule was arbitrary, as the cellphone service providers were already required to maintain 90 per cent coverage with the exemption for two per cent call drops.Mr. Salve said only an order, rather than a regulation, could make changes in the tariff structure, which would be disturbed if the telecom operators were required to pay compensation to the consumers.He said the cellular operators were not violating the licence conditions.The senior counsel said the telecom operators across the country had a consumer base of one billion, while 36 per cent of call drops were due to irregular use by consumers.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who also appeared for the operators, said that fewer number of mobile towers was responsible for call drops, but they are unable to install more, as permissions from several authorities were needed to set up even a single tower.A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, which was hearing the arguments, posted the case for further hearing on Tuesday, when the TRAI is likely to begin its arguments defending its decision.The writ petition has been moved by the Cellular Operators Association of India, Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India and 21 telecom operators, challenging TRAI's regulation mandating the cellular service operators to pay consumers Re.1 per call drop experienced on their networks, subject to a cap of Rs.3 a day.
