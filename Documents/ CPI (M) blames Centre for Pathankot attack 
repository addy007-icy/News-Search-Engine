The Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the Centre for the terror attacks on the Pathankot airbase in Punjab and said that the incident has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of a “robust government” in question.Addressing the gathering at the 50th anniversary of CPI (M) mouthpiece Ganashakti on Sunday, Mr. Yechury pointed out that despite the Union Government’s claim on Saturday that all the terrorists at the airbase had been eliminated it was later known that two more terrorists are inside it.“Mr. Modi is claiming that the discussions with Pakistan have resumed. Then why such attacks are still taking place and who is responsible for this?” asked Mr. Yechury. He also said that it the “weak points with the security and intelligence” and adequate measures must be taken in this regard.
