The number of visitors thronging Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary has gone up 250 per cent during calendar year 2015 compared to the previous year, thanks largely to the improved amenities for visitors and re-starting of boating and trekking facilities.An official of the Department of Forests said the number of visitors had steadily gone up from 2013 during which around 36,000 visitors were recorded. The number went up to around 73,000 during 2014.The opening of a butterfly park and a ‘Nakshatra Vanam’ has added to the attractions of the bird sanctuary, spread over 25.16 sq.km. The boating facility and the trekking packages are also attracting visitors, said the official.Look out for the great-eared nightjarMeanwhile, the sighting of a great-eared nightjar last weekend close to the sanctuary is sure to boost the number of visitors.Girish Chandran, a legal practitioner, who photographed the bird during the day, said that he had never seen the bird so clear and close in 14 years as a birder. It was found sitting on a tree, he said trying barely to conceal his excitement.Usually the great-eared nightjar, with its feathers having the colour of dead leaves, is hard to spot in the forests though their calls can be clearly heard over long distances at night, said R. Sugathan, ornithologist at the bird sanctuary about the night bird.
