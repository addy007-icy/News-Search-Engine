Members of Indian Railways Technical Supervisors Association staged a demonstration in the city last week in support of their demands, including the need for a higher pay scale that has been ignored by the seventh Central Pay Commission.They said the higher recruitment qualifications, training, job requirements, nature of their work and increase in responsibilities due to modernisation and introduction of high-speed trains were not considered. The members, working as Junior Engineer and Senior Section Engineer, denied that the governmentâ€™s expense on account of pay, allowances and pension will increase by 23.55 per cent and said the real increase will be only 12.55 per cent, a press release said.
