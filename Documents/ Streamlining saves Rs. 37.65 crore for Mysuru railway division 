Cost-cutting measures and streamlining the administration has helped save Mysuru Division of the South Western Railway nearly Rs. 37.65 crore this year.Divisional Railway Manager Rajkumar Lal announced this while addressing the railway staff during the Republic Day celebrations here on Tuesday. He said owing to rigorous efforts of the Accounts Department, bills recoverable to the tune of Rs. 3.92 crore were realised; this along with system improvement methods led to saving Rs. 37.65 crore.Besides, the Electrical Department took steps to conserve electricity at stations, colonies and on station premises by providing energy-efficient gadgets. They also provided solar lights at level-crossings and the department was now planning to develop hybrid power plants at select stations, said Mr. Lal.On the safety front, the division achieved zero unmanned railway level-crossing accident or incident in the last 18 months and Mr. Lal attributed it to the continuing efforts to create public awareness, launching ‘Gate Mitra’ schemes at 70 level-crossings and provision of warning boards at 164 unmanned level-crossings in the division.In all, 25 level-crossing gates were eliminated by construction of low-height subway and manning the gates; eight unmanned level-crossings were manned while speed restrictions owing to poor visibility were relaxed at six locations. Additional loop line with new station building had been constructed at Bageshpura and this had helped the division remove operational snags and enhance the speed, said Mr. Lal.Additional Divisional Railway Manager P. Ram and Senior Divisional Commercial Manager K. Anil Kumar were among those present.AchievementsSolar-powered lights provided at level-crossingsThere are plans to develop hybrid power plants at select stationsDivision achieved zero unmanned railway level-crossing accident or incident in the last 18 months25 level-crossing gates eliminated in the division
