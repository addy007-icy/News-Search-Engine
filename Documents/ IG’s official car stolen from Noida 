The official vehicle of an Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Inspector General in the Capital was stolen from outside his residence in Noida’s Sector-23 early on Wednesday morning.Just days before the Republic Day, the incident raised security concerns at a time when police forces across the National Capital Region are already on high alert. The authorities are especially concerned keeping in mind what happened before the attack on the Pathankot air base on January 2, when terrorists hijacked the official car of Superintendent of Police Salwinder Singh.Though an alert has been sounded by Noida Police, they are investigating the incident as a ‘simple’ theft. The white Tata Safari Dicor, with a blue beacon, was stolen at 3.48 a.m. from outside IPS officer Anand Swaroop’s house.“An FIR for theft has been registered at the Sector-24 police station and we have informed bordering districts,” said Gautam Budh Nagar Senior Superintendent of Police Kiran S.The brand new car, which bears the registration number CH01GA2915, had troubles with its ignition near the officer’s workplace at the CGO Complex in Delhi on January 17, when it was towed away to a service station in Okhla, said Deputy Superintendent of Police Anoop Singh.“The car was returned from the service centre on Tuesday, and was stolen early on Wednesday, so we are looking at the possibility of the key being duplicated at the centre,” said Mr. Singh.The footage from CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood as well as two guards, posted outside a GAIL complex opposite the IG’s house, are being examined, said Mr. Singh. He added that five employees of the service station and the IG’s driver are also being questioned. Security at the entry and exit points of Noida has also been increased.The IG, who is a 1992 batch IPS officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre, had been posted with the ITBP on deputation last year.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police reacted urgently to the theft by alerting its personnel across the Capital. Traffic policemen out on the roads have been provided the description of the stolen vehicle in case they happen to spot it on Delhi roads.“All Delhi Police units have been alerted and senior officers of each district have been instructed to deploy some policemen to conduct searches,” said a senior police officer.The Delhi Police is also using social media, Twitter in particular, to reach out to the general public and media houses for help.Sharing the registration number of the vehicle, the Delhi Police Twitter handle has asked people to call 100 or 0120-2479001 if they spot the vehicle in Delhi and Noida respectively.Police are worried as vehicles with beacons have been used in the past to gain easy access to a target and carry out terror attacks, including the Parliament and Pathankot attacks.
