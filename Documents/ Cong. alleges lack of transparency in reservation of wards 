Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Friday described the process of reservation of wards in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation as one that completely lacked transparency.He demanded a re-look at the process to ensure that certain sections like the Scheduled Castes and Tribes got their due share of the 150 wards in tune with their population, so that they can contest in the elections.He slammed the ruling TRS for giving only 10 and two seats to the SCs and STs respectively and that in wards where their population was not significant enough to justify the reservation.He said the ruling party leaders appeared to be thinking that they could bulldoze their way through over the Opposition and warned them that people were watching and would teach them a lesson in the elections.Responding to a question about the ongoing development works like the Metro Rail, he said the only way the ruling party appeared to be connected to the massive, public transport project was that they had already started using all the pillars to put up ‘flexi’ banners with photographs of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS leaders, as part of the election campaign.Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the party was already in the campaign mode and while senior leaders were conducting meetings in all the 24 Assembly constituencies of the GHMC, aspirants at the ward level were going around meeting voters.
