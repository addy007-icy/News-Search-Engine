Airports Authority of India has suggested to Madurai district administration to construct a subway on the Inner Ring Road near Madurai airport to avoid re-routing of Uthangudi-Kappalur Road for the proposed extension of airport runway.The members of Madurai Airport Advisory Committee were informed of this by Airport Director Kuldeep Singh Rishi at a recent meeting.“We have made the suggestion to Collector L. Subramanian… While the airport runway could be extended on the eastern side cutting the Ring Road, vehicles can be allowed below it through the subway,” he said.This would save the district administration the difficulty of re-routing the Ring Road and acquiring land for it, he said.However, Mr. Rishi had a word of caution that the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had rejected one such proposal made for Visakhapattinam airport.But, one more such proposal for Varanasi airport was still pending.Mr. Rishi said that Madurai airport was waiting for the outcome of Varanasi airport proposal for processing its (Madurai airport) proposal, he said.If the subway proposal is approved by the BCAS, it will save the State government the efforts it has to take in acquiring some 94 acres of land for re-routing of the Ring Road from Mandela Nagar junction.The delay in land acquisition for re-routing of the Ring Road is also one of the reasons for not completing the process of acquiring 615 acres for the airport expansion works.
