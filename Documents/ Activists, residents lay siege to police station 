A large number of residents including the activists of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam and other outfits took out a rally and attempted to lay siege to the Ariyankuppam police station alleging that the police had failed to take action against the illegal sale of narcotic substance and lottery in the jurisdiction.Tension prevailed as the police prevented the activists from laying siege to the police station.Over 500 of them were taken into custody when they neared the barricade on Cuddalore Road and later released in the afternoon.Raising slogans against the police for allegedly being ineffective in handling serious crimes in the area, they claimed that as a result the public, especially women, were unable to move around freely in Ariyankuppam, which had turned into a den of crime and vice.The activists also brandished a few packets of ganja and banned lotteries as proof of their claims.Logu. Ayyappan, of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam said the illegal sale of ganja was brazenly done in several areas with the knowledge of police and innocent adolescent students and youth are forced into crime.Even as the sale of lottery was banned in several states including Tamil Nadu, the lottery business has been thriving.The police officers have been ineffective and failed to take any action against the crimes.Police officials rebutted these allegations and claimed that no complaint had been lodged in this regard.They said the local police are not empowered to handle the cases relating to illegal sale and possession of ganja and the illegal lottery sale.
