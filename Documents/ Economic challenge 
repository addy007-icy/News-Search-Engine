This is with reference to the article “ >Improve the investment climate” (Jan.12). If we want greater foreign investment and better creation of jobs, we need to ensure that we create a friendly environment. One of the main reasons for the underdevelopment of our economy is our failure to invest in infrastructure development. Investment-friendly policies that remove the regulatory bottlenecks will help generate investment for the sector.Another cause for our poor economic growth is that most of the economic decisions are taken with political objectives. Hence, enormous amounts are spent on subsidies and freebies instead of long-term investments like setting up of large industries and providing health facilities.Veena Shenoy,Thane
