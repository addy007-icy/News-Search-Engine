Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad and Social Welfare Minister H. Anjaneya are at present visiting haadis (tribal settlements) and have assured the tribal communities of implementing the Act. Mr. Anjaneya, who visited Majire wada (tribal settlement) in Uttara Kannada announced a Rs. 52-crore package for the development of the Siddi tribe. Interestingly, Keredimba and Gombegallu podis, where Mr. Anjaneya stayed a year ago, were promised that conditions would improve, but little has been done, says P.K. Ramu of the TJAF.
