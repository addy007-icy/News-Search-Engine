Adding a new variation to Kalamkari handloom weaves, the saris come with a combination of 80 per cent cotton and 20 per cent silk. The drape not only looks classy but also impresses one with its wrinkle-free quality.Apart from block-printed Kalamkari saris that take a new avatar, a line of hand-woven saris in a variety of textures greet at the Lepakshi Bazaar-2016 that began at TTD Kalyanamandapam on Friday.The fair, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited, is supported by Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), Ministry of Textiles.With 100 stalls dotting all along the venue, shoppers can browse through a variety of handcrafted products sourced from different parts of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh.Some of the stalls display khadi shirts, fabrics and Lucknowi Chikankari kurtas for men. Silk kurtas for children, jute bags, and exclusive thread-work saris form a part of the display.Those who came to exhibit their wares said that the art forms like carving Kondapalli toys have been witnessing a downward trend.“This is because it takes months to create a hand-carved product for us. However, the business is not fetching much. In addition to this, the next generation is not showing any interest in carrying the tradition forward,” says D. Verma, a craftsman from Kondapalli.After inaugurating the fair along with Executive Officer of Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi temple S.J. Madhavi, manager of Lepakshi Handicrafts Emporium K. Nagaraj said: “The platform is meant to strengthen the livelihood of the weavers and artisans, provide a direct marketing channel to buyers and restore the diminishing art forms.”The exhibition will be kept open at the venue till January 31 between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m.With 100 stalls dotting all along the venue of Lepakshi Bazaar-2016, shoppers can browse through a variety of handcrafted products
