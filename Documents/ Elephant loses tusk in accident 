A tusker lost a feet-long right tusk of his, when rammed by a Bengaluru-bound Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus, while crossing the National highway here in the small hours of Wednesday.The accident occurred when the tusker was making a bid to cross the Krishnagiri highway, near the Collector’s bungalow here.However, blocked by median barricade, the pachyderm was forced to turn around and retrace his steps, when a TNSTC bus rammed the elephant. The tusker, however, escaped, albeit with impact injury, having lost his 1.5 feet long tusk from the impact. The lone tusker later moved away to Bayannapalli Lake here, where it was found strolling the entire day, under the constant watch of the forest guards.When contacted, District Forest Officer E. Rajendran said the forest watchers will be watching the movement of the tusker, till he is warded off to the forest. As of Wednesday evening, forest department officials were monitoring the elephant to prevent it from returning to the highway. The broken tusk was taken into the department’s custody.
