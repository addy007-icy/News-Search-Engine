For nearly one year, the families of police personnel living in several residential quarters across the city have been thirsting for water. They have been forced to rely on public taps, as the water connection has been cut.The BWSSB claims that the police department owes Rs. 5 crore.Failing to get a response to several notices, the Board disconnected supply in March last year.This was despite the Police Department deducting the requisite fee from the salary of each cop every month.Home Minister G. Parameshwara on Tuesday said that though the officials concerned deducted Rs. 250 as water bill from each constable, the department did not clear dues of the BWSSB. “I have ordered an inquiry,” the Minister said.No drinking water at homeAccording to sources, police quarters and offices of the City Armed Reserves in and around Sirsi Lane on Mysuru Road owe over Rs. 2 crore while residential quarters and offices around RMC Yard, Rajajinagar, Kavalbyrasandra, Nandini Layout and Subramanyanagar police stations together owe over Rs. 1.5 crore. The police quarters at Yeshwantpur and office buildings in Malleswaram and Srirampura owe Rs. 65 lakh.Rajeshwari, the wife of a constable, said, “For the last three months, we have been carrying pots to a public tap half a kilometre away to fetch water.”A senior police officer said that the problem persisted due to ‘technical issues’. He explained that there is one meter for a block of flats and no clarity on how the bill could be divided among the residents, given the disparity in water consumption patterns.
