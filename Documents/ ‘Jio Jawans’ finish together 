102 Reliance employees comprising former commandos, ex-special forces and SPG/NSG personnel, known as ‘Jio Jawans’, together finished the 21.1-km half-marathon in an hour and 57 minutes as a tribute to defence personnel.“The 102 Jio Jawans took care to run very hard but not breast the tape 21.1 km away until each teammate had made it. This unique ‘team of teams’ effort swept a field of 40,000 participants and dozens of equally laudable ideas by the largest companies in India,” a Reliance official said.#Jio Jawan was the top trend on Twitter in India between 6.20 am and 11.50 am on Sunday, 36th in Vietnam and 46th globally, according to iTrended.com.
