Parents sending their children to an anganwadi at Moodu Vaaltur were angry after worms were found in one of the rice bags supplied to the centre under Kavaradi Gram Panchayat limits in Kundapur taluk on Saturday.The date of packaging was mentioned on the bag as November 2015, and it had been supplied to the anganwadi centre in December. The parents immediately brought the matter to the notice of the Kavaradi Gram Panchayat, which too, expressed its dismay.PurchaseAn official of the Child Development Project based in Kundapur said that the department purchased 99 metric tonnes of rice every four months from the Food Corporation of India to be supplied to 387 anganwadi centres in Kundapur taluk.Every month, 32 metric tones of rice were being supplied to these anganwadi centres.“The officials conduct random checking of rice. But it was not possible to check every bag of rice. While 90 per cent of bags contained good quality rice, it is possible that the remaining bags might have rice with worms or substandard rice because sometimes some bags get wet,” the officer said.Sadananda, Child Development Project Officer, told The Hindu that anganwadi teachers and assistants in Kundapur taluk had been directed to return any bag with substandard quality of rice or worms in it immediately and they would be replaced with bags containing good rice. He would visit the Moodu Vaalthur anganwadi and take action, he said.Other dutiesSources in the Department said that the anganwadi teachers were being put on National Population Register duty. Due to this, they had to go to enrol people.They then had to leave the anganwadi centres in charge of anganwadi helpers, which was a distraction from their main duty of running anganwadis, leading to such problems, the sources added.Official to visit the anganwadi at Moodu Vaalthur; promises action against the guilty
