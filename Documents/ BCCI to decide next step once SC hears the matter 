Shaken by Justice RM Lodha committee’s recommended reforms of its governance structure, a cautious BCCI is mulling the option of challenging them in the Supreme Court.“I haven’t seen the report and I would not answer any queries unless I read the complete report of the Lodha panel,” said BCCI president Shashank Manohar.Once Justice Lodha made the contents of the report public, most of the top office-bearers came to the conclusion that the next step will be decided once the Supreme Court hears the matter.None of the officials want to come on record till the matter is heard in the apex court, but two key areas for the officials is age-cap and the tenure along with cooling-off period in the interim.“While the commission states that they did not want to hurt BCCI’s autonomy but some of the suggestions are direct infringement on the autonomy of the board. It was Sharad Pawar, under whose presidency, BCCI introduced pension scheme for players. Pawar saab is still active in Indian politics. You can’t stop him for being above 70 years,” said a senior BCCI official.The other point of concern is the cooling-off period between holding two posts.“If a person has done good work as the secretary or treasurer, why do you want to stop him from continuing the good work as an administrator? Also, how can you limit tenure? We don’t take government subsidies. The selection committee size is being reduced to three. How can three selectors cover 27 Ranji Trophy teams across four to five months?” asked another influential official.
