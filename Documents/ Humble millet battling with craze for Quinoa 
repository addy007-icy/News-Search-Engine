The recent spurt in interest over South American crops of Chia and Quinoa - branded as super foods - has triggered a debate among conservationists and agricultural scientists that indigenous dry land crops like millet with a higher nutrition value, are being given a short-shrift.While Chia is a Mexican variety of crop, Quinova is indigenous to South American countries besides parts of Asia, Africa etc and claimed to be effective against diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.The Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has also endorsed these two crops and distributed the seeds to farmers for cultivation in and around Mysuru region.But Sahaja Samrudha, an organisation propagating conservation of indigenous variety of crops besides organic and natural farming has taken exception to it.The general argument is that short-term gains are being ignored over long-term ramifications. Mr. G. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samrudha said all food systems evolve around local crops and cautioned against experimenting in the present times of climate change and erratic rainfall.A view also endorsed by agriculture scientists from Visvesvaraya Farm in Mandya. Dr.C.R.Ravishankar, who is part of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Small Millets told The Hindu that the health benefits of millets are proven but the crop was being ignored by farmers and the authorities in pursuit of commercial crops of the imported variety which may have short-term benefits but pitfalls in the long run.He said the national project on small millets is focussing on improving the yield of foxtail millet, kodo millet, proso millet, barnyard millet, little millet and finger millet which can be cultivated under extreme drought conditions. The craze for Chia and Quinova will not last long and farmers will be in doldrums after a few seasons, warned Ravishankar.Foxtail millet and Little millets were common in old Mysuru, like Gundlupet, Nanjangud, Hassan, Nagamangala, while Kodo millet and Browntop millet was cultivated in Andhra Pradesh and known to be drought resistant, according to Krishnaprasad who documents indigenous crops on the decline.‘’This tendency to revere all things imported is a colonial mindset’’, he said and wanted the State Government to introduce millets under the midday meal scheme and Anna Bhagya in view of their nutrition value besides creating demand for these crops.
