The former Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) leader and Kalimpong MLA, Harka Bahadur Chettri, on Wednesday announced formation of a new party — the Jan Andolan Party.Besides Mr. Chettri, other members of the party include former Vice-Chancellor of Sikkim University Mahendra P. Lama, who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Darjeeling hills.Former GJM central committee member Amar Lama and Anmol Prasad have also joined the party. The party’s name and flag were unveiled at a major rally on the Kalimpong Mela Grounds.The announcement assumes significance as it comes ahead of the Assembly polls. There are high chances that Mr. Chettri will contest Assembly polls from the Kalimpong seat and pose a challenge to the supremacy of the GJM in the hills.The GJM holds its sway over the three hill subdivisions, Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong, which sends three MLAs to the State Assembly.Mr. Chettri told The Hindu that the agenda of the party was to develop the basic infrastructure of the hills. “Over the past 30 years, the politics in the hills have been centred on the creation of a separate State. The party will also work to ensure that employment is created,” he said.The party’s name and flag were unveiled at a major rally on the Kalimpong Mela Grounds
