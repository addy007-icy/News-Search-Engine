The Kerala High Court on Thursday quashed the criminal case registered against actor Prithviraj for not properly displaying the statutory warning against liquor consumption in a particular scene in a Malayalam film.Justice B. Kemal Pasha, while allowing a petition filed by Mr. Prithviraj, said that the actor of a film, whether he had done the lead role or not, could not be brought within the purview of Section 55 I (1) of the Abkari Act. As per the Section, whoever exhibits or causes to exhibit any cinema having a scene in contravention of the Section (1), in any theatre shall be punishable for the offence. The court said that in fact, the owner of the theatre which screened the film could be made an accused in such cases.The prosecution case was that statutory warning against consumption liquor exhibited on a scene of the Malayalam film Seventh Day was not legible and that it did not confirm to the size prescribed under Section 55 I(1) of the Abakri Act.
