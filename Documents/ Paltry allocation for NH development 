erala, blamed for the slow progress of development of nine National Highway (NH) stretches passing through the State, has received a paltry allocation of Rs.558.24 crore since 2012-13 from the Centre.The allocation to the various States has gone up over the years, with the national funds touching Rs.81,006.99 crore in 2015-16, but Kerala has been given only 0.043 per cent of the total allocation on an average during the successive four financial years. In 2015-16, the State has to be content with Rs.82.24 crore, through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH).The lowest allocation of Rs.67.18 crore was received in 2014-15 while the highest of Rs.272.72 crore was in 2013-14. In 2012-13, the Centre’s allocation was Rs.136.11 crore. In fact, the change of guard at the Centre, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has not led to an increase in allocation for Kerala for the much-needed four-laning.The total allocation for the States for development of NH stretches that was Rs.29,503.48 crore in 2012-13 and Rs.31,495.20 crore in 2014-15 was hiked to Rs.81,006.99 crore this financial year. The allocation includes funds provided for the National Highway Development Project (NHDP) through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).Although there has been an inordinate delay on the part of the State in acquiring land needed for NH development, official sources said there is no justification for the paltry allocation from the Centre. Often, the government and Public Works Department had to knock at the doors of MORTH for funds for the development of NH and NH bypasses.The expenditure of the allocation since 2012-13 shows that Kerala has utilised Rs.530.83 crore of the Rs.558.24 crore allocated during the four years. In 2014-15, the entire Rs.67.18 crore had been utilised.In the current financial year, Rs.53.35 crore of the Rs.82.24 crore allocated had been spent.The State is expecting enhanced allocation in the forthcoming Union budget as decks had been cleared for the four-laning of the NH 66 stretch from Cherthala to Kazhakuttam. The government is looking towards Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari’s assurance that funds will not be a problem if land is acquired and handed over.
