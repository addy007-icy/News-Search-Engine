DMK president M. Karunanidhi on Monday appeared before a sessions court in Chennai in connection with a criminal defamation case moved against him by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Recording the appearance of Mr. Karunanidhi, Principal Sessions judge N. Authinathan adjourned the case to March 10 . On November 24, City Public Prosecutor M.L. Jegan on behalf of the Chief Minister moved a defamation charge against Mr. Karunanidhi and S. Selvam, editor of DMK mouthpiece Murasoli. The allegation was that the DMK leader published an article in Murasoli dated November 21 criticising the “achievements” of the AIADMK government over the last four years. The applicant alleged that the contents were defamatory per se.At 10.15 am when Mr. Karunanidhi arrived in the court hall in the Madras High Court premises, it was already packed with hundreds of DMK cadre and advocates. He was accompanied by M.K. Stalin, Kanimozhi, Dayanidhi Maran, T.R. Balu, Duraimurugan and party leaders.Addressing the media later, Mr. Karunanidhi said, “Justice will prevail and people should unite behind justice.” Pointing out a recent observation of the apex court, he said, “The Supreme Court itself has observed that the government is not proceeding on the right track by charging the critics with defamation. So I have nothing more to say.”On whether he would demand that the government take back all defamation cases against journalists, he said, “My decision to appear before the court itself denotes that I am for such a demand.”
