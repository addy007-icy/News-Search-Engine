Paying homage to the socialist leader Raj Narain on his 29th death anniversary on Thursday, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh said that working for the poor will be true homage to the great personality.“Raj Narain was a great personality who created history. He had always raised his voice for the poor and deprived sections of society,” Mr Singh said while addressing the programme at the party headquarters here to pay homage to the socialist leader.“True homage to him (Narain) will be to work for the welfare of the poor and farmers and opposing injustice,” he said.The SP chief said that Raj Narain distributed his land among the people who worked on it and did not keep anything for his family.Recalling his association with the socialist leader, Mr Singh said, “Raj Narain gave shape to Ram Manohar Lohia’s slogan of continued struggle against injustice while taking forward the socialist movement.” Mr Narain, the only leader who had defeated Indira Gandhi in an election (1977), died of a heart attack on December 31, 1986. -- PTI
