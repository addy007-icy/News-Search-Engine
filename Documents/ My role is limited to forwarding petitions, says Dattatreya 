Union Minister for Labour and Employment Bandaru Dattatreya, who is drawing flak for his alleged role in the developments at the University of Hyderabad that allegedly led to the ‘social boycott’ of five Dalit students, on Wednesday clarified that he had only discharged his responsibilities as a people’s representative.In a press release, he said he was an elected MP from Secunderabad and since the 80s, had always been a leader connected with the downtrodden in particular and to all sections of the society on a day-to-day basis, whether he was in any position of power or not. With such a profile, taking representations from the people and forwarding them to the concerned ministries was his earnest responsibility, he said.Accordingly, he had forwarded a representation from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) that he received on August 10, 2015, to the Union Ministry of Human Resources Development. In his covering letter, he said he had only expressed his wish that things would change for the better on the campus. With another ABVP representation, the Union Minister said he had only requested the HRD Ministry to look into the matter and do the needful, and that he had in no manner influenced any decisions taken by the varsity in the case directly or indirectly.“My role was only limited to forwarding the two representations. I would have happily forwarded similar representations from any other student body if they had approached me,” he said, hoping that the matter would now rest with the clarification. He also said he had extended his heartfelt condolences to the family of Rohith Vemula, the research scholar who took the extreme step by hanging himself recently, and wished the family the strength to overcome the irreparable loss.I would have happily forwarded similar representations from any other student body if they had approached me, says the Union Minister
