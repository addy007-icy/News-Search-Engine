In a comment that raised eyebrows at the valedictory event of the Indian Science Congress here, Governor Vajubhai R. Vala on Thursday said that girls need not go to colleges “as though they were going to a beauty contest” wearing lipstick and with their eyebrows trimmed.Though boys and girls were equally intelligent, girls are more serious in studies than boys, he said. But, he said, there was no need for girls to be fashionable while attending college.The Governor asked boys to guard themselves against falling prey to unhealthy addictions.Mr. Vala said the present generation of children was very intelligent. “A small boy can repeat fluently an entire advertisement that he would have seen on TV sometime earlier. During our times, we were unable to understand lessons even if our teacher taught them thrice,” Mr. Vala said jocularly.The present-day youth were scoring very high marks in exams, he said. “Securing 90 to 95 marks has become the norm now. When we were studying, such high marks would be the total of three years,” the Governor said in a lighter vein.
