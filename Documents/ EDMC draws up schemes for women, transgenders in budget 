: Social welfare schemes, including employment for transgender people and medical insurance for cycle rickshaw drivers, will be the top priorities of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation in the next financial year.In her budget speech to the House on Monday, EDMC Standing Committee chairperson Lata Gupta said kiosks would be built in 2,100 municipal parks. These kiosks could be used to run small shops, including for photocopy, bakeries and tailoring. Fifty per cent would be reserved for women, 10 per cent for differently-abled people and 2 per cent for transgender.“This is the first time that we are making reservations for transgender. Our aim is to bring them into the mainstream of society by giving them a chance to earn their livelihoods,” said Ms. Gupta. The cash-strapped EDMC, which has been unable to pay pensions for over two years, will be starting a medical insurance scheme for cycle rickshaw drivers and women street vendors.“We will extend the benefit of the Centre’s health insurance scheme to these people. We will involve advertising agencies, who will pay for the insurance premiums and put advertisements on the back of rickshaws to generate revenue,” said Ms. Gupta. Meanwhile, to increase revenue the EDMC will be increasing the tax on cinema halls, which could impact ticket prices.The ‘show tax’ was Rs.10 per show per hall earlier. East Delhi cinemas will now have to pay 5 per cent of the total amount collected through ticket sales for each show. All these proposals will have to be cleared by the House to be implemented.To increase revenue, the EDMC has planned to increase tax on cinema halls, which could impact ticket prices
