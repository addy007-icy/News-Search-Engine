Playing for pride, South Africa was in a commanding position on 224 for 1 at tea on the first day of the fourth test against an unimpressive England on Friday.Amla and Cook improved their unbeaten partnership to 189. Offspinner Moeen Ali had England’s only breakthrough, when Dean Elgar was caught brilliantly at short leg by James Taylor in the first session.South Africa’s impressive batting display came too late, though. England wrapped up a series victory with a win in the third test in Johannesburg last weekend to take an unassailable 2-0 lead into the final game in Centurion.Teams:South Africa: Stephen Cook, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers (captain), JP Duminy, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wicketkeeper), Kyle Abbott, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel.England: Alastair Cook (captain), Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Joe Root, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wicketkeeper), Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes, James Anderson
