N.A. Madhyastha, environmental biologist, has said that reckless sand extraction in the coastal districts could have manifold environmental consequences. Dr. Madhyastha told The Hindu that west-flowing rivers were short and the sand deposition was limited when compared to sand extraction. This affected the river bottom. When the river bottom became deeper, it led to erosion of river banks. It could also lead to depletion of sand at river mouths. This might also aid sea erosion. When excess sand was extracted, the river course became deeper and this could lead to an increase in saline water intrusion. “If this is viewed in relation to the rise in the sea level, the situation becomes worse because the sea intrudes further into the river course. This can affect coastal biodiversity,” he said.Excess sand extraction can affect bridges and buildings nearby. “As the river became deeper, the groundwater level too is affected and leading to poor water level in nearby wells,” he said.
