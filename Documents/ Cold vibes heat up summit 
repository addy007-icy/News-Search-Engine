They were seated on the same stage, but not once did Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal acknowledge each other’s presence at the Bengal Global Business Summit on Friday.Sharing the stage with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, Mr. Jaitley and Mr. Kejriwal avoided any interaction. Even when the arrangement on the dais brought them face to face, they chose to look in different directions.In the nearly 24 hours that they spent in Kolkata, Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Jaitley were never seen together. In fact, Mr. Kejriwal left the dinner hosted by Ms. Banerjee early on Thursday night, well before Mr. Jaitley arrived.At the summit, Mr. Kejriwal sat through Mr. Jaitley’s speech, but the Finance Minister was not present when the Delhi Chief Minister spoke about the odd-even scheme and the difficulties faced by his government.The Delhi government has attacked Mr. Jaitley over lleged corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).
