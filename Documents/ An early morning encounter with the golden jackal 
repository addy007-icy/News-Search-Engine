A professor living on the lush green campus of Madras Christian College in East Tambaram encountered a lovely sight recently — a pair of jackals strolling through the scrub-filled landscape.Selvasingh Richard, assistant professor of Botany in the college said: “I was on my usual walk around 7.30 a.m. on Saturday when I saw a pair of Golden Jackals ( Canis aureus ) near the overflowing lake.“I was taken aback to see the jackals heading towards me. As I paused for a while to photograph the duo, I observed that the female jackal was walking ahead, with the male following her. I maintained a safe distance, but the male hid in the bushes, while the female stood still and stared for a moment,” he recalled.Mr. Richard added that though there have been many sightings of the Indian fox ( Vulpes bengalensis ) — kulla nari — the Golden Jackal has rarely been seen. “The duo was here probably because of the green canopy and salubrious vegetation that provides food and shelter,” he added. “Despite academic growth and the accompanying need for infrastructure development, the college does not disturb the rich fauna of the campus,” R. W. Alexander Jesudasan, Principal and secretary of the college said. Officials of the Forest Department said that Golden Jackal was once a very common breed in the scrub jungle areas of the city and suburbs, but was now rarely seen due to habitat loss and hunting.
