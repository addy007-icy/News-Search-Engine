At age 20 and in his final year of college in Amravati district in Maharashtra, Keshav Daga has already devised a plan to create a base of technologically-enabled rural entrepreneurs who will act as soil consultants.The idea stems from a project that his family business started about eight years ago, but on the Jagriti Yatra 2015, he is still searching for ways to expand its scope.Mr Daga’s family is into manufacture of health care consumables like surgery masks, but had branched out into the agriculture technology, developing a portable soil-testing unit that could read the chemical parameters of a soil sample to ascertain its health. It was developed along with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in Pusa.“The first model kit cost about Rs 3,000 and was good for about a 100 tests. Based on its success, about one year ago, the ICAR awarded our company a more advanced kit called a soil testing and fertilizer recommendation meter,” Mr Daga explains.“The advantage with this kit is if a farmer wants to grow wheat it can tell you how much potassium for instance, the soil has and how much more it needs as per the crop.”Rather than selling it outright, Mr Daga’s plan is two-fold. One option is to rent out the kit to panchayats for a certain time period for about Rs 2,000 a month. The other is to give the machine to budding rural entrepreneurs along with a comprehensive training course in soil health, and to encourage them to offer their services to other farmers around their regions.The machine would be sold at a subsidised rate or a pay-as-you-go model could be utilised so that the total cost of the machine can be recovered in about six months or a little more.“This will be very useful because a lot of farmers don’t know the exact amount of fertilizer to use. These entrepreneurs could charge a small amount for soil consultation and then over time they will have to prepare a soil health chart that will be used as a guide,” he says.Since he is not from the Vidharba region, Mr Daga explains such soil consultancy services could help farmers understand how to grow crops using less water or what sort of other crops need to be planted in their fields in order to increase yield.The idea of facilitating rural entrepreneurs developed from his interaction with farmers in that region.“Many of them were suspicious of soil testing and they said it’s no use because someone comes once a year after the crops are harvested. I asked them what if someone from their own village or community took up the profession instead and immediately their response was they would be far more likely to trust that person.”Soil consultancyservices could help farmers understandhow to grow cropsusing less water
