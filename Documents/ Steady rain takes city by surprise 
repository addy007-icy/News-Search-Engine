A gloomy sky and a low mist that skirted high-rises eventually ended in steady rain that took the city by surprise on Wednesday.The city received 4.4 mm of rainfall – or around three times the ‘normal’ rainfall for the entire month – between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.The unusual rain – Bengaluru records the lowest rainfall in January – is due a series of meteorological movements that has seen clouds hover over the city. “There is an upper air cyclonic movement over the Bay of Bengal and a trough of low pressure over the Arabian Sea. Both have led to cloud formation, and eventually rain,” says S.M. Metri, Director of the Indian Meteorological Department, Bengaluru.As a result, the maximum temperature dipped to around 25 degree Celsius while the minimum temperature rose by four degrees to nearly 20 degree Celsius as a layer of thick cloud tends to trap heat. However, even at these ‘winter’ temperatures, clouds tend to hover close to the surface, leading to a persistent mist that greeted citizens throughout the day. IMD expects cloudy weather with ‘light to moderate rain’ for at least the next two days.
