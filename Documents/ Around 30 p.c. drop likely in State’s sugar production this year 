Despite sugarcane crushing operations starting early this season (in November), the State’s total crushing and sugar production is expected to be affected by 20 to 30 per cent this year, thanks to drought and other conditions.The total sugarcane crushed this season till December-end was around 149.05 lakh tonnes from which 14.87 lakh tonnes of sugar has been produced.The average sugar recovery being 10 per cent, as per the data provided by 65 working sugar mills to the office of the Commissioner for Cane Development and Director of Sugar.Though crushing will continue till February, the factories may soon start facing shortage of raw material.In contrast, 62 mills in 16 districts had crushed 450.82 lakh tonnes of sugarcane and produced 49.8 lakh tonnes of sugar, at an average recovery of 11.05 per cent during 2014–15 (till the end of season), said director of S. Nijalingappa Sugar Institute, R.B. Khandagave.“Poor rainfall and inadequate electricity supply to irrigation pump sets have adversely affected the State’s sugar production. Though there is water in some of the rivers and reservoirs, shortage of power supply has affected pumping of water,” said Mr. Khandagave.Ironically, many sugar mills will fall short of sugarcane in the next two to three years as they had enhanced crushing capacities without making efforts to expand sugarcane area in their operational areas.They had not assessed the ground realities before increasing crushing capacities. Also, a few more sugar mills are coming up in Belagavi district and other parts of the State, and the shortage of raw material could lead to unhealthy competition in the days to come, added Mr. Khandagave.
