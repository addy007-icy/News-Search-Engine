The Telugu Desam Party has tentatively decided to allot one third of the 150 seats in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation to its electoral ally Bharatiya Janata Party.The TDP leadership is learnt to have taken a decision after examining the pros and cons of the seat sharing adjustment with the BJP. The two-third: One-third formula is understandably based on the existing strengths of the two parties in the Greater Hyderabad limits.The TDP could win 10 Assembly seats and the BJP five in the previous general elections and the two parties had one Lok Sabha member each in the GHMC area.The TDP won over 40 divisions and the BJP had to be content with five in the previous elections to the corporation in 2009. “It has been tentatively proposed to adopt the two third: one third formula from our side,” a senior leader privy to the developments said.Telangana TDP working president A. Revanth Reddy, however, said the two parties initiated discussions on the seat sharing pattern and the clear picture was likely to emerge by Thursday evening.There could be minor differences cropping up between the two parties on the seat sharing ratio, but the leaderships of the two parties would iron out the differences and ensure that “we will put up a coordinated effort”.
