A three-day conclave of Uttar Pradesh NRIs will begin in Agra on Monday with the Akhilesh Yadav government hoping to bridge communication gaps, forge better ties and bonds, and attract investments for infrastructural projects particularly in the energy sector.The event will be inaugurated by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and over 150 NRIs from countries like the US, Canada, Singapore and Fiji are expected to participate in it.“NRIs will not only be apprised of the progress the State has made under the stewardship of Akhilesh Yadav but will also be familiarised with the facilities that the State would provide for investment in any field,” Vishal Kapoor, a member of U.P. Film Vikas Parishad, told reporters here.NRIs who have excelled in various fields will be felicitated at the event. “Efforts would be made to expose youths before NRIs and prepare a viable ground for any investment in U.P.,” Mr Kapoor said.The State government is making arrangements for the investment of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in Metro projects in five cities including Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi.He claimed that at present the growth rate of the State stood at 6.8 per cent which is higher than the national growth rate. “Rs 20,000 crore have been invested during the past two years in small and medium industries,” he added.Meanwhile, the State government said it has invited only NRIs from U.P. and there may have been some confusion.The State government did not extend invitation to any non-U.P. NRI, the official said, adding “the incident may have occurred due to some misunderstanding”. -- PTI
