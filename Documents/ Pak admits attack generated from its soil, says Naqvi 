Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Monday said that Pakistan for the first time has admitted that a terror attack like the Pathankot strike was generated from its soil.“This is the first time Pakistan admitted that the action was generated from its land. It is also the first time that all countries sided with India, unlike on previous occasions,” the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs told a public meeting at Kute, about 18 km from here.The Modi government had asked Islamabad to take action against the perpetrators in the Pathankot terror attack and that the country would not sit silently without a concrete response, he said.“I assure you that the country’s security is in safe and strong hands. Nobody can hurt the country’s interest,” he said and warned that those who would try to harm the nation would be dealt with strongly.He said the Centre had also protected the Indian economy amidst the “shaken economies” of China, the US, Japan and several other countries.Under these circumstances, the Indian economy was safe and secure because of its people and a strong leadership, Mr. Naqvi said.Referring to media queries about the threat of ISIS and al-Qaida, he said:“I am proud and glad that ISIS/al-Qaida like organisations are unsuccessful in putting their foot in this country because of the nationalistic feelings of the Muslims. And such forces will never be successful.”Mr. Naqvi is on a two-day tour of Ranchi to take the feedback of people for the next central budget.Phagwara: Union Minister Vijay Sampla has supported Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal’s demand for heightened security along the international border with Pakistan in Punjab saying the “vulnerable” border needs “meticulous” monitoring.Talking to media persons on Monday, the Hoshiarpur MP said vigilance at the international border with Pakistan should be maintained meticulously as it is quite porous and vulnerable.Mr. Badal had on Sunday urged the Centre to treat the Punjab frontier at par with Jammu andKashmir as regards deployment of Border Security Force for checking infiltration, in the wake of Pathankot terrorist attack.Disagreeing that Pathankot Airbase attack will adversely affect plans for turning Adampur defence air station into a civilian airport, Mr. Sampla said the issue of starting domestic flights from there has reached an advanced stage.“Actually, three airlines, including Air India, SpiceJet and Indigo, have shown interest in operating domestic flights from Adampur,” he said.Claiming that the SAD-BJP alliance was “rock solid and will contest next polls together”, Mr. Sampla saw no threat from the AAP whom he called a “leaderless party”.
