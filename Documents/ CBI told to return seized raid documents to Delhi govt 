The CBI was on Wednesday directed by a special court to return some documents seized by it during the raids at the office of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar to the Delhi government.While disposing of an application filed by the >Delhi government seeking release of some of the documents seized by the agency during its raid in December 2015, Special CBI Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said, “Directions have been given to release the documents.”“The application dated December 21, 2015, filed by the Government of NCT of Delhi is disposed of. The CBI is directed to release the documents in terms of para number 8 of the order,” the judge said while pronouncing the order.In its plea, Delhi government had also sought initiation of stringent action against erring officials responsible for raiding “malafidely the office of applicant and seizing documents, which cause immense dislocation of work in the office of the applicant.”The CBI had earlier told the court that the raid at Mr. >Kumar’s office was not aimed at the Delhi government but against an alleged corrupt officer, who had misused his official position.
