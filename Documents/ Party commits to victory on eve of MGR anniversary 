AIADMK general secretary and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Saturday asked party cadre to start working right away to achieve an unprecedented victory in the ensuing Assembly polls.In a message addressed to them on the eve of the 99th birth anniversary of party founder MGR, she expressed confidence that the AIADMK would be in power to celebrate his birth centenary next year.Only a win which no other party in India’s history will ever be able to secure, can add to the fame of her mentor whom she adores as her mother, father, teacher and God, she said. “In the coming elections, the AIADMK should achieve a victory, the like of which has not been witnessed in any earlier poll. I have no doubt that the services that my government has undertaken would ensure such a win,” she said.Recalling MGR’s service to the people of the State, she said, “MGR introduced me, your beloved sister, to the fields of art, politics and public service. He gave me the requisite lessons and training. I follow his golden footsteps dedicating myself in the service of the people of Tamil Nadu.”Ms. Jayalalithaa said MGR’s contribution to the fine arts and the world of politics in the last century is unparalleled.The reason for his reaching such great heights was his hard work, determination and welfare-oriented schemes. His life and ideologies will remain a guiding light for generations to come.Indirectly taking a dig at the DMK, she said, “The people of Tamil Nadu would never forget or forgive the period of the dark rule of the evil force.”
