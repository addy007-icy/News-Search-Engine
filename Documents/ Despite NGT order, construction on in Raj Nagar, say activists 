A week after the National Green Tribunal stayed the construction of the City Club in Sector 8 of Raj Nagar, environment activists have alleged that construction is on in full swing for the multi-storey recreational spot.The activists have alleged a nexus between the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), which is building the club in a green belt, and those it favours.“It (alleged construction) clearly demonstrates the concern for law by the GDA. While the multi-crore club, details and cost of which have not been disclosed by the GDA, has been built in stark contravention to different State and Central laws and several HC and SC orders on green belts, it also has a 20-foot deep basement in a park, which is yet another violation of an SC order allowing mining/excavation only up to five feet — that too manually,” said Akash Vashishtha, a conservation coordinator and policy analyst from Society for Protection of Environment and Biodiversity (SPEnBIO).Earlier, the NGT had stayed the construction of the club on the basis of a petition filed by Mr. Vashishtha highlighting the deplorable condition of green belts across Ghaziabad. SPENBIO had maintained that the civic agencies seemed to have failed in maintaining the green areas, which were being used as waste land instead.Rubbishing the NGO’s claims and stating that those who spot illegal construction should approach the authorities directly, GDA vice-chairman Vijay Kumar Yadav said, “We are strictly going as per the court order. There is a stay on construction till February 2. Also, the tendering process is underway and there is no question of construction.”The NGT in its latest order had asked the Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam (GNN), the GDA and the UP State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC), the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and Awas Vikas to file replies to the allegations the NGO had levelled.“Our petition has only brought to light the abuse and total disregard for environment in Ghaziabad. We have questioned the construction of the City Club by the GDA, allotment of shops on a green belt in Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC), and disposal of municipal solid waste and sewage in a forest spread over 200 acres,” noted Mr. Vashishtha.
