The Congress is flooded with applications for tickets to contest the elections to the taluk and zilla panchayat.Block Congress presidents of all seven taluks have submitted bag full of applications along with the fees to the District Congress Committee office.Aspirants, who could not submit the application forms, thronged the party office to submit them on Saturday, which was the last day to do so. Though the DCC initially refused to accept the application forms directly from the aspirants, he later received them following pressure from senior party leaders.Rise in feesMany aspirants, who were unaware that they had to submit a demand draft along with the application, were seen pressurising the DCC office-bearers to accept cash as banks were closed. However, party president B.J. Vijaykumar refused to accept the cash. The DCC finally agreed to accept the demand draft by Monday from the aspirants.The steep rise in application fees seems to have not discouraged ticket-seekers.Mr. Vijaykumar told The Hindu that the DCC had received hundreds of applications from the district.There are at least six aspirants for the party ticket for each zilla panchayat constituency and over 15 for taluk panchayat.
