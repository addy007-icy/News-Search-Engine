A city court on Thursday issued arrest warrant of Mohammed Sohrab, father of Sambia Sohrab, prime accused in the January 13 hit-and-run case in which an IAF officer was mowed down by a speeding car during Republic Day parade rehearsal.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of Bankshal Court, Sanjay Ranjan Pal, issued the warrant against Mohammed Sohrab, said to be a Trinamool Congress member, on Kolkata Police prayer.Kolkata Police Joint Commissioner (Crime) Debasish Boral said the senior Sohrab could be a “key” person in cracking the case and hence the plea for the warrant was made.“We believe that Mohammed Sohrab knows much of what happened after the January 13 mishap. Going by the developments in the case, it seems he had helped Sambia and others to flee,” Mr Boral said. - PTI
