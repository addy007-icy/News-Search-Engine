Soon after two foreign tourists staying in Kovalam were allegedly assaulted by a man, the City police have initiated measures to help prevent such unsavoury incidents in future.The man had managed to gain access into the hotel rooms of the two tourists well past midnight.According to K. Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order), the Inspector in-charge of the area, the Vizhinjam Circle Inspector in this case, and the Kovalam Sub-inspector have been instructed to verify and check all hotels and home-stays that were working illegally or did not have valid documents.The police were also asked to inspect the security arrangements made by the hotel managements in the popular tourist destination.With the police receiving information that a few ‘shady’ hotels were serving liquor, apart from harassing foreign tourists, the local police have been asked to verify these reports and to initiate stringent action against such hotels.Without permitsWith several small-scale hotels and home-stays functioning in the area, many of them without valid permits, the police will also talk to authorities concerned to identify these operators and initiate action against them.Apart from random and surprise checks on hotel occupants, those who appeared to be from suspicious backgrounds or move about suspiciously, the police would also conduct regular crackdowns to bring antisocial elements in the area behind bars, Mr. Sanjay Kumar said.With the city already being on high alert ahead of Republic Day following the Pathankot attack, the DCP said all lodges and hotels were already being checked to ensure that no suspicious elements were roaming around in the city.The police, after holding discussions with hotel owners and operators in the Kovalam region, would also issue an advisory, stipulating on mandatory security and safety measures to be followed, he added.The action came in the wake of the arrest of Nizar of Kasaragod on Thursday, after a German national lodged a complaint stating that he had barged into her hotel room and attempted to sexually harass her.Seeing his photograph in the media the next day, another woman, this time a Sweden national, too approached the police, stating that he had made an identical attack on her as well, barely an hour before the one on the German tourist.Improved security in hotels, surprise checks, part of driveTwo foreign tourists allegedly assaulted in Kovalam
