Faculty of the Government Arts College, who are members of the Joint Action Council, on Monday demanded early implementation of academic grade pay system.The University Grants Commission had declared that under the Sixth Pay Commission candidates who had taken up job with doctorate were eligible for an elevation from the Rs. 6,000 grade pay to the Rs. 7,000 grade pay after four years and those who taken up employment with M.Phil. were eligible for the upgrade after five years.The faculty had taken it up with the Government around eights months ago and the Secretary, Higher Education Department, had approved of the same by way of proceedings.But thereafter nothing much had happened except that the faculty kept sending reminders to the Government to implement the same.They had also wanted the State Government to fix seniority for those who had joined work in 1998 and regularise services of those who had started work in 2011.They also wanted the anomalies in the Fifth Pay Commission to be rectified, the faculty said.They would wait for a few more days and if the Government did not meet their demands in the next few days, the Council members would stage a protest on January 20 and 21, the faculty added.
