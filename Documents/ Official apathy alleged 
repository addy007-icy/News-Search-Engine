About 30 students of a nursing school attached to the MGM Hospital fell ill after consuming contaminated food here on Friday. They were admitted to the hospital. Of them, 10 students were still kept under observations while others were discharged. Inmates of the school said that they were not being served good food since the past three months. Apart from serving poor quality food, a proper menu was also not put in place by the contractor running the mess. A total of 243 students reside in the hostel. The hostel kitchen is in shabby condition with leaking ceiling and untidy cooking area. The students alleged that the officials never bothered to address their grievances.
