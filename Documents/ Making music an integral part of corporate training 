Ganesh G.R. believes in incorporating music in corporate training. A corporate trainer by profession, he has used his knowledge in both Indian classical and Western music forms to make his sessions interesting. Hailing from a well-known music family — he is the grandson of Kunnakudy Venkatarama Iyer — he has been trained in music from childhood.“I learnt to play the mridangam from T.V. Gopalakrishnan and Kumbakonam Rajappa Iyer. Then I started experimenting with other percussion instruments,” say Ganesh, who can also play the tabla, drums and electric pad.He has also been into light music for close to 10 years and programmed for music directors. “My knowledge in rhythm programming led me to try DJing."Apart from playing for parties, I wanted to incorporate DJing in my team-building classes. To keep the pace of a session, I found music to be very helpful,” says this resident of Thiruvanmiyur.Ganesh says, he has not let his classical training be wasted. “I have tried to fuse music from the East and the West,” he says. Ganesh next plans to create his own compositions for DJing.He can be reached at 98406 90000.
