Operators of certified homestays have demanded a clampdown on lodges, serviced villas and even shacks that camouflage as ‘homestays’, in the backdrop of the twin gang rapes reported at one such amenity in Fort Kochi heritage town.Discerning guests should check out Kerala Tourism websitewww.keralatourism.org, which has a district-wise list of certified homestays (classified as diamond, gold and silver) by the tourism agency, since there are a few hundred illegal ‘homestays’ concentrated in locales such as Fort Kochi, Munnar and Kumily. Such grave crimes cast a blot on the tremendous goodwill enjoyed by certified homestays, said M.P. Sivadattan, director of Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society (Kerala HATS).Kerala Tourism, District Tourism Promotion Councils (DTPC), civic agencies and the police should clamp down on illegal ones like the ‘homestay’ in Fort Kochi. They cannot wash their hands of the issue since homestays operate on the basis of a Government Order (GO) and norms have been prescribed for their operation. Illegal ones result in criminals turning them into their dens, Mr. Sivadattan said.In 2011, a foreign national was drugged and molested by an operator who had taken a homestay in Fort Kochi on lease.Reacting to the developments, Tourism Secretary Kamala Vardhana Rao said all homestays have to mandatorily obtain the department’s certification.Monitoring measures“Kerala Tourism would shortly set in motion a series of measures to monitor homestays and prevent misuse of the concept,” Mr. Kamala Vardhana Rao said.Following mushrooming of illegal homestays across Kerala, the State Government had in 2015 revised the accreditation norms of homestays to standardise services and facilities and simplify the classification process.The thrust was on adopting ecologically friendly practices as part of Kerala’s responsible-tourism initiative.Norms revisedA team led by B. Vijayakumar, Principal of Kerala Institute of Travel and Tourism Studies (KITTS), had finalised the revised norms.“A residential unit that gets below 50 points (out of 100) will not obtain classification and hence cannot use the name ‘homestay’.Surprise inspectionsViolations should be detected by regional committees comprising officials of Kerala Tourism and DTPC, by carrying out surprise inspections,” Mr Vijayakumar said.
