Over the last decade with the growth of cities, the amount of municipal solid waste being dumped in landfill sites too has increased. For instance, seven years ago Chennai used to generate 3,400 tonnes of waste a day and now it is 4,700 tonnes. All of this, including the food waste that can be used to power lights or converted as compost, is dumped in the landfill sites.“It would help reduce the load on the landfill sites, reduce transportation costs and manure costs for parks. Biogas plants would produce electricity that can be used by the community and provide employment,” explained a source in the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre has proven technology for micro and macro biogas plants and there are several functioning in Chennai. “A biogas plant that can handle 100 to 200 kg every day costs less than Rs. 5 lakh. It will generate 2.25 kg of methane a day, which is over four LPG cylinders a month. If more people come forward to provide food waste the cost can be reduced,” explained Daniel Chellappa, senior scientist, Technical Coordination Wing, BARC. Similarly, large hotels are being asked to implement biogas plants. “We have asked them to alter their sewage treatment plants so that the food waste is grounded and mixed with sewage to generate biogas. We have met hoteliers. We are also holding meetings with IT companies to find out if they can implement such projects,” an official said.CREDAI’s past president N. Nandakumar said nationwide developers were implementing such concepts. “Not just food waste but recyclable wastes too are being managed. CREDAI Cochin took the lead with Clean City Movement.”
