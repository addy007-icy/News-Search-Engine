The Mysuru-Varanasi Express is set to become the country’s first visually-challenged friendly train when it chugs off from the city on Tuesday.The bi-weekly express Train Number 16229/16230 which leaves Mysuru for Varanasi on Tuesdays and Thursdays, has been provided with metallic Braille signages inside the coaches indicating the berth numbers, location of alarm pull chains, toilets and emergency windows. The Braille signage also has instructions on the operation of emergency exit windows for the use of visually challenged in times of any exigency. The initiative was financed by Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, from the MPLAD Fund. Mr. Simha inaugurated and inaugurated by him on Monday.Though the Puri-Delhi Purushottam Express was the first train in the country to have a Braille-embedded coach, the Mysuru-Varanasi Express is the first train in the country where all reserved coaches have been embedded with Braille signage, said Rajkumar Lal, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru division of the South Western Railways.“The plan is to extend the facility to all the reserved coaches of long-distance trains in a phase-wise manner,” he added. Braille signage has been introduced on one rake of the Mysuru-Varanasi Express and the facility will be provided for the second rake of the same train as well. The Chamundi Express and the Mysuru-Talguppa Express are other two trains that will be provided with Braille signages after this, said Mr.Lal.The Mysuru Division, which operates 118 trains, has plans for such signages for all long-distance and express trains.Ms. Netravati, a visually-impaired person, welcomed the initiative and said that it will help them identify the seats or berths without seeking help from others. “We will be more independent and at times people do not respond properly as they to tend to be in a hurry to locate their berths,” said Netravati.However, the coach numbers have conventional signage and the plan is to affix Braille signage for the coaches as well, said officials.
