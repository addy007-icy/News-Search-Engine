Deputy Commissioner Rajendra Cholan on Tuesday set a two-day deadline for those who have built temporary structures near the Gabbur Bypass Road to clear the premises.The Deputy Commissioner announced this after some of the shopkeepers and residents staged a protest and blocked the road when a team from the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation reached the spot to begin a demolition drive.The official asked the shopkeepers to salvage their belongings within two days and told those who had built temporary houses on the municipal corporation property to clear the premises within a week.Mr. Cholan promised them that those who had built temporary houses on the encroached property would be considered for allotment of Ashraya houses on humanitarian grounds.He said that if the residents and shopkeepers failed to adhere by the deadline, a demolition drive would be carried out.Earlier, some residents and shopkeepers tried to stop the demolition drive and while some others began clearing the structures on their own. Those who opposed the drive sought to know where should they go after having resided at the locality for decades. Then they resorted to rasta roko, but the police intervened to clear the road block.Municipal authorities said that they had given advance notices to all the illegal occupants and had even marked the area belonging to the municipal corporation a few days ago asking them to clear it on their own.In all, 5,674 sq. metres of land belonging to the municipal corporation had been encroached upon, they said.Meanwhile, it came to the notice of the authorities that a school building had also come up on the corporation land.While the school authorities offered a clarification, the Deputy Commissioner said that he would direct the Block Education Officer to take action against them. Police Commissioner Pandurang Rane, Hubballi tahsildar H.D. Nagavi, and HDMC revenue officer A.R. Desai were present.
