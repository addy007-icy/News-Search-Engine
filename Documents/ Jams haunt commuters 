: The Capital continued to face jammed roads during peak hours on Tuesday. Apart from an obvious increase in the number of cars after the odd-even scheme ended, poor visibility due to fog slowed down vehicles, said the Traffic Police.The morning hours witnessed traffic snarls at several stretches such as Nehru Place and Moolchand in South Delhi. Bumper-to-bumper traffic was witnessed in Dhaula Kuan, Karol Bagh and Vikas Marg.The afternoon hours saw chock-a-block situation on the Rao Tula Ram Marg, Jasola-Sarita Vihar stretch, the Jhandewalan Road, etc. The dismantling of the BRT corridor in South Delhi also resulted in jams, but it lasted for only about 30 minutes.The roads returned to its choked status in the evening hours as vehicles moved at a snail’s pace at several spots in Lutyens’ Delhi.Traffic officers said that several incidents of buses breaking down contributed to the jams.The repeated traffic jams have prompted demands from commuters to bring back the odd-even scheme.
