The HRD ministry is mulling an initiative under which services of ex-servicemen would be utilised in schools for providing physical training and also creating awareness about sacrifices made by security forces for the nation.HRD Minister Smriti Irani said this at an event where she launched the first batch of five books for children on lives of five Param Veer Chakra awardees.Ms Irani said it is “unfortunate” that there are very few attempts to narrate to the next generation contributions of those who sacrificed everything for the country.She said apart from the stories of all 21 Paramveer Chakara awardees, books on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Swami Vivekananda, Lt Gen J F R Jacob, Sam Manekshaw, Kanak Lata, Rani Gaidinliu should be brought out.Speaking at the event, where Army Chief Dalbir Singh was also present, Ms Irani said her ministry is considering an initiative under which services of ex-servicemen would be utilised in schools for providing physical training and creating awareness about the country’s glorious history.She also sought opinion of a school Principal present as to whether could ex-serviceman provide training and awareness about sacrifices of the jawans, at least twice every week.At the event five books on the lives of Param Veer Chakra awardees Somnath Sharma, Arun Khetarpal, Shaitan Singh, Abdul Hamid and Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey were launched.Irani asked NCERT and CBSE officials to include these books in additional reading material in schools.“My request to the National Book Trust is that there may be many stories which may have got lost from history books, but it is our responsibility to again highlight them so that posterity remembers their contributions,” she said.In his speech, the Army chief said that children read about fictional heroes but through this initiative will know about “real life heroes.”He also assured support for the Minister’s initiative to utilise services of ex-service men in schools. - PTI
