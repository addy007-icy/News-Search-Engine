The Panj Pyaras (Sikh preachers) on Wednesday announced that they will continue from the highest Sikh temporal seat Akal Takht their religious service of baptising non-Sikhs in a fresh challenge to the SGPC.In a written statement, the Panj Pyaras said so far they were doing religious services (Amrit Sanchar) to make the devotees baptised Sikh after giving them religious discourses besides informing them of the communityâ€™s tenets and customs. They announced that they would continue their religious service without any fear and pressure. The announcement comes in the wake of a January 1 decision of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) dismissing four of the Panj Pyaras and declaring the fifth as retired.The next day, the Panj Pyaras had issued a religious edict asking the Sikh community to socially boycott the jathedars of five Takhts, including Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh.Notably, last year on December 28, the Panj Pyaras had asked the SGPC to remove all the five Jathedars by January 1, 2016.However, earlier last year on October 21, the Panj Pyaras had unprecedentedly challenging the working of Sikh clergy had summoned five Sikh high priests, including the Jathedar Akal Takht Gyani Gurbachan Singh, for their explanation on pardoning Sirsa-based Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and later withdrawing the pardon.When all the five Jathedars failed to appear before the Panj Pyaras, they had asked the SGPC to remove all the Jathedars of all Takhts forthwith.The edict for summoning Gyani Gurbachan Singh, Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Iqbal Singh Jathedar of Takht Patna Sahib, Giani Mal Singh Jathedar of Takht Keshgarh Sahib, Giani Gurmukh Singh Jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib and Giani Ram Singh Dhoopia, of Takht Hazoor Sahib, Nanded was passed by the Panj Pyaras.On October 21, one of the Panj Pyara Satnam Singh had said the decision to pardon Dera Sirsa chief was taken by Jathedars without consultation with any of the Sikh groups and intellectuals and has put the community in turmoil. - PTIThey announce continue their religious service without any fear and pressure
