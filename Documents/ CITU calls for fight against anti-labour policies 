Sudha Bhaskar alleged that the Union government has been welcoming foreign direct investment in various sectors and changing rules, protecting the interests of investors than that of workers. He warned that the orders for ECIL and BHEL have been coming down and they may get closed in the near future. He said that even the exports in IT sector came down drastically. Referring to the loans taken by big corporate houses and not being repaid, Mr. Sudha Bhaskar said that money saved and deposited by the common man was at stake.
