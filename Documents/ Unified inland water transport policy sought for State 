Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) would shortly issue a white paper on the need for a unified inland water transport policy for Kerala, bringing all stakeholders under one umbrella, its MD Elias George said on Friday.He was speaking at the ‘Risk Assessment Workshop on Inland Passenger Boat Safety in Kerala’ organised by the EMS Padana Gaveshana Kendram here. Currently, there are multiple regulators like Port, Irrigation and Fisheries departments apart from Marine Police. With a strong public policy found wanting, these departments indulge in a blame game when things go wrong, instead of taking corrective actions, he said.District secretary of CPI(M) P. Rajeev said that legislations originally formed during the colonial era must be amended in tune with the changing times, to strengthen safety standards and their enforcement. A major reason for boat mishaps in the State is lack of ‘fair way’ and non-adherence to safety norms, said R.M. Nair, former member of the Inland Waterways Authority of India.Fort Kochi accidentThe Fort Kochi ferry accident that claimed the life of nine passengers after a recklessly-driven fishing boat rammed the ferry was very much alive in the mind of panellists selected from among top officials of different stakeholder agencies, representatives of houseboats and tourist boats. “These vessels are popularly known as country boats, despite their massive size and ability to carry up to 100 fishermen into the high seas. Many of them are powered by ‘banned’ engines having 600 horse power. These vessels are notorious for netting thousands of newborn fish, resulting in steep fall in fish wealth in the sea off Kerala,” the panellists comprising senior officials of IMO, IWAI, Ports Department, Kochi port, KMRL’s Aqua Wing and retired Navy officers said, at the workshop of organized by EMS Padana Gaveshana Kendram.Office-bearers of associations of tourist boats, house boats and fishing boats demanded clear norms on the number of life jackets and having or wearing them.They sought frequent police inspections to prevent drivers and crew members getting drunk while on duty.
