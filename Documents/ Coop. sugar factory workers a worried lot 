Farmers and employees are looking forward to the restarting of crushing activity at the Anakapalle V.V. Ramana Cooperative Sugar Factory (Tummapala sugar factory) and are also worried that the healthy unit would be privatised.A large number of farmers and workers staged a dharna in front of the Collectorate here on Saturday demanding reopening of the factory as they feared that Sugarcane Commissioner’s meeting with MDs of sugar factories of four coastal districts scheduled to be held during the day would be the platform to decide on privatisation of the factory.This is one of the many agitations and programmes conducted by the farmers and employees after the overhauling work for 2015-16 season was completed and the factory is ready to undertake crushing of sugarcane. The CITU-affiliated Workers and Employees’ Union of the factory also submitted a memorandum to the Collector.‘Salaries not paid’District secretary of AP Koulu Rytu Sangham A. Balakrishna told The Hindu that a sum of Rs. 3 crore was due from the factory to the farmers for the sugarcane they supplied during the last season and 450 employees were without wages for the last 17 months. “They are continuing with the factory with the hope that the factory would start functioning.”There was no reason for not starting the crushing, Mr. Balakrishna said. “One lakh tonne of sugarcane is ready for crushing in the area under the factory.The farmers are ready to supply cane to Tummapala factory as the jaggery is not tempting this time since its price has fallen. If the situation continues like this the farmers have to burn their crops,” he said.Mr. Balakrishna said the Chandrababu Naidu government was planning to push the healthy sugar factory into the red and sell it to private parties.
