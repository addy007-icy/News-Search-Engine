A slice of native music played like gentle showers on a sunny day. A team of dancers tried to pass a valid message through a contemporary dance form. This was followed by an impressive couple dance where husbands and wives were seen shaking a leg to a mix of old and new filmy tracks, sporting appropriate attires.A ripple of cheer passed through the crowd when members of Kerala Kala Samithi teamed up to entertain the viewers with cultural programmes that continued at Kala Keralam function hall for a couple of hours on Sunday evening to mark Christmas and New Year celebrations.Treat to audienceFrom little ones to the elderly, each person had something to treat the audience who assembled at the hall to witness the entertainment amidst cheer and thunderous applause.Interestingly, classical dancers ventured into something new. “This time, I wanted to entertain people with unique choreography and that’s why I opted for dandiya for the show. It took almost a month for me to train 13 women in the art form,” said Beena Sashidharan, a Bharatanatyam dancer who headed the dandiya troupe.Swaying enthusiastically to ‘Prem ratan dhan payo’ title song, Anumitha Renjith, a little girl, regaled the viewers with a peppy dance. Carol singing and fashion show formed part of the entertainment.“The fun element is contributed by both past and present team members of the samithi. After a brief rehearsal, even I am going to sashay down the ramp as part of the fashion show,” said N.M. Pillai, president of the samithi.Malayalis across the city made their way to the premises and made merry witnessing a series of programmes and savouring snacks made available at the venue.
