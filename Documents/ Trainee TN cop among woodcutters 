Asked about as to why he resorted to red sanders smuggling despite selection as a constable, the youth said long-cherished poverty led him towards Tirumala hills for felling red sanders.He said he was caught in neck-deep debts after performing the marriage of three sisters. “I am also engaged and my marriage is on the cards. I took a private loan of Rs 80,000 for this purpose. Our hill areas with ST population is totally driven by poverty,” he said.The trainee-cop turned woodcutter said he had earlier made two trips to Tirumala hills, and earned Rs 30,000 each trip. “We are paid Rs 700 per kg, and a 40 kg log will get us hefty amount, in addition to travel and miscellaneous expenditure. I have come here again with a plan to clear my debts and settle after marriage,” he said.
