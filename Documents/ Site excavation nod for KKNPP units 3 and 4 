The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) has given the much-awaited ‘site excavation clearance’ for the Kundankulam Nuclear Power Project’s upcoming units of 3 and 4 even as the first reactor, which attained criticality last Thursday, is likely to be synchronised with the southern grid in 48 hours.Informing this at the Republic Day celebrations at Anu Vijay Township, the residential colony of KKNPP engineers, on Tuesday, Site Director R.S. Sundar said site excavations for the two units would commence in a few weeks. Once the excavation is completed, the ‘first pour of concrete’ for the reactor would take place within a year from now.The first reactor, after the successful completion of planned fuel outage and subsequent maintenance activities, attained criticality – the start of fission chain reaction.As the next step, reactor power would be increased in stages to generate 1,000 MW electricity, the maximum capacity as per laid down procedures and regulatory clearances.Unit 2 is in the advanced stage of commissioning and is awaiting the AERB’s nod for enriched uranium fuel loading, Mr. Sundar said.
