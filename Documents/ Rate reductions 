Even the most learned economists blame the public sector banks for being slow in passing on rate reductions (“A tale of two economists,” Jan.19). Senior bankers have clearly stated the reasons for not being able to bring down their rates — time lag for the deposit repricing to translate into reduced costs and the high rates offered by various Small Savings Schemes. Both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government are aware of this and hence the government has promised a relook into the pricing of National Savings Schemes.I also wonder why the public sector banks alone are to be blamed for not passing on the reductions in repo rates. The reductions in the base rates of private banks are certainly not much higher that those of their public sector counterparts.A.N.Appaiah,Mumbai
