Organic farmers have come under an umbrella to promote scientific organic farming in the district. They are now in the process of registering a company – Vellore Farmer Producer Company.“We currently have 350 farmers in our circle. Our aim is to promote scientific organic farming,” D. Kumaran, a farmer in Mottupalayam, and chief executive officer of the to-be registered company said.These farmers are cultivating crops on about 700 acres of land. Many crops such as paddy, chillies, brinjal, papaya, tomato, lady’s finger, mangoes and turmeric are being raised organically.He said Bangalore and Coimbatore based firms have been producing organic fertilisers for crops but not many farmers were aware of this.“We have purchased these fertilisers from the outlets, and have brought it to our field use. We will be distributing these organic fertilisers to farmers. This is to encourage them to take up organic farming and see its success,” he added.He said that the shops were giving the organic fertilisers on 60 per cent discount. “We will keep five per cent of this for the company, and give back the 55 per cent to the farmers,” Mr. Kumaran said.These farmers were following both traditional and scientific organic farming, he said, adding, “We want farmers to see the success of following scientific organic farming.” They will also train farmers in organic certification.
