Abdul Basit (28) of Chennai and S. Sheikh Abdullah (27) of Ilayangudi in Sivaganga district had occupied seats other than those assigned to them, prompting the crew to ask them to take their respective seats when the aircraft was flying.The two reportedly argued with the crew claiming that they had occupied other seats to recharge their mobile phones.The crew alerted the captain who apparently questioned them. The two allegedly were rude with the captain.Upon arrival of the flight in the early hours, an airline staff preferred a complaint with the Airport police station where the two were brought for questioning by the police.Hours later, the airline staff withdrew the complaint stating that a compromise had been reached wherein the two would be fined Rs. 60,000 for having caused damage to the seat handle.
