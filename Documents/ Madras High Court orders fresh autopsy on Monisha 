Noting that if a father expressed suspicion over the post-mortem conducted on his daughter’s body, there was nothing wrong in conducting a fresh autopsy, the Madras High Court on Wednesday allowed the plea of the father of Monisha, one of the three deceased students of SVS Naturopathy and Yoga Science Medical College, Villupuram.Justice R. Subbiah ordered a fresh post-mortem on the girl’s body in any government hospital in Chennai, in the presence of the petitioner’s doctor P. Sampath Kumar, Head of Forensic Department, Vice Principal of Sri Ramachandra Medical College, Chennai.On January 23, three girl students of the college (V. Priyanka, T. Monisha and E. Saranya) reportedly committed suicide by jumping into a farm well over alleged harassment by the management demanding “exorbitant” fees. Monisha’s father M.K. Tamilarasan approached the High Court seeking transfer of the investigation to the CB-CID. He also sought the court to order a re-post-mortem of his daughter as per the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission.When the petition came up for hearing on Wednesday, the State government, in its counter-affidavit, submitted that the post-mortem was conducted on the bodies of the other girls on January 24 by a team of doctors headed by Geethanjali, Professor, Department of Forensic Medicine, Villupuram.“The petitioner demanded that the autopsy on her daughter’s body be conducted only in Chennai and refused to cooperate with the district administration,” the public prosecutor said.( With inputs fromVivek Narayanan )
