Seventeen students, who were allegedly duped by the Interior Design Academy, Jeevan Bheema Nagar, staged a protest and lodged a complaint against owners Sainath and his wife Chaitra. Sainath was arrested after a case of cheating was registered against him.The students were admitted to a diploma course in interior designing six months ago after the couple claimed that the course was recognised by the Karnataka State Open University. However, the students landed in a soup after KSOU lost recognition from University Grants Commission. â€” Staff Reporter
