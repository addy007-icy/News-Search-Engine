Sleek beauty and sheer creativeness of jewellery is what one found at the recently concluded exhibition of jewellery at the new Jewellery Studio on Cunningham Road.Nafees Fazal (a former minister for Medical Education and Science and Technology in Karnataka) and Bharathi Raviprakash tell us about their collection and their passion for jewellery.Talking about what got her going in the first place, Nafees says, “Collecting jewellery had been my hobby since I was young. After I retired from power in 2004, I hit upon the idea of curating jewellery from different artisans. This led me to starting this Studio where every four months or so, various artisans display their works, each unique and different in their own way. I even put up my own collection here.”Bharathi Raviprakash is a renowned gemmologist, who graduated from GIA, London in 2002 and started Studio Tara in Chennai. Talking about her new range of jewellery, she says, “I loved gems from the very start. People and nature have always been my motivation. I do bold designs. I cut the gems to the designs and the time required for creating different designs varies from a year to three years or more. Finding the right gem, perfecting it to the last detail, requires time.”Describing a coral necklace, Bharathi says, “This coral flower has been carved out of a single coral stone. It took me three years to finish it.” Another unique work was a Shiva-ling ring, “In this, you can see the lingam, surrounded by the Nandi, and the conch shell. It has the chakra, the crescent and the symbols of the deities Ganesha on one side and of Subramanya on the other.” The unique and different designs, the craftsmanship shown and the consistent effort put in each piece is a delightful sight to behold.
