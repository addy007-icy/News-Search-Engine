Missing winter this season isn’t the only aspect that is unusual, but the spurt in prices of vegetables too! With the prevailing drought conditions, the prices of vegetables have gone through the roof in the district.Residents here are worried over the price of tomato that has reached Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kilogram when compared to Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg last year. Broad beans, the cheapest vegetable earlier and that which usually is available in abundance, now costs Rs. 80 per kg in the market. The prices of almost all vegetables have gone up with ridge-gourd costing Rs. 80 per kg, chillies- Rs. 80; bitter gourd - Rs. 60; cauliflower and cabbage - Rs. 40 and drumstick - Rs. 100 per kg. The cultivation of vegetables has come down drastically owing to prevailing drought conditions and depleting groundwater table in the district. The vegetables cultivated in Kudurupaka, Ithrajpalli, Gopalpur, Thimmapur, Velichala, Gudem, Chenjerla and other villages are usually shifted to Karimnagar town markets. But due to the declined flow, the markets are no more the centres of activity. Tomato used to arrive here from Madanapalli in Chittoor district. But following the recent rains and floods in Chittoor, farmers lost their crop resulting in no supplies for the district. Decline in production leading to shortage of vegetables is not just the only reason for price rise. Pest attack on vegetables is another cause that has resulted in less yield this season.“My weekly vegetable bill has gone up from Rs. 150 to Rs. 250 due to escalation in prices,” complains Manisha, a resident of Jyothinagar.
