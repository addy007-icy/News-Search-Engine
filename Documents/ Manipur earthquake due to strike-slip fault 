The 6.7 magnitude Tamenglong earthquake, which occurred 40 km to the west of Imphal early on Monday, beneath the Indo-Burmese ranges, was due to strike-slip faulting in the complex plate boundary region between India and the Sunda plate.The earthquake occurred in a region where the Indian plate was moving in a north-northeast direction vis-à-vis the Sunda plate at a velocity of approximately 36 mm per year, according to D. Sri Nagesh, seismologist and head of the seismological observatory at CSIR-National Geophysical Research Institute and V.K. Gahalaut, Director, National Centre for Seismology, Delhi.Mr. Nagesh said that the temblor occurred at a depth of close to 50 km within the lithosphere of the India plate. He said that the region was known for moderate-to-large earthquakes. He said 19 earthquakes of magnitude greater than six have occurred within 250 km of Monday’s event during the past century.The largest among them was magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 1946 on the Sagaing Fault. The other damaging earthquake of magnitude 7.3 occurred in August 1988. There was also a magnitude 6 in December 1984, which claimed 20 lives and caused injuries to 100 others.Mr. Nagesh said that 10 aftershocks, including two of magnitude more than 3.4, were recorded on Monday following the main event.
