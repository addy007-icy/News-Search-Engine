Aavin’s expanded ice cream plant at the Ambattur dairy with a capacity of 15,000 litres a day is likely to be ready by next month and at least half of the supply will be sent to parlours across the State. This step will bring more brand visibility to the milk in districts other than Chennai.The ice cream and paneer plants are being expanded at a cost of Rs. 23.50 crore and the work is nearly complete, said sources in Aavin, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation.“We will be opening 1,100 parlours in the districts coming year. Deep freezers and bottle coolers are being procured at a cost of Rs. 5 crore,” the source explained. With the new plant, Aavin will be able to increase the number of flavours. “The plant has been so designed that school children can visit it and watch how icecream is made,” the source said.
