Resolving an intriguing issue of a “huge gap” between the judges and litigants, the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has acted on a representation submitted by a group of law students who had invoked the statutory right of consumers to be heard and assured of protection of their interests.The Commission has reduced the gap between the Bench of presiding members and the place earmarked for parties to argue their cases. The students had pointed out that the big gap between the Bench and consumer applicants was creating hurdle for the latter, especially senior citizens, in putting their oral arguments while seeking relief.On their visit to the Commission last week, the students observed the impact of gap reduction in the shape of easy and hassle-free hearing. “The gap is now in line with that maintained at District Consumer Forums and the parties in person can represent their cases conveniently before the Bench,” said Paras Jain, one of the students, here on Monday.The students have represented a number of consumers in the capacity of authorised representatives. The representation was submitted in public interest to Consumer Commission president Justice Veena Birbal. It was also signed by students Anushka Sharma and Kumar Shanu.It said a large number of consumers, representing their complaints and appeals in person without engaging lawyers, were facing difficulties in communicating their grievances and in handling queries of the presiding members in a proper manner.The three law students had pointed out that the gap was defeating the very purpose of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which specifies the consumers' right to be heard and be assured that their interests would receive due consideration at an appropriate orum.Consumer panel reduces gap between judges, place for partiesto argue cases
