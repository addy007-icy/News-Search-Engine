The National Confederation of Dalit Organisations (NACDOR), a national platform for dalit organisations, has instituted ‘Rohith Vemula Student Leadership Award’ for campaign by students for the cause of social justice. The award is named after Rohith Vemula, research scholar of the University of Hyderabad, whose recent suicide has given rise to nation-wide protests.Announcing the decision at a press conference addressed by various Dalit organisations’ representatives here on Thursday, Ashok Bhati, chairman of the NACDOR said the awardee could be a student of any caste, but must have fought for the cause of Dalits, Adivasis, Bahujans, or Minorities.The award, said to be first of its kind in the country, would be customarily presented on January 27 every year, three days before Rohith’s birthday, and a day after the Republic Day. It will carry cash and a citation.Mr. Bhati also demanded renaming of ‘Dronacharya Award’ in Rohith Vemula’s name, as the mythological character ‘Dronacharya’ was notorious for severely punishing his marginalised disciple ‘Eklavya’, for learning archery. Another demand was to stop funding to the colleges and universities where SC/ST backlog vacancies are not filled up. A commission should be set up to overhaul the present education system so as to make it friendlier to the students from deprived backgrounds.
