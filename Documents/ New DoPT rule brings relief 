Taking a compassionate view of government employees whose children are under treatment for Thalassemia and Haemophilia the Central Government has noted that this category will stay exempted from routine transfers and will not be asked to take voluntary retirement on refusing such postings.The matter regarding the scope of ‘disabled’ has been examined by the Department of Personnel and Training in consultation with the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.The new rule issued by DoPT noted that children diagnosed with Thalassemia and Haemophilia require constant caregiver support and it would be imperative for government employees to take care of their child on continuous basis and that it has been decided to include Thalassemia and Haemophilia in the category of disabled child.It also noted that the upbringing and rehabilitation of disabled child requires financial support.“Making the government employee to choose voluntary retirement on the pretext of routine transfer or rotation transfer would have adverse impact on the rehabilitation process of the child,” the order noted.At present, employees with kids suffering from blindness or low vision, hearing impairment, locomotor disability or cerebral palsy, leprosy, mental retardation, mental illness, multiple disabilities and autism are spared from routine transfers.Staff whose children are under treatment for Thalassemia and Haemophilia will be exempted from routine transfers
