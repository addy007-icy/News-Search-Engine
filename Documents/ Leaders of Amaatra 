We are cool, we are calm,We are able to create our charm.We are sweet, we are cute,We are the best among all other schools.We win, we loose,But we never break the rules.It is good for everyone,If you don’t mess with the intelligent ones.We shine like the sun in the sky,We learn how to play and fly.You can call us The Brainy.We are “the Amaatrians,The future leaders”.Drishti Goel, VI A, The Amaatra Academy, Bengaluru
