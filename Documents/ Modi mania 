The inauguration of the science congress had all the trappings of a jamboree. Alongside scientists and academicians, there were a large number of students too. There were loud claps, cheering and whistling every time Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name was mentioned. The compère went over the top while introducing Mr. Modi and said: “When he speaks, the landscape listens”, and received a round of applause for this. When Mr. Modi rose to address the gathering, he received an ovation. While the loudest cheer was reserved for Mr. Modi, scientist C.N.R. Rao and the late President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam too received a fair round of applause.
