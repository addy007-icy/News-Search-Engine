Hundreds of people from Mathura and other districts in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have been duped of over Rs 250 crore allegedly by a company, which asked them to deposit “security money” to provide jobs as teacher or supervisor but closed its offices, officials said on Thursday.Some of the people who had paid between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1 lakh as “security money” filed an FIR on Wednesday against St Peters and Mother Terressa Children Education and Welfare Organisation, the police said.The company had allegedly “recruited” several people from Mathura, Agra, Aligarh, Bharatpur (in Rajasthan) for the post of home teacher and supervisor, on five-year contracts, they said.It demanded between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1 lakh from “recruits” as “security money” and paid Rs 7,000 and 10,000 respectively to home teachers and supervisors, they said.The company was operating here for the last three years.But three months back their local office, on Goverdhan road, was found closed, which has not opened since, and its office-bearers could not be found, they said, adding its head office at Badarpur border, near Delhi, was also found closed and the office-bearers untraceable.The closed offices and untraceable officials rang alarm bell for the “investors” who filed the FIR.“On the complaint of the investors, a case u/s 420 and 468 of IPC has been registered in Highway police station. The mobile numbers of company office-bearers have been kept under surveillance,” District Magistrate Rajesh Kumar said.The company used to contact people “who come either for withdrawal or deposits at banks,” the report says. Initially some beneficiaries were paid salary, who virtually became vocal advocates of the company.
