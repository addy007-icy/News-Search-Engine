In the days leading to the season of religious festivals, the Ernakulam District Administration is embarking on a plan to end the display of pyrotechnics at venues near residential areas in and around Kochi city. The step comes in the wake of an accident at Maradu, which claimed one life and caused extensive damage to residential areas.“We have already sent a letter to the police and the Tahsildars, seeking to identify such venues surrounded by residential areas and strategic installations in their respective areas. A meeting of these officers will be convened in two days time and based on the inputs from the concerned agencies, a ban will be imposed on fireworks show at venues identified as ‘sensitive,’’ said P.Padmakumar, Additional District Magistrate, Ernakulam district.The police have also come up in support of the proposal, which they regard is a necessary step to avoid fire related blazes in the city.“We will definitely support this move as the conduct of such events have become a major headache to the police,” said M.P. Dinesh, commissioner of Police, Kochi city.Meanwhile, preliminary investigations by the police have confirmed that illegal stocking of explosives led to the fatal accident in Maradu, the other day. The Thekke Cheruvoram didn’t even have a temporary licence issued by the District Magistrate for temple festivals.Cases have been registered against the executive committee members of the Thekke Cheruvaram, which stocked the gun powder, under IPC section 304 for culpable homicide.“The list of the accused will be fixed in two days and arrests will be made accordingly. A report from the Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, who visited the accident site on Saturday will be also taken into consideration for the purpose,” said Sibi Tom, Circle Inspector of Police, Ernakulam South.
