Australia has named a 13-man squad for the upcoming one-day series against India, with pacemen Joel Paris and Scott Boland set for their international debuts.Seamer Kane Richardson, who has eight ODI appearances, has also been included with Josh Hazlewood, the sole member of Australia’s fast-bowling group from their successful World Cup campaign last year.Fellow test quick James Pattinson has been left out as has the injured Peter Siddle.No specialist spinner has been included in the squad which covers the first three games of the five-match series, in Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne.Steve Smith is captain, while batsmen Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh and George Bailey have been called up, but test player Usman Khawaja has been left out, as have Shane Watson, Joe Burns and current Big Bash Twenty20 star Chris Lynn.The five-game series starts on January 12 at the WACA in Perth.The 23-year-old Paris battled injuries last season but has made a strong return, taking 14 wickets in two matches in the domestic Sheffield Shield competition.Boland was included in Australia’s squad for the second and third tests against the West Indies but didn’t break into the match XI.“Scott has continued to impress the selection panel, having bowled very well for Victoria this year,” selection chairman Rod Marsh said. “He certainly deserves this chance at the top level.“Joel is an exciting young left-arm bowler who swings the ball well and has bowled beautifully in the Big Bash League for the Perth Scorchers. He has had very good figures in short-form cricket and we really want him to make the most of this opportunity.”Richardson returns to the Australia squad for the first time since its one-day series against South Africa last year. “Kane has had a taste of cricket at the international level and although that has been interrupted on occasions through injury we think he is ready to perform consistently for Australia,” Marsh said.Fast bowlers James Pattinson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Patrick Cummins and John Hastings are either unavailable or have been omitted. Paris, Boland, Richardson, Marsh and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade are the only members of the squad who were not part of the World Cup last year.All-rounder James Faulkner returns to the squad after missing the recent series against England for disciplinary reasons while test all-rounder Shaun Marsh has also been recalled.———Australia squad: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, George Bailey, Scott Boland, Josh Hazlewood, James Faulkner, Aaron Finch, Mitch Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Kane Richardson, Joel Paris, Matthew Wade
