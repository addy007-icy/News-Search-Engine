Even as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) picked up several terror suspects from across the country, including six from different parts of Karnataka, security was heightened at the city railway station.Passengers and visitors to the railway station were directed to pass through door frame metal detectors (DFMD) and hand-held metal detectors were used to check their luggage.However, railway police said there was no reason to worry. “It is a routine security check that we do ahead of Republic Day celebrations every year.”Another police official said that security at the railway station was tight since the first week of January after the terror strike at the Pathankot airbase.Meanwhile, Police Commissioner B. Dayananda said that routine policing continued in the city. “We have not received any input that should cause concern,” he said.
