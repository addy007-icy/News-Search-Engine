Delhi Waveriders stuck to its plan and earned its second consecutive away win here on Saturday to be the only undefeated team in the fourth edition of the Hockey India League so far and go on top of the table with 10 points.Delhi beat Uttar Pradesh Wizards 3-1 against the run of the play. The host dominated a large part of the game, but paid the price for a weak and wayward forward line — Australians Jamie Dwyer and Eddie Ockenden had a good game as feeders, but the strikers’ attempts were weak and the Delhi defence rock solid. Akashdeep Singh conceded several turnovers, Tobias Hauke was off-target and Ramandeep Singh invisible on field.Some outstanding defence by Rupinder Pal Singh, Surender Kumar and Vickram Kanth not only defied a constant wave of attacks from UP, but also tackled brilliantly to only concede one penalty corner, in the final minute, that saw Gonzalo Peillat score to ensure one point for his team.UPW skipper V.R. Raghunath combined with Vikas Pillay to orchestrate his team’s chances.Kenneth Bain started the glut, finding the post in the third minute. Akashdeep Singh did the same a few minutes later and then Bain, put through by Agustin Mazzilli, sent a weak shot parried easily by DWR goalkeeper Devon Manchester.The visitor’s first real chance came in the 30th minute, but Raghunath managed to clear the danger despite at least eight players crowding the goal. The deadlock was broken in the 42nd minute when Rupinder made no mistake with Delhi’s first penalty corner. Peillat pulled one back for UPW but it was not enough.The result: Delhi Waveriders 3 (Rupinder Pal Singh-pen, Steven Edwards FG) bt Uttar Pradesh Wizards 1 (Gonzalo Peillat-pen).
