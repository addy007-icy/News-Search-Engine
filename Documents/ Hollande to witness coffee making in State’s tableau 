French President Francois Hollande, who will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi, will witness the various stages of coffee making in Karnataka’s tableau.The State’s tableau this year is on the theme: Kodagu: the coffee heaven of Karnataka. It will depict various stages in the making of coffee, starting from women plucking the beans to processing them and the processed powder being finally turned into the aromatic brew. The tableau depicts Kodava women, wearing their distinctive dress, performing their traditional dance.Folklorist H.L. Nage Gowda’s book Bettadinda Battalige (From the hills to the cup), on the coffee’s origin, is the basis for the tableau.Shashidhara Adapa, who designed the tableau, said the work on it has commenced both in Bengaluru and New Delhi. Two sets of artists are working on creating sculptures and fabricating the tableau. “Steam emanating from a cup of coffee will be visible to the audience,” he said. The signature music will be by Praveen D. Rao.It is for the sixth consecutive time that Karnataka is participating in the parade. Back in 2005, its tableau on the theme of Gomateshwara had bagged the first prize. In the subsequent years, the State showcased Mysuru Dasara, followed by Hoysala and Pattadkal architecture.According to N. Vishu Kumar, Director of the Department of Information, the selection process is rigorous. “Only the best are chosen,” he said. Getting an opportunity to represent the State at the parade is an achievement in itself, he added.
