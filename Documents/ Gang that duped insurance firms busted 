The Crime Branch has busted a gang that lodged false motor vehicle theft reports in Delhi to raise multiple insurance claims on the same car.The crime came to light a few days ago when the police laid a trap in Daryaganj on learning that one person would arrive there in a stolen car.Ashiq Chaudhary was nabbed with a Hyundai i10 car and upon verification, it turned out that the car was displaying a fake number plate.The car had been reported stolen several weeks ago. Police then picked up the threads from there and stumbled upon a well-planned modus operandi to cheat insurance companies.Police said that Chaudhary had first reported the theft of that car at Geeta Colony police station in 2013. “Once the case was closed as untraced, he claimed an insurance of Rs 5.7 lakh from HDFC Insurance Company,” said Ravindra Yadav, Joint CP (Crime).“After that, Ashiq brought out his car and got it released on superdari illegally by concealing the facts from the court,” the officer added.Once done with the formalities, Ashiq allegedly connived with his brother-in-law Amar Chaudhary and got the car’s ownership transferred in his name.In July last year, they again reported the car to be stolen. The theft was investigated and closed after which they obtained an insurance of Rs 3.4 lakh from Reliance Insurance Company.Police said that the nabbed suspect has admitted to having lodged another false theft of a Swift Dzire car.An insurance amount of Rs 5.69 lakh was realized by them from HDFC Insurance Company in this case. This vehicle too has been recovered by the police.Police said they suspect Ashiq and his brother-in-law to be involved in more frauds using the same modus operandi.
