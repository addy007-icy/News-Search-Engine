CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan has said that all mining activity should be in the public sector.Mr. Vijayan told The Hindu here that exclusive government control over mining of minor minerals would, in particular, ensure that there is no indiscriminate exploitation of the resources. This, he pointed out, would also help bring down their prices.“Now the prices are high because those who do the mining have to make underhand payments to get licences and carry on their activities,” he said
