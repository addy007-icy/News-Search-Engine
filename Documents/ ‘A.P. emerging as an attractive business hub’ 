Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan’s speech at the Republic Day celebrations here on Tuesday missed key issues that hit the headlines.In fact, the speech seemed to have not been updated as there was no mention of the much-proclaimed success of the government at the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos.The Governor said: “The Sate government succeeded in grabbing the eyeballs of the investors at the CII Partnership Summit held recently in Visakhapatnam by attracting an investment of about Rs. 4.7 lakh crore.”However, there was no mention of the government’s success in attracting MNCs at Davos.Mr. Narasimhan did, however, say that Andhra Pradesh emerged as the second best place for ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the World Bank rankings of States in the country announced in September 2015.The Governor’s speech had no mention of the progress in the police department.Usually, governments clear the air on the threat perception from terrorists and Maoists, and efforts to strengthen the security forces.Mr. Narasimhan said that though the agriculture sector suffered a setback due to deficit rainfall, the allied sectors such as fisheries and livestock registered an impressive growth.He listed the government’s initiatives such as Panta Sanjeevini, interlinking of rivers, free power, Rythu Sadhikaraka Sanstha, and Chandranna Rythu Kshetram, Rythu Kosam.But the speech had no mention of loan waiver to the farm sector and the SHGs.The issue assumes importance as the farmers are aggrieved. The bankers, on the other hand, are cautious in sanctioning loans to farmers after the implementation of the debt redemption scheme.Similar is the case with the SHGs. The speech was also silent on the government’s turnaround on the sand policy. Initially, the government involved DWCRA groups in sand mining stating that it was a move to empower women. Later, it decided to go for auction of the sand reaches stating that the DWCRA groups could not live up to the expectations.The Governor, referring to the livelihood programme for women, said: “New initiatives such as Anna Sanjeevani (generic medical shops to be run by mandal samakhyas), entrusting of maintenance of toilets in schools to SHGs, opening of 1,059 food joints, and promotion of branded products are benefiting women.”It, however, is silent on issues such as ‘success’ at Davos meet, loan waiver to farmers and SHGs, sand policy, etc.
