Former West Indies captain Chris Gayle was fined but avoided suspension for making inappropriate comments to a female reporter during a live TV interview during a Big Bash League Twenty20 match in Australia.Gayle was fined $10,000 Australian dollars ($7,300).“It was done in jest but it’s inappropriate,” Renegades chief executive Stuart Coventry said. “We had a look at some history and ... we think that this is a one-off scenario.”Coventry said Gayle was “quite surprised” when informed of the fine, which will be donated to charity.Sutherland said that as the Renegades had sanctioned Gayle, the veteran batsman would not face further action from Cricket Australia for this incident.
