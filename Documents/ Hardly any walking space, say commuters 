Like the other stations along the 10-km stretch between Koyambedu and Alandur, Ekkatuthangal too suffers from various problems, including lack of adequate space for footpath; no skywalk or subways and lack of sufficient signage.Located on arterial Inner Ring Road, this station requires a skywalk or a subway to enable commuters to reach the other side of the road but as neither exists, commuters are struggling. H. Hariraman, a commuter, said: “This is the first time I have used this service. Though I appreciate the way stations and trains are maintained, there are no skywalks or subways. Should we jump over the median?”He also said the road was congested during peak hours and there is hardly any space for commuters when they get off the station. “We have to walk very close to buses and motorists. They should have adequate footpath space too. We are scared we may be hit by a vehicle,” he added.According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), though there are plans to have more signages in place soon, increasing the footpath space may be difficult. “We had to cater to this facility only with the available space. It is a very challenging situation for us,” an official said. This station has a minimum passenger traffic of about 1,600 a day, he added.
