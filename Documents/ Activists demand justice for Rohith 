Scores of activists on Friday staged a protest demanding the resignation of Union Ministers Smriti Irani, Bandaru Dattatreya and Hyderabad University Vice-Chancellor over the issue of Dalit student Rohith Vemula’s suicide.While students affiliated to the National Students Union of India (NSUI) marched towards the HRD Ministry, a group of teachers and intellectuals from various institutions in the Capital came together for a protest at Jantar Mantar.The NSUI protest march was stopped at the Raisina Road when the protestors were on their way to the HRD Minister's residence and detained.“Revocation of suspension is not the demand of students. We want the immediate resignation of Smriti Irani, Dattatreya and Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao,” National Student Union of India (NSUI) president Roji John said.Accusing the Union government and the BJP leadership of “politicising” the matter, Mr. John said the protests would be “intensified” across the country. Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also joined the protesters.According to police, the protesters were detained as they tried to push the barricades and that the situation could have gone out of hands subsequently.Around 60 persons were detained and were later let off by the police.In another protest that was organised at Jantar Mantar, Janhastakshep and Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum (PMSF) came together.The protest was attended by a large number of senior faculty members of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lady Hardinge Medical College who spoke about the “callous” attitude of the Central government and the university administration which led to the Dalit student’s suicide.Later, a delegation under the leadership of Justice Rajinder Sachar submitted a memorandum to the President in this regard.
