The Indian women’s cricket team produced a superb allround performance to chase down a record total and upstage World champion Australia by five wickets in the opening Twenty20 International of a three-match series here on Tuesday.Electing to bowl, the Indians did well to restrict Australia to 140, before romping home in 18.4 overs.In the process, the Indian women managed to chase down the biggest victory target against the mighty Aussies, who were the odds-on favourites for the match.The series now moves to Melbourne for the second game on Friday followed by game three in Sydney on Sunday.The decision to put the Aussies in was proved right early on for India captain Mithali Raj when the home side was reduced to 17 for two.However, debutant opener Beth Mooney’s run-a-ball 36 followed by an entertaining knock of unbeaten 41 by Alyssa Healy lower down the order helped Australia post 140 for five.The Aussies were in a spot of bother before Healy’s 15-ball blitzkrieg, which included five 4s and a couple of sixes.For India, leg-spinner Poonam Yadav was the top wicket-taker, scalping two for 26 in her four overs.Veteran pacer Jhulan Goswami, Shikha Pandey and Anuja Patil picked up a wicket each in a consistently tight bowling performance.In reply, the Indians were not off to the best of starts as skipper and experienced batsman Mithali Raj (4), who opened the innings, was dismissed early.However, the rest of the top-order batsmen did their job well enough with Player-of-the-Match Harmanpreet Kaur standing out with a 31-ball 46, which was laced with half a dozen fours and a six.Smriti Mandhana (29) and Veda Krishnamurthy (36) were the other notable contributors in a fine chase.For Australia, left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen grabbed two wickets for 24 runs in three overs.After the T20Is, the teams will play a three-match ODI series early next month.The scores: Australia 140 for five in 20 overs (Beth Mooney 36, Alyssa Healy 41, Poonam Yadav two for 26) lost to India 141 for five in 18.4 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 46, Smriti Mandhana 29, Veda Krishnamurthy 36, Jess Jonassen two for 24).
