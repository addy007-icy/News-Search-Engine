A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to file within a week an affidavit explaining the action taken on the preliminary report exonerating Excise Minister K. Babu in the bar bribery case.The Bench comprising Chief Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice A.M. Shaffique also ordered the VACB to state in the affidavit whether the preliminary report had been submitted to the Vigilance court and the steps taken thereafter.Public interest pleaThe court issued the directives when a public interest writ petition filed by CPI MLA V.S. Sunilkumar, seeking a CBI probe into the case, came up for hearing. According to the petitioner, Biju Ramesh, working president of Kerala State Bar and Restaurant Ownersâ€™ Association, while giving statements under Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code before the magistrate, had levelled bribery charges against Mr. Babu. The petitioner sought a directive to the VACB to register a crime against Mr. Babu based on the statement of Mr. Biju Ramesh.Queries to AGWhen the petition came up for hearing, the court asked Advocate General (AG) K.P. Dandapani, who appeared for the VACB, whether any order or follow-up action had been taken after receiving the preliminary report.The court also asked the AG why there was a delay of six months in filing the report before the Vigilance court. The AG then submitted that as several litigations in the bar bribery case had been pending before various courts, all the details could not be brought on record before the court.No prima facie caseIn an affidavit, the VACB had stated that no prima facie case had been established in the preliminary inquiry so as to register an FIR against the Excise Minister. The allegations against Mr. Babu were fully based on hearsay.
