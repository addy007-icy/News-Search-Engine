The police said that the duo, after killing the aged couple, waited for Durga’s husband Manikantan (34), a lab technician. They attacked him after he discovered his parents’ bodies, but he managed to escape and alert the police.Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East), M.B. Boralingaiah, said that Durga had met Anji, her relative and fell in love with him. The duo had also eloped to AP, a few months ago and returned after Manikantan traced them and convinced her to return.Late on Sunday night, Kannan reprimanded Durga when he found Anji at home. Enraged, the duo attacked him with a machete. “In order to conceal their crime, they hid Kannan’s body under the cot.” After sometime, they hacked Manoramani to death when she returned home. “When Manikantan returned home and found blood on the floor, Durga attacked him,” he added.
