Budget carrier GoAir, whose fleet expansion plans were affected after European aircraft maker Airbus recently indicated a potential delay in the delivery schedule for A320 Neos, is likely to get clarity on the matter in two weeks, airline sources said on Sunday.The Wadia-promoted airline was to induct these fuel-efficient aircraft from the next fiscal, but due to some “industrial reasons” the aircraft maker had indicated a potential delay in the delivery of these planes.“Airbus is expected to get back to us on the issue of A320 Neo (new engine option) plane this month, which will clear the air about its delivery schedule,” the sources said here, expressing hope that some firm communication from Airbus in this regard would come around January 15.The budget carrier was supposed to have 26 Airbus A320 Neos by end of 2017. GoAir had, in June 2011, placed order for 72 new A320 neos, valued at about Rs. 32,400 crore on list price, with Airbus.Airline spokesperson was not available for comments.GoAir had late last year said that deliveries of these planes were likely to be pushed back by 3-4 months. As per the earlier schedule, the planes were set to start joining the fleet from April this year.One of the top three low-cost carriers, GoAir had 9.2 per cent market share in November last year.GoAir, which is the second profitable carrier after the IndiGo, currently has 19 A320s in the fleet operating 144 daily flights across 22 domestic destinations.
