The hospitals have submitted a schedule for upgradation and ensuring that the mortuaries including the oldest at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital is following the norms.A senior official at Aruna Asif Ali, however, maintained that “work pressure, short staff, and the extensive work needed in the hospital’s mortuary had resulted in the slow down of the revival process.”“What to talk of the deceased, here the living are treated in such a callous manner. According to the concept of universal precautions, all human blood and body components and other potentially infectious material are treated and handled as if known for HIV, HBV and other blood-borne pathogens. At many hospitals the staff is forced to turn a blind eye to this basic precaution and that is a reflection of the problem at hand,” noted a senior health official here.Advocate Saqib explained that the court had directed the Delhi Government to ensure that supply of materials and other consumables required at the mortuary are timely complied with and requisition made by the mortuary authorities be attended with promptness and urgency so that dignity of dead bodies is maintained.“Now these hospitals need to submit the work undertaken and its completion. Timely compliance needs to be checked. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the NDMC have shown their eagerness in undertaking various measures for improving the facilities at mortuaries in Delhi. However, much requires to be done on the ground level. The issue pertaining to hygiene and health of mortuary employees also needs immediate attention,” he added.
