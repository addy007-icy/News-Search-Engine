ith human errors and bad driving accounting for majority of accidents, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) is turning its attention to the functioning of driving schools.Enforcement officials in the district said that there were any number of driving schools, which continue to give training in outdated vehicles without even basic features such as seat belts and handbrakes.Though an instructor trained in Industrial Training Institute is a prerequisite for securing licence, many driving schools thereafter hire people who are hardly qualified for imparting driving lessons. “They have no knowledge about the mechanics behind vehicles and road safety. For instance, these tutors have no idea about the crucial lane traffic rules and those who emerge from such schools are also ignorant about it,” said a senior MVD official.Rule 24 (3) (iii) of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules prescribes that driving schools should have adequate provision for conducting lectures, demonstration, and adequate parking area for vehicles meant for instructions.After finding that many driving schools failed to comply with these provisions, the transport commissionerate issued a circular in September 2013 directing the licensing authority to enforce minimum space as required under CMV Rule 24 (3) (ii), which laid down specific size for lecture hall, demonstration hall, and parking space besides the office space.It also prescribed additional qualifications for trainers. However, the circular exempted existing driving schools till the time of the renewal of their licence, which becomes due every five years.This was followed by another circular in November 2014, which laid down ten directions aimed at improving the quality of training at driving schools.K.S. Cheriyan, secretary, All Kerala Motor Driving Schools Association, said that circulars can hardly withstand legal scrutiny. “They cannot arbitrarily bring about additional conditions for driving schools. Anyway, if there are driving schools operating in violation of norms, then Regional Transport Officers, who are the licensing authorities, should be held responsible,” he said.Dejo Kappen, a transportation expert, calls for recording the driving test and a random test of those who clears the test by an independent agency to crosscheck how qualified they are.
