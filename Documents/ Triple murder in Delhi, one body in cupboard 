Three members of the same family — a middle aged couple and their young son — were found murdered at their residence in Old Rajinder Nagar in New Delhi on Sunday morning.Police suspect personal enmity to be the motive behind the triple murder. While the bodies of Jyoti (48) and Pawan (21) were spotted by the domestic help who came to report for duty on Sunday morning, the third body was located by the police upon reaching the crime scene.The lag, initially, led the police to suspect that Jyoti’s husband Sanjay (51) had murdered the duo and absconded. That possibility, however, was negated when upon inspection, Sanjay’s body was also found stuffed in the cupboard.The house was found ransacked but police sources said robbery did not seem to be the motive.Joint Commissioner of Police (Central) S.K. Gautam who visited the third floor residence where the family lived in Rajinder Nagar said the three were strangulated and it was likely that the murders were committed on Saturday evening itself.Sanjay worked with the Sales Tax department and also ran a property business while Pawan was a mechanical engineering student studying in Rohini’s Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology.A Police officer added that Pawan's body was on the bed with its hands tied up while his mother was lying on the floor.Sanjay's body was found in the cupboard in an adjoining room.Sanjay had been suspended a few months ago and his suspension had not been revoked till now.Rani Verma, known to Jyoti's maternal family, who visited the spot claimed that before he died last August, Jyoti's father-in-law had left some property in her name which irked some of her other in-laws.
