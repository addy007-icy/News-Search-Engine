Sensing potential in children as social entrepreneurs, Puducherry-based NGO Trust for Youth and Child Leadership has announced an initiative ‘Children’s Incubation House’ which will tap into their creativity.“The incubation house will create a space for children to explore their exceptional innovation for social change. It will act as a resource centre for children to mould their ideas into action for the well-being of people and the planet,” said Siva Mathiyazhagan, founder, TYCL.TYCL is currently supporting three projects initiated by children of Baby Sarah Home, Ariyankuppam which are Nalam Valam (cycle tour in the villages) by Magesh, Jenanam (blood donor club) by Sivaranjini and Magizhmathi (eco-house garden) by Subalakshmi.Children interested in the initiative must be between 10 to 18 years old (relaxation of three years in age for those with learning disability) and belong to Puducherry and its bio-regions, said TYCL.The incubation house was launched at the Child Leader Awards organised by NGOs Mughil and TYCL this month.
