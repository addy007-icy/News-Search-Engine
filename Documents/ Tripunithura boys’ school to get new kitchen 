The Government Boysâ€™ School, Tripunithura, will get a new kitchen and mess hall soon as work has begun for the same.The last remnants of the 108-old school structure were razed to the ground two days ago. While the work is on, there is however, confusion among the school authorities as to what construction is happening on their premises.There are apprehensions that the school may lose the large ground as there are rumours about a mini stadium and a B.Ed college also coming up on the premises.While the Tripunithura Municipality is the local government for the school and the previous council had decided about the new building, the classrooms for B.Ed college will be decided later, said Chandrika Devi, Municipal chairperson.
