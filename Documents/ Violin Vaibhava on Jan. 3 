The different styles and approaches of the violin in classical Carnatic will be showcased in Violin Vaibhava – 2016, which will be held at Basavanagudi on January 3. The new generation of musical talent — namely students — will present diverse musical classical styles.Strung together creatively by the Lalgudi Trust and Krutagnya, and run by the fifth generation of the Lalgudi family of violinists G.J.R. Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi, the event is a tribute to the Western instrument that is intrinsic to Indian music today.Lalgudi’s stylistic interpretations necessarily bore an influence on other styles too, but never failed to recognise the other bowing techniques that added to the rich repository of creative interpretations. “As Karnataka showcases inimitable styles from time-honoured gurus, we wanted to showcase some of their students,” says G.J.R. Krishnan.Starting with the legendary T. Chowdiah, who had innovated on his seven-stringed violin nearly seven decades ago, to T.S. Krishnamurthy, who continued the tradition, and later Mahadevappa, who propagated his popular play and passed them on to sons Nagaraj and Manjunath, to the effervescent present generation of violinists represented by H.K. Venkatram, Kumaresh and Vittal Ramamurthy, the styles that evolved have their unique signature. The event will be held from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. at H.N. Multimedia Hall, National College, Basavanagudi.
