Accessible, affordable, quality and safe healthcare to the community at large with special emphasis on rural and semi urban areas are the new areas of focus that have been identified by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to work with the Health Ministry.IMA national president Dr. S. S. Agarwal speaking to the media noted that IMA with its 1,700 local branches, 30 State branches and 2.5 lakh doctors will be able to “reach anywhere in the country from remote areas including North-East, deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, tribal areas of Jharkhand and Chattisgarh to the terror-hit areas of Kashmir and Naxalite areas of the country.’’IMA has noted that it was willing to provide its massive infrastructure to be incorporated in various national health programmes for providing healthcare delivery.“Any national health programme launched by the government, should not only involve the government but also incorporate the private sector,” noted Dr. Agarwal.IMA is also offering its infrastructure to link adolescent clinics with the non-clinical awareness programme.
