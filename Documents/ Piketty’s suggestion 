French economist Thomas Piketty has rightly pointed out that the elite have to pay more tax on wealth (“Tax elite to reduce inequality”, Jan. 22). He suggests that the aim should be to bring the tax-to-GDP ratio, less than 11 per cent now, to 30-50 per cent. In India, it is incredible how many of the elite evade payment of taxes. If they are taxed properly, we need not invite FDI and other international loans. More than 23 per cent of our budget allotment goes towards debt payment. It should be reduced. We may have increased the number of millionaires in our country, but we haven’t substantially reduced the number of people below the poverty line.R.S. Lal Mohan,Nagercoil
