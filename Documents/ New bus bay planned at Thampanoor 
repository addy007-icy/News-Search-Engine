The district administration has given approval for the construction of a bus bay near the overbridge at Thampanoor. The Kerala Road Fund Board will take up construction of a bus bay which will accommodate five buses at a time.The bus shelter will come up on the stretch from Chaithram Hotel to S.S. Kovil Road junction. The facility will come up on eight cents of land which was given on lease to the owners of the Sreekumar-Sreevisakh theatre complex for providing parking facility for movie-goers.“The lease ended in 2007 and we have decided to take back the land for constructing the bus shelter. It’s a highly congested place and construction of bus shelter has become essential to streamline traffic on a busy stretch like Thampanoor,” said a senior official with the district administration.There was bit resistance from the theatre owners to the move.Revenue officials inspect spotA team of revenue officials led by District Collector Biju Prabhakar on Sunday inspected the spot and made it clear to the management about its decision to use the land for providing better facility for passengers.According to the official, movie-goers could utilise the parking lot inside the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation bus terminal-cum-complex. “The management’s concerns about lack of space for parking are unfounded as they could direct people to park their vehicles inside the complex, which is just a few metres away,” the official added. The bus bay will cater to the needs of commuters travelling within the city. The buses starting from East Fort and proceeding to Pappanamcode, Balaramapuram, and Karamana areas will have stops at the bay.
