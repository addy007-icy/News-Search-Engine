As the world flocks towards Iran, it can only be counterproductive for India to continue with its prosaic policy of “patient waiting” (“Delays disappointing, Indian policy needs to change: Iran”, Jan.21). New Delhi needs to keep in mind that Iran’s economic and strategic utility for India is almost unparalleled. Economically it can open inaccessible markets and provide our firms new business. Iran’s geographic location across our northwestern borders can boost Afghanistan’s efforts to ensure peace. It is time India fast-tracks the stalled projects and Prime Minister Narendra Modi sets foot on the “Persian carpet”.Shashank Jain,Delhi
