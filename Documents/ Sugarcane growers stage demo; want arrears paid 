Kannan said that sugar mills had not paid the procurement price fixed by the State government for the past two years.Even as the government had fixed the procurement price at Rs. 2,600, the mills preferred to offer only Rs. 1900.The government should intervene and direct the mills to settle the dues and pay the price as per government norms.A majority of private mills delayed settlement of arrears amounting to Rs. 300 crore, he added.‘MSP for 2016’The government had not announced the MSP for 2016. It should convene a meeting and announce it immediately, he urged.
