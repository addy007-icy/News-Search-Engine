Most of the deaths happen due to rash driving, negligence and violating traffic rules, Mr. Cholan said.Terming such deaths a great loss to the society and the nation, Mr. Cholan said that the youngstersâ€™ passion for vehicle driving should not cost them their lives.Therefore, the youth and the students should not consider traffic rules as a bane and enjoy safe driving by following those rules, Mr. Cholan said.Superintendent of Police Dharmendra Kumar Meena, who released road safety stickers, said that police records indicated that 95 per cent road accident deaths happen due to head injuries. Wearing helmets was made compulsory for motorcycle riders for safety reasons.
