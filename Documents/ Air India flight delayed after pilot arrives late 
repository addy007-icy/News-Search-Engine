Passengers of an Air India Delhi-Bhubaneswar flight was delayed by more than two hours on Monday after the flight’s pilot reportedly arrived late. This is the second incident in four days when an Air India flight has been delayed for reasons other than technical or weather-related.The Air India flight (AI 75) was scheduled to depart from Delhi at 11 a.m. and reach Bhubaneswar at 1.15 pm. The flight, however, could leave Delhi only after 1.45 pm, once the crew arrived.Among the passengers who were stranded inside the aircraft for more than two hours were Justice D. Murugesan, member of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), and three other senior officials of the commission.Justice Murugesan was going to chair a workshop on ‘Elimination of Bonded Labour’ in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday.“The fact that the crew was not available was not revealed to the passengers even as they checked-in on time and boarded the flight. The passengers were also not allowed to go out of the aircraft or even move around inside,” a source said.“All passengers had to face great inconvenience. Only after the passengers protested were they told that the crew was yet to arrive,” the source added.A senior Air India official said that the reason the crew was late was that they were flying another aircraft that arrived late in Delhi.“Our crew members operate four flights on average a day and if one landing is delayed, it affects the consequent flights also,” he said.Last Friday, another Air India flight to Bhubanesar was delayed after the airline allegedly provided the aircraft and crew of that plane for its Bhopal flight, in which some VIPs were reportedly travelling.An Air India official said the crew was late because itwas flying another aircraft thatwas delayed
