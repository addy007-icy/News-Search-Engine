G. Rupa Devi wouldn’t have expected a better start to 2016. The world football’s governing body, FIFA, selected her to officiate in international matches.A native of Dindigul district, she started playing football at the age of six. The Dindigul District Football association (DDFA) helped her participate in various National-level tournaments and also sponsored her education.After representing in junior levels, Rupa made her way into the State team. In 2010-11, Rupa lost her parents.With no competitive matches happening at the National level, she decided to become a referee in 2012. She has been doing the job since then at the State and National levels.Rupa was chosen by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 2013, for the under-14 football festival held in Doha.Teams from Bahrain, Qatar, Palestine, UAE and Jordan took part. She was the only Indian referee to be a part of the Asian body’s “Future referees project” at that time. Three years later, she qualified as an international referee.Rupa said: “It was a good news to get at the start of the year. My next stop is the Rio Olympics. I would like to officiate there. It would be great to have a football academy in Tamil Nadu for referees.”S. Shanmugham, Secretary, DDFA, said: “Rupa has worked really hard to reach this position and the government should give her a job as she badly needs one.”
