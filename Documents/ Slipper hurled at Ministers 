The TRS was saved from a major public embarrassment when a disgruntled advocate aimed a slipper at Telangana Ministers including K.T. Rama on Tuesday. The offending object missed its mark.According to eyewitnesses, the advocate Madhusudan Rao hurled the slipper on to the dais soon after Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Rao finished addressing a gathering in Amberpet. The slipper landed just inches away from IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao. Transport Minister Mahender Reddy was also present there. The police soon escorted the advocate out of the function hall while the Ministers called out to the security personnel to let him go. Police took him to Amberpet police station and later released him.
