In view of a veiled threat to linguistic harmony and peace in Belagavi over the impending release of Marathi film “Marathi Tigers”, scheduled for February 5, the State government is considering various options to deal with it.Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patil, who has been recently appointed in-charge of the boundary dispute, told The Hindu on Saturday that the government would take action as per law if the film sparked off any violence and harmed the prevailing linguistic harmony and peace.Regional Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Belagavi N. Jayaram also expressed similar views and did not rule out the possibility of recommending to the government to ban the film, even as a direction has been issued to the police authorities and sub-divisional magistrates of Belagavi and Chikkodi to take precautionary measures against possible untoward incidents in the event of the film being screened in the city and other parts of the district.Meanwhile, Karnataka Navanirman Sena leader Bheema Shankar Patil is stated to have filed a public interest litigation plea in the High Court of Karnataka seeking a stay on the release of film as it focussed on the sensitive boundary dispute and could foment trouble in boundary areas of the State. Also, Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee president Ashok Chandargi pointed out that the trailers of the film clearly depicted Yellur incidents, even as the matter was being heard by the National Human Rights Commission following a complaint from a Maharashtra-based politician Vinod Tavade. The film also suggested that no reply by Karnataka was submitted to the NHRC notice, while the boundary dispute was still before the Supreme Court.Significantly, the Deputy Commissioner of Police Anupam Agarwal held a meeting with senior leaders of Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti Malojirao Ashtekar and Deepak Dalvi and appealed them to advise those who were pro-Maharashtra to desist from circulating provocative messages vis-a-vis the film on social media.He told them that the messages being posted on various social media had the potential of harming linguistic harmony and peace.
