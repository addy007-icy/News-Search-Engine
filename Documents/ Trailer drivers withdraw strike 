Container movement to the Chennai Port Trust re-commenced on Saturday after trailer drivers and cleaners agreed to withdraw their strike.Drivers had struck work on Thursday evening refusing to budge from the Ennore Expressway till the inordinate delays in movement of containers inside the port came to an end. “They have agreed to move 48 containers in an hour, which will help bring down our waiting time. It often takes us over 24 hours just to cover 3 km… vehicles waiting to enter the port move inch by inch and drivers won’t even be able to have lunch or get off the vehicles,” said E. Kalimuthu, secretary, Chennai Thuraimuga AITUC Tractor Trailer Articulated Drivers Cleaners and Thozhilalar Sangam.Trailers meant for both import and export stand in one queue on the Ennore Expressway. Sometimes, trailer drivers try to break out of line by bribing policemen. It also leads to accidents since other vehicles fight for space.“Even on Tuesday, two persons on a two-wheeler died on the spot when a van hit them. The road is narrow in certain stretches where widening has not been carried out,” said V. Rajkumar, a resident of Tiruvottiyur.
