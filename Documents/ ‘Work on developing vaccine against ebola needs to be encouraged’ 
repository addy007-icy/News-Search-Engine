India’s growing footprint in Africa makes it imperative to take the Ebola epidemic seriously and work for a vaccine. Besides, the research can also be a platform technology to develop vaccines against other diseases in India but very little work on it was being done, according to a veterinary biologist who is part of a team working on developing a vaccine for Ebola virus in India.Nagendra Hegde, Associate Director of the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech told The Hindu at the Indian Science Congress that their effort was probably the first of its kind in the country and they have established the proof of concept for the development of vaccine.“What we have done is developed a vaccine based on another virus which is not Ebola, but it produces protein and provides immune response. This has been tested on mice and the preliminary proof of concept established,” said Dr. Hegde.It has to be tested whether it protects in case of non-human primates and will have to be subjected to challenging study in non-human primates, before it can go for other pre-clinical tests like toxicology tests, he added.This will take a few years, besides crores of rupees, but the government should be prepared in the eventuality of an outbreak in India, as Ebola virus disease has no known cure, and, like rabies, results in imminent death, said Dr. Hegde.The company has entered into an MoU with the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Hyderabad, and hopes that it can secure funding to take forward the project. This will also act as a platform technology for other diseases , according to Dr. Hegde. India should be concerned because infectious diseases spread easily.
