Tree climbing is no longer a tough task, thanks to bamboo ladders made by Koya tribe of the Papi hill range.The ladder is made of bamboo that tribals are entitled to collect from forest. The branches of the log are used as steps. One person should be on the ground, maintaining the balance of the ladder, enabling the climber to rest on it to tap toddy, according to Koya tree climbers at Sivagiri hamlet of Polavaram mandal in West Godavari district.Koya tribal tree climbers are of the view that the ladder is an important tool to cut toddy leaves which are used in bamboo houses. “The bamboo ladder is not a modern innovation. It really reduces the risk involved in tree climbing and minimises the high incidence of fall,” ITDS director G. Anil Kumar said.Since majority of bamboo houses in the Papi hill range require toddy leaves, the profession is desperately in need of safe tools such as the ladder. Ironically, a slip from a tree could always spell death for toddy-tree climbers in plain areas in the absence of safe tools.
