Negligence, dearth of funds and poor management are apparently reasons for spurt in canine population and stray dogbite cases. The civic authorities are hardly taking necessary steps to control the canine population in the cities and towns.The death of Ananya brought to fore the poor state of affairs in civic bodies in the State. A year ago, a toddler Syam was severely injured in a dog attack at Kabela Centre. A six-year-old girl was killed by a pack of 10 stray dogs in Kakumanu of Guntur district recently. In another incident, canines mauled a 20-month-old child to death in Visakhapatnam in September last when the child had come out of his house to play. Strangely enough, officials have not learnt lessons from the past. The VMC stopped sterilisation of stray dogs in 2009, citing fund crunch and lack of facilities. Canine population in the city has gone up significantly since then. The corporation had then pegged stray dog population at 10,000. It claimed of “successfully conducting” ovario-hysterectomy and surgical castration on dogs, adding that more than 7,000 dogs had undergone the surgeries. In phase-I, 3,000 canines were sterilised, while the rest were covered in phase-II. Though it was announced that sterilisation would be taken up every year, the authorities have hardly kept their word.
