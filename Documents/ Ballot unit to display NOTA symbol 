Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), which would be used in the Assembly elections in the State, would display the new symbol for the ‘None of the Above (NOTA)’ option in the ballot unit.The cross mark symbol designed by the Ahmedabad-based National Institute of Design (NID) was introduced by the Election Commission (EC) in September last year and was used in polls conducted thereafter. This would be the first time, the symbol would be used in polls in Tamil Nadu, officials said.Over 5.68 lakh voters (about 1.4 per cent of the total electorate) from Tamil Nadu had pressed the ‘NOTA’ button during the Parliamentary polls in May 2014.

Also, the cross mark symbol would be the last symbol below the last symbol of the last candidate, official sources said.Stationery procurementOfficials are in the process of procuring stationery for the polls. “We have called for a tender notification on January 8 and we expect to procure the material within two months.
