Additional Commissioner of the Excise Department, A. S. Vishwarupa, has said that the department was considering improving the promotional opportunities for the excise guards by creating new posts of Head Guards and Assistant Sub- inspectors.Speaking at a function to mark the conclusion of the four-month long foundation training programme to 279 newly recruited and existing excise guards at the Police Training College in Naganagalli near here on Saturday, Mr. Vishwarupa admitted that there was a widespread resentment among the excise guards about the nomenclature of their posts and lack of promotional opportunities for them.“Even in revenue mobilisation, in which the Excise Department occupies the second place after commercial taxes, the role of excise guards is very important to prevent revenue leakages,” Mr. Vishwarupa said.Inspector-general of Police (Training) Alok Kumar said that the training to the guards was very important to sharpen their skills.“… Everybody who wears the khakhi dress is equal…their duties and power may be different, but their role to ensure that the law of the land is not violated is equally important.”The contributions of the men in khakhi, irrespective of their posts, has not gone unnoticed, he said.He further said that a circle in Bengaluru city has been named as ‘Meese Thimmaiah Circle’ recognising the services of a traffic constable, who died while discharging his duties in the same circle.
