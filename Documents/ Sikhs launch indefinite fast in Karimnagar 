Parents of software engineer Sardar Balwinder Singh, who was gunned down by police when he went berserk with a sword last month, launched indefinite fast along with Sikh community leaders demanding stern action against the police officials responsible, in front of the Collectorate in Karimnagar on Monday.The software engineerâ€™s parents -- Avataar Singh and Sathwant Kaur -- along with municipal corporator Kamaljit Kaur and others demanded that the police should register IPC 302 case against Karimnagar Inspector Vijaysaradhi and head constable Mallaiah. They also found fault with the police officials for not initiating any disciplinary action against the inspector who opened fire unnecessarily from a close range and caused the death of Balwinder Singh when there were other methods to nab. They reiterated that Balwinder Singh had not harmed any civilians with the sword and he had only attacked his parents and slit his own hand out of frustration.
