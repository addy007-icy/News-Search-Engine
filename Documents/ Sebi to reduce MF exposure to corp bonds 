Sebi is mulling urgent steps to safeguard investors’ interest against any overexposure of mutual funds to riskier corporate bonds, while measures are also underway to allow sale of funds on e-commerce platforms to provide an easy and cost-effective channel. The regulator’s board is expected to meet on Monday to deliberate on this issue.The proposed move to allow the fund houses and their distributors to sell mutual fund schemes through e-commerce platforms is expected to benefit all stakeholders including the investors.At the same time, Sebi is considering reducing the sector exposure limits for debt schemes to address concerns over the risks associated with their investments in distressed corporate bonds, which recently came to fore after Amtek Auto crisis. Currently, the exposure limit is 30 per cent.It is also looking into additional guidelines for credit rating agencies with respect to rating procedures on such corporate bonds.The issue of reducing the MF exposure limit for debt schemes caught Sebi’s attention after JP Morgan Mutual Fund got into troubles due to its exposure to debt securities of Amtek Auto, while a few other fund houses have also faced similar problems with regard to corporate bonds of a few other distressed firms.—PTI
