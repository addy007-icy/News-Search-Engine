Acute resource crunch is reportedly forcing the Public Service Commission (PSC) to wind up its district offices and also alter the recruitment schedule, especially the selection to the uniformed forces due in February.Against a demand for Rs.46 crore for honouring the expenditure for the current year, the Finance Department has so far granted only a permission to re-appropriate Rs.6 crore from the funds left at the commission’s disposal and has also stopped releasing additional tranches as demanded earlier to meet its committed expenditure.Commission sources told The Hindu here that considering the mounting expenses on various counts, mainly the rent for the regional offices functioning from hired buildings and the payments due to schools and colleges taken for conducting various examinations, it has been proposed to rework the examination schedule and also, if left without other options, close down the regional offices.First casualtyThe first casualty of the financial crisis would be the recruitment of sub-inspectors, including 30 women sub-inspectors, women constables and various posts in Excise Department. For instance, about 5,000 candidates are expected to appear for the physical fitness test for selecting sub-inspectors alone. Since the commission has not cleared the arrears for hiring grounds to conduct the tests earlier, none of the government agencies or local governments would be providing the grounds within their purview for conducting the physical test. This would force the commission to defer the test till the government released funds, sources said.The commission could not pay the honorarium arrears due to invigilators, experts roped in for setting question papers and other staff in schools which were taken for conducting written examinations for various posts. Hence, most of the managements tend to decline the commission’s requests to provide their premises for holding examinations.Following the repeated requests of the commission, the Chief Minister had directed timely release of funds, but the Finance Department has not obliged so far. Already, the commission has initiated a series of austerity measures and is now seriously thinking to reduce the frequency of notification for recruitment to uniformed forces.The commission requires three to six months for conducting minor examinations and more than a year for completing the procedures for holding examinations involving a large number of candidates like the selection of lower division clerks.PSC examination schedule to be reworkedFirst casualty will be recruitment of sub inspectors
