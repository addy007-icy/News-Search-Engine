Soviet-made seventh Sindhughosh submarine of Indian Navy INS Sindhukirti, which underwent retrofitting at Hindustan Shipyard Limited, has successfully completed its maiden deep dive trials without any major defects. The vessel was delivered to the Navy in June after medium repairs and modernisation at HSL.The development is of great significance as it certifies the high quality of repairs carried on the hull and associated systems by trained and experienced workmen of HSL adhering to stringent quality norms.Though the yard took more time for refit than stipulated, it is worth mentioning that the retrofitting of INS Sindhukirti was the first of its kind undertaken by an Indian Shipyard with support from Indian Navy.Prime contenderHSL Chairman and Managing Director Rear Admiral L.V.S. Babu appreciated the HSL team for their commitment and quality work which resulted in defect-free first sortie and full power trials followed by clearance of ‘check dive’ and deep dive’ in the first attempt.He said this had placed the yard as a prime contender for undertaking Medium Refit Life Certification (MRLC) of EKM submarines, as well as for construction of Project P-75(I) submarines.Despite major devastation caused by Cyclone Hudhud, HSL had timely undocked the submarine on November 4, 2014 and completed harbour acceptance trials in record period of seven months due to synergised efforts between the yard and Naval Dockyard-Visakhapatnam) and other Naval agencies.
