In 2015, after formation of the Red Sanders Anti Smuggling Task Force , the felling of trees reduced to 6,000 (200 tonnes) and their worth was pegged at Rs.100 crore.The task force officials also seized 73 vehicles and nabbed 496 smugglers and operatives, including nine international smugglers.The Red Sanders Anti Smuggling Task Force operates with 436 police and forest officials and is headed by Deputy Inspector General of Police M.
