The Delhi government has cancelled the premature release request of Sushil Sharma, the former politician who burnt his wife’s body in a tandoor at a Delhi restaurant nearly 20 years ago. In 2013, the Supreme Court commuted to life imprisonment the death sentence awarded to Sharma. Sharma had asked for his sentence to be reduced last September, citing a law that allows a State government to set a prisoner free after serving 14 years in jail. He had argued in his appeal that he has already spent 20 years in prison.“The Delhi government has turned down his request. We didn’t find him fit for the recommendation,” confirmed Home Minister Satyendar Jain.The Delhi government’s Sentence Review Board recommends premature release after going through a convict’s jail conduct and parole reports. The Board had reviewed 103 cases this time. The Board has sent one case to the President, as the convict is terminally ill, two cases pertaining to CBI to the Central government, 38 cases to the Lieutenant-Governor and has rejected 62 pleas, including Sharma’s. Of the 41 pleas recommended by the Board, none include rapists. Every three months, the Board reviews applications and forwards them to the L-G. However, cases pertaining to the CBI are sent to the Centre.The Board comprises the Delhi Home Minister, the Home Secretary, the Law Secretary, a police official and a Magistrate.
