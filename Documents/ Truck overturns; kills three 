A mud-laden truck rammed a petrol pump in South Delhi and overturned on a car, killing its three occupants on the spot. It took around two hours before the last occupant of the car was brought out as the fire officials had to remove most of the overturned mud and then cut open the car using gas cutters. The truck with a Haryana-number plate also rammed a petrol dispensing machine, that was not functional at that time, but a possible blaze was averted. The driver escaped. The driver has been identified and police are searching for him after booking him for the incident. â€”Staff Reporter
