Tennis is widely revered and appreciated and thundering aces, long rallies and acrobatic volleys have long graced the game in no small measure. However, the recent allegations of match-fixing dent the unflinching love for the game in the hearts of many sports lovers. (“Report by media outlets claims big-time match-fixing in tennis”, Jan.19).
