The Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) will organise a high-level “Workshop on Anti-Human Trafficking” shortly, with no respite in the influx of loggers from Tamil Nadu who are engaged to fell red sanders trees in Seshachalam and Nallamala hills.the RSASTF head and DIG M. Kantha Rao told The Hindu that in spite of the efforts of the Task Force, police and forest officials, there had been a steady flow of woodcutters from the northern parts of Tamil Nadu. “The poverty-stricken people of these hilly areas are dumped into containers and lorries like animals and are being brought here by middlemen. We are going to conduct a high-level workshop on Anti-Human Trafficking issues, shortly,” he said, adding that the event would involve top officials of police, forest, transport and other vital wings of the government. The counterparts from Tamil Nadu would also be invited for the workshop.Referring to the red sanders smuggling, the official said the meistries (organisers of felling operations) and smugglers were forcibly getting the woodcutters from the hilly areas of Tamil Nadu by luring their family with money.“This clearly comes under human trafficking. We will take steps to prompt the police and forest officials to book the smugglers and meistries under Anti-human trafficking Act,” he said.
