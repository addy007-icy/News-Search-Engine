The delay in acquiring land has once again stalled the widening of Velachery Main Road in East Tambaram for a stretch of about 300 metres.A request to sanction Rs. 10.5 crore to the State Highways Department for enabling it to widen a 300-metre stretch between Poondi Bazaar and Convent bus stop, was sent many months ago to the State Government; but the Department is yet to receive the amount. The delay in widening the stretch is causing severe problems to residents.“There are 3 schools around this stretch and over 10,000 are studying in them. The sight of students running behind the speeding buses on the narrow stretch of this road is pathetic,” said S. Jayalakshmi of Camp Road. “There are no pavements and pedestrians share the limited space with other fast-moving vehicles,” pointed out K. Sridhar of Elangovan Street. As part of the widening programme, the State Highways Department removed encroachments and widened a portion of the road between Gowriwakkam and Mahalakshmi Nagar in 2014. But there has been no progress since then as the Department does not have funds. Officials said they required funds to demolish roadside properties and also for laying the road. “The estimation for this was calculated and sent for approval. Once we get administrative sanction, funds for the execution of project will be received,” an official said.
