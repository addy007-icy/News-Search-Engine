A portion of Chintadripet MRTS Station now wears a fresh look. Plants are being raised in plastic covers and traditional kolam adorns the shutters of the shops within the station. This facelift was given by Soundaryan, Saranya, Pon Sundar and Yamuna Sakthivel, who are final-year students of the School of Architecture and Planning, Anna University, Guindy.After being short-listed for the second-level of Westminster International Design Competition for their work at Kasturbha Nagar MRTS, they have taken up a similar project at Chintadripet MRTS premises. The objective of the competition is to revive some of the disused portions of public facilities.“This time, we chose Chintadripet MRTS Station as its premises is huge and looks deserted. It has a lot of space on the front portion and as it is located near Anna Salai, it is an important station.”“For Kasturbha Nagar MRTS, we collected discarded objects such as PVC pipes, vehicle tyres and ropes from individuals. For Chinthadripet, we visited a scrap yard on Old Mahabalipuram Road and bought metal poles, plates and tyres.”“At Kasthurba Nagar, local people showed interest and involved themselves in the work. They have a sense of ownership about the station. In contrast, in Chintadripet, most of the commuters are residents of other localities, and the officials showed interest and guided us.“According to their advice, we designed benches in such a way that people can only sit and not sleep on them. Also, the facility will not attract hawkers to spread their wares and encroach upon the space,” says Yamuna.
