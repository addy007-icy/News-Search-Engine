Group dance has evolved into the biggest crowd-puller of the State School Arts Festival. Proof of it was there at the Putharikandam Ground, the main venue of the 56th edition of the festival, on Saturday.Some 10,000 people watched the group dance competition for Higher Secondary girls. That has easily been the biggest turnout at this festival, which has not been anywhere near as crowded as the past few editions, held in places such as Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad and Thrissur.The dancers delighted the audience, with their stunningly beautiful costumes. Before they took over the stage, there were group dancers of another kind â€“ the Oppana.Another crowd favourite, the folk dance competition, for both boys and girls, was also held on Saturday. Kolkali, Parichamuttukali, mimicry, Arabanamuttu, Kerala Nadanam, Vattappattu, Ghazal, Koodiyattam, Kathakali, mono act, Maddalam and Tabla were among the other events featured on the day.There was also an exhibition of tribal dances from students of districts such as Wayanad, Kasaragod and Idukki. It was not part of the competition, though.
