Holding the termination of a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) conductor from service as illegal, the Delhi High Court has ordered a lump sum compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to him.The Labour court had ordered payment of back wages to the conductor, Jagdish Prashad, from the date of termination of his service till his retirement along with continuity of service and consequential benefits.The public sector transport company had terminated the conductor in 2006 on the allegations that he had issued two tickets of lesser denomination after having accepted full fare from the passengers in 1994.According to the conductor, the Corporation charge-sheeted him in 1994, issued a show cause notice in March 2006 and terminated him from service in December 2006.In his claim petition in the Labour court seeking his reinstatement with full back wages along with consequential benefits, the conductor had argued that that the findings of the inquiry officer were perverse and not based on evidence.Countering it, counsel for the Corporation argued that the inquiry was conducted according to the principles of natural justice and full opportunity was given to him to defend his case.However, the Labour court passed an order in favour the conductor.Later, the Corporation challenged the lower court’s order in the High Court.The High Court upheld the Labour court order so far as the termination of the conductor is concerned but it modified the relief granted to him.“So far as the finding regarding holding the termination to be illegal, the same does not warrant any interference,” Justice Sunita Gupta said in her order.Modifying the lower court order, Justice Gupta said: “…awarding him full wages with all consequential benefits when he had not worked with DTC initially from 1994 to 2003 and thereafter from 2006 till the date of his superannuation would tantamount to unjust enrichment without working for almost 18 years.”“…award is modified by granting a lump-sum compensation of Rs.5,00,000 to the workman. The same be paid to him within a period of eight weeks,” Justice Gupta said in her order.Delhi Transport Corporation had terminated the conductor from service in 2006
