The objective is to increase the conversion rate of these proposals into actual investments as against the average rate of 10 per cent. It was 6.5 per cent in the combined State.“We have to fine-tune our policies, have effective tracking system to see how these proposals are panning out and have the nodal officers to follow up with the investors and facilitate speedy execution of projects by completing the formalities without any delay,” highly placed sources said. The State, despite battling its financial crunch post bifurcation, has done well for itself in attracting investments with the Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu wasting no time in visiting various countries to promote various sectors with high potential growth. “ We have investments worth Rs.3 lakh crore on hand now due to the efforts made in the last 18 months. Of this, Rs.30,000 crore is to be invested in infrastructure sector and Rs.50,000 crore in industry. Our target is to launch projects and development schemes worth Rs.1.5 lakh crore before March 31,” sources said.Trade chamber roped inTo make it happen, the government has roped in AP Chamber of Commerce with about 1,000 members besides consultants engaged for various sectors to pursue with the investors.
