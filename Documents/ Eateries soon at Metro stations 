Chennai Metro Rail plans to establish eateries at stations between Koyambedu and Alandur.According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), eateries will first be started at Koyambedu and Alandur stations.Eventually, other stations will have them, depending on the traffic and also the response. Currently, Koyambedu and Alandur stations see maximum passenger traffic in Chennai Metro Rail with an average of about 3,000 and 5,000 commuters using the stations every day.“We are already making arrangements at the Koyambedu station and hopefully it will be launched soon. We want to first see how people are taking to it,” an official said. These eateries would be located at the street-level area of the stations, he added.Eatables are not allowed inside the paid area of the station, which starts after the ticketing area. So, commuters cannot consume food there.“People who want to carry it may do so. But they cannot eat inside the station or on the train. People who violate the rules will first be warned. If they continue to eat at the platforms and on the trains, we will fine them,” an official added. Sources said they had this rule in place to ensure that the stations were not littered.Chennai Metro Rail, being built at a cost of Rs. 14,600 crore, extends to 45 km. In the first phase, the service between Koyambedu and Alandur was launched only six months ago.
