The Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry has expressed dismay at the proposal by the operator of the International Container Transshipment Terminal here to hike tariffs by nearly seven per cent for all services at the Vallarpadam terminal.A statement issued by the Chamber said while Cochin Port Trust revises the scale of rates every five years, the terminal operator’s move was “untimely”. The Chamber “fails to see the logic behind this untimely move to hike the terminal handling charges”, said the statement from Chamber president C.S. Kartha here.These proposals, if approved by the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, “will only serve in imposing a greater financial burden on the already beleaguered exim community, forcing them to divert their cargo”, the Chamber president was cited as saying.Export-import trade through the ICTT here has been stagnant for a while though the port authority and other stakeholders have been trying to turn things around. The port authority here has offered to reduce berth charges in proportion to the volume handled by DP World at Vallarpadam.However, the current move will reverse the good work done till date.If the rates are revised, it would only help deplete the cargo throughput at the container terminal, the statement added.The Chamber also claimed that Kochi was the costliest port in the region and one of the most expensive in the world in terms of vessel handling charges.
