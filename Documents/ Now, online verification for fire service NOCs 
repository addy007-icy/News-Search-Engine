Going a notch further in making its services citizen-friendly, the Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services Department is putting in place an online verification for obtaining provisional ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC).Anyone interested in obtaining the document should key in the necessary details on its website (http://fire.telangana.gov.in), do the check list, pay the prescribed fees and get the certificate. More significantly, the module is being designed in such a manner that the software will reject applications if the buildings concerned do not require any sort of fire clearance.“We have realised over the last few years’ fire safety NOCs are being issued for buildings which do not come under Fire Service Act. Under the guise of fire safety, many building owners are being subjected to unnecessary hassles even where it is not required,” explains Director General, TS Fire Services, Rajiv Ratan.The Fire Act of 1999, Schedule 13 is pretty clear that NOCs have to be taken for any “constriction which is of more than 15 metres height for commercial and business purposes, 18 metres and above height (above five floors) for residential purposes plus also for buildings of public congregation like schools, cinema halls, function halls, religious places which are more than 500 sq. metres in plot area of six metres and above height”.Applications for the NOCs have to be made to the DG or any member of the service duly authorised by him before submission of building plans to the local authority concerned. “We will strictly go by this rule. We cannot on our own act in a vigilante manner demanding all kinds of buildings take up fire fighting measures when it is not mandated by the law,” he points out.For example, the department has realised that it has little more than 1,500 buildings within the capital coming under its purview to check for fire fighting prowess, but much to its surprise NOCs have been issued to a large number of buildings not coming under the prescribed rules.To rectify matters and provide greater clarity, a circular has been issued to all district fire officers delegated to issue provisional and occupancy NOCs to various kinds of non-high rise buildings not to issue them hereafter and any orders issued in contrast to schedule 13 of Fire Act are cancelled.Anyone acting in violation of this will be attracting disciplinary action, it stated.
