The inordinate delay in launching Phase-I of the Muziris Heritage Project has thrown into disarray Kerala Tourism’s plans to market the locale, said Tourism officials.We have not been able to begin full-fledged marketing of the locale, launch the official website, logo and promotional videos, release a coffee table book or introduce online payments. The Phase-II works would gain pace only if Phase-I comprising seven museums and four sites — two forts and two markets — are formally opened to visitors, they said.The sprawling Paliam museum and the Paravur synagogue are two main heritage attractions that have been conserved.Till December, Tourism officials were hopeful that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would inaugurate Phase-I during his Kerala visit. However, now that Mr. Modi is not expected to inaugurate the project, they are likely to invite President Pranab Mukherjee. “Every effort is being made to launch the project in February and we hope to get confirmation from the President,” Tourism officials said.While detractors of the project allege that many works still remain incomplete, tourism mandarins say only the panel works on the Islamic history museum are pending. The Phase-I work is estimated to cost Rs. 108.5 crore, of which the Centre has pooled in Rs. 42 crore and the State, Rs. 52 crore. The PWD spent Rs. 10 crore on readying the roads and allied infrastructure, while the Irrigation Department was given Rs 4.50 crore for building boat jetties.A total of 26 museums are expected to be conserved as part of the Muziris project. This includes a maritime museum spread over 50 acres. The State government is expected to allot Rs. 25 crore each year for the initiative, Tourism sources said.
