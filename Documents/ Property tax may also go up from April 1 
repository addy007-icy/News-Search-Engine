Residents of south Delhi may have to shell out more as property tax from April 1 as the local municipality is considering a hike in rates.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Standing Committee has cleared the way for a hike by passing the proposal during a special session to present the budget for 2016-2017.On January 20, the House will deliberate on the hike in property tax rates as well as the imposition of new ‘professional tax’, which was also cleared by the Standing Committee.SDMC Commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel had proposed a two per cent and one per cent hike for A and B category colonies, and for C, D and E categories respectively during his budget speech on December 9, 2015.He had also proposed reducing the rebate for timely property tax payments from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.“We reject all the proposed reductions to the rebates and incentives we give. However, we are placing the proposal for the hike in property tax rates before the House. After a debate, the House will decide,” said Mr. Sharma, refusing to comment on whether the ruling-BJP would actually implement the increase.If passed, the rates for A and B colonies would go up from 12 per cent to 14 per cent and those in C,D and E category colonies will have to pay 12 per cent, up from 11 per cent. There will be no change in rates for F, G and H categories.The estimated income for the next financial year, meanwhile, was revised from Rs.3,857.56 crore (proposed by Commissioner) to Rs.4,079.56 crore.Mr. Sharma said the Commissioner’s budget had underestimated revenue from advertisement tax, street vending licence fees, mobile towers, fines on illegal slaughtering, community centres and regularisation of farmhouses.
