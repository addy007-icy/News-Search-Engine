The Fisheries Department has asked fishermen to remove Chinese nets set up along the route of National Waterways in the Kayamkulam backwaters. The government had allocated compensation for removing about 90 per cent of the nets as per an understanding reached with the fishermen.Fixing the nets in waterways will be a violation of the Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, 2010 and the Inland Waterway Act. Cases will be registered against those who do not remove the nets that could cause hindrance to the waterways, according to the Fisheries Deputy Director, Alappuzha.
