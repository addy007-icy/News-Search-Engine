The shifting of inspection activities of commercial vehicles from the premises of the Regional Transport Office near A.B. Shetty Circle here to a temporary premises near Kuloor on January 1 has had a telling effect on vehicular movement in the central parts of the city.The frequent traffic jams on Maidan Road, where the RTO is located, during working days, has become a thing of the past as heavy vehicles, including buses, trucks, multi-axle vehicles, are no longer subjected to inspection on the RTO premises.The inspection activities, including those of issuing fitness certificate and registration of commercial vehicles, are now being taken up at an open ground at Bangra Kuloor. The district administration has temporarily allowed the Transport Department to utilise about two acres of land there.While the shifting has brought a breather, going through the inspection process has become an arduous process both for the department personnel and vehicle owners, as the land has no shelter at all.The inspection activities have to be carried out on the land which is completely open to the sky with not even a tree for shade, rued a vehicle owner when The Hindu visited the location on Thursday. Two stone benches have been got up to help inspectors of motor vehicles for writing down reports. The visitors are also affected by dust brought from heaps of earth stocked nearby whenever there is a gusty wind, complained a vehicle owner.However, one of the inspectors said that providing the temporary place itself was a big favour done by the administration. Demanding other basic facilities might not be proper as the department anyhow is planning to move to a permanent facility near Mudipu, he said.In-charge Senior Regional Transport Officer and Deputy Commissioner for Transport G.S. Hegde said that the department is aware of these problems. They would be addressed within the possible limitations, he added.He also said that water is sprinkled often in the area to prevent dust from blowing into peopleâ€™s faces.
