A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday asked the Sabarimala Special Commissioner to look into the allegations levelled by the Forest Department against the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) regarding waste management at the hill shrineIn a report filed before the court, the department alleged that the TDB was turning a deaf ear to the court directive on waste management at Sabarimala. The report said the recent death of a deer at Sabarimala was due to consumption of plastic waste. The Bench observed that it did not makes sense to clear the banks of the Pampa, trekking path and Sannidhanam of plastic and then throw such materials into the forest area.
