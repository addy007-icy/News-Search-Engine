After finding some pathways blocked, New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi has asked the local civic body to act against encroachments in Lutyensâ€™ Delhi. Ms. Lekhi told the New Delhi Municipal Council officials that dustbins and street vendors were obstructing the pathways and making it especially difficult for visually-impaired people to walk around Connaught Place.

These encroachments, she said, should be removed and relocated keeping in view possible security implications and cleanliness in the area.Ms. Lekhi said the quantum of fine be increased and challans be handed out on the spot by dedicated magistrates. Adding that necessary changes in the law would be made, the MP said construction and demolition waste (C&D) generated by ongoing building activity should be removed quickly.
