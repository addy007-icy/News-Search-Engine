Balasaheb Thackeray may have given his son Uddhav the ‘remote control’ of power, but the latter has handed it over to me, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said here on Saturday.“Now that (Shiv Sena president) Uddhav Thackeray has handed over the remote control (of power) to me, other (Sena) ministers should also understand this,” Mr Fadnavis said, in an apparent reference to some Shiv Sena ministers criticising his style of functioning.Mr Fadnavis was speaking at an event organised on the occasion of Bal Thackeray’s birth anniversary, where the state transport corporation (MSRTC) unveiled the ‘Shivshahi’ luxury bus service. This alliance (BJP-Sena) will govern the State for the full five-year term, irrespective of what some may say or think, Mr Fadnavis said. Uddhav lauded State transport minister Diwakar Raote, a Sena leader, for introducing the ‘Shivshahi’ bus service.Meanwhile, addressing party activists at a function to commemorate the anniversary of Marmik magazine in the evening, the Sena chief hit out at the BJP for eyeing power in the 2017 BMC elections. “Some people are dreaming about hoisting their flag atop the BMC. They dreamed of doing it from the Delhi assembly and the Bihar assembly, but what happened? Not only will the Shiv Sena flag fly atop the BMC, it will do so from the Vidhan Sabha,” he said.(With PTI inputs)
