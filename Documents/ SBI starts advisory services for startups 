Its customers would have access to a relationship manager and trained investment experts who would guide them on best investment options across categories.“Introducing wealth management has been one of the bank’s top strategic priorities as we have a number of HNI customers and potentially many more whose banking needs are more sophisticated and who require a highly specialised service delivery mechanism,” she said.For the HNIs service, SBI has tied up with technology partners to include lifestyle benefits such as a special wellness benefit card and top-tier credit and debit cards, tax and legacy planning services and cash pick-up and delivery.
