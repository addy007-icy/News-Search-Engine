Protests over the death of Rohith Vemula continued for yet another day in the Capital, with students refusing to call off their agitation despite Hyderabad University revoking suspension of the four Dalit students.“Revoking suspension cannot bring back Rohith's life. Why was this not done earlier when the issue was raised? We will continue with the agitation till our demands are met which include action against the Vice-Chancellor and resignation of the two Union Ministers,” said Shehla Rashid Shora, vice-president JNU Students Union, who was in Hyderabad along with a two-member delegation.DU professor, Abha Dev Habib, said: “This hooliganism on campuses has to stop. The government or the university can't do damage control just by revoking the suspension. We demand that the Vice-Chancellor be penalised for this and his accountability should be defined”.“Rohith was institutionally murdered and the HRD ministry played a key role in creating such situation. There has to be a judicial inquiry into the casteist attack on Dalit students by Hyderabad University and the Vice Chancellor needs to be expelled,” the students said.The Congress-affiliated National Students Union of India (NSUI), CPI-M's Student Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Student Foundation (DSF), independent groups Krantikari Yuva Sangathan and Bhagat Singh Chhatra Ekta Manch, also said the protests will continue.Earlier in the day, several protests were held and 20 demonstrators were detained.The students were protesting in front of the HRD Ministry and when the agitation intensified 20 of them were detained, a senior police official said.Protests were held at Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia also where effigies of HRD Minister Smriti Irani were burnt amid shouting of slogans.Revoking suspension cannot bring back Rohith's lifeShehla Rashid Shoravice-president, JNU Students’ Union
