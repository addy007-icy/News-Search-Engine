The ongoing protest by Opposition Congress against the large scale irregularities in issuance of ration cards under the National Food Security Act continued with a group of Mahila Congress activists showing black flags to School & Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra in Sambalpur on Wednesday.Activists of the students’ wing of Congress had thrown eggs at Health & Family Welfare Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak’s car while he was returning to Deogarh from Sambalpur on Tuesday. Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Das Burma was at the receiving end on Monday. Student Congress activists had hurled eggs at his car in Ganjam district while he was on his way to attend the golden jubilee celebrations of Berhampur University.Congress activists had also hurled eggs at the vehicle of Mr. Das Burma in Puri on January 3 while he was camping at special circuit house there. While five persons were arrested in connection with the incident in Puri, three youths were arrested in connection hurling of eggs at Mr. Das Burma’s car in Ganjam.Meanwhile, spokesman of ruling BJD Pratap Keshari Deb blamed the Congress for hurling eggs at the Ministers’ vehicles.He threatened that the BJD activists would resort to such tactics when the Congress leaders go on tour.Justifying the protest by the Congress activists in the rural areas, senior party leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra said their party would not hesitate to hit back if the BJD resorts to such form of protest.The Congress has been taking up the ration card scam issue across the State since distribution of the digitised ration cards under the NFSA was started by the State government several weeks ago. The party has been alleging that a large number of deserving families were denied the new ration cards while those owing allegiance to the ruling BJD had managed to procure these cards despite not been deserving as per the rules.The ration card scam was established with the resignation of Mayor of Cuttack after it was found that she had been issued such a card.A number of such cases involving the BJD are being reported from various parts of the State during the past few days.In another development, senior BJP leader Bijoy Mohapatra at a press conference announced that his party would organise protests against the State government since many poor families had been denied the ration cards at the village level.
