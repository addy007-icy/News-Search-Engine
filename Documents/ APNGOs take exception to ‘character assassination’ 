The APNGOs’ Association on Wednesday found fault with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) showing market values of properties seized from employees accused of corruption.Instead, the ACB should declare the registered values as a majority of the employees might have bought the properties a few decades ago, the association said.Association’s State associate president Chowdary Purushottam Naidu and district wing president Hanumanthu Sairam said that the issue would be discussed on priority during the APNGOs’ general body meeting scheduled to be conducted in Srikakulam on February 13 and 14.Mr. Purushottam Naidu said: “An employee might have bought a piece of land for Rs.50,000 about 20 years ago and its present market value may be Rs.50 lakh. It does not mean that he amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. We are not supporting employees involved in corrupt practices. We, however, take exception to character assassination.”“The ACB should not reveal details to the media without proper verification,” he said.Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and association’s State president P. Ashok Babu would inaugurate the convention, he said. Employees’ grievances would be discussed at length, he added.The association would insist on regularisation of services of 1.4 lakh outsourcing and contract employees in the State. It would also ask the government to release two DAs.Association’s district secretary R.V.N. Sarma said that employees in Srikakulam were being denied the 20 per cent HRA as old population records were being considered for tabulation of the same. He said that the NGOs would also urge the Union Government to revise the Income-Tax slabs.The association is likely to elect its new president at the convention.Registered and not present market value of properties seized should be revealed
