: Marking an end to the crisis in the Malayalam film industry, the stand-off between the Kerala Film Producers Association and the Film Employees Federation of Kerala (FEFKA) was finally sorted out on Monday. The two organisations signed a new wage agreement and the production of films is slated to resume from Tuesday. As per the agreement, the producersâ€™ association will increase the daily wages of day technicians, including lightboys, camera assistants and costume assistants by 20 per cent for the next one-and-a-half years. The FEFKA has agreed to return the amount they received from the producers of films that were released during Christmas.
