A Rs. 3.4-crore proposal for taking up development activity at the Nagoba temple in Keslapur village of Indervelli mandal is awaiting green signal from the State government, said Adilabad MP G. Nagesh.The development activity will be related to the famous Adivasi fair, the Nagoba jatara, which will commence on February 7.At a preparatory meeting for the jatara, Mr. Nagesh said the State government was prepared to provide all the required help to make the annual programme a grand success. The jatara is a religious event of Mesram clan of Gonds, who make a pilgrimage to their clan deity Nagoba or serpent god during the period.The Project Officer of Utnoor Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), R.V. Karnan, said a couple of bore-wells would be sunk under the banyan tree where the Gond families coming from distant places stay before reaching the temple.He said the land under the existing tree would be levelled for the convenience of the Adivasis.Mr. Karnan also promised to look into the allegation of lethargy made against officials of the ITDA. Khanapur MLA A. Rekha Naik had accused the officials of delaying development works in her constituency.Collector M. Jagan Mohan appealed to the officials of various departments to make the jatara a smooth affair by their contribution.He said the event would be held with pomp and gaiety as usual.
