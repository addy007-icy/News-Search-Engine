The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has undertaken survey of individual sanitary latrines (ISL) and those in government schools in Sirpur (U) tribal mandal in Adilabad district which are being funded by the Union government as part of Swacch Bharat mission.The initiative began on Friday with 65 NSS volunteers from Vivek Vardhini Degree College in Mancherial conducting the survey under the guidance of BJP’s State executive committee member Gone Shyamsunder Rao and Bharatiya Kisan Morcha district president Dipak Singh Shekhawat.“We have selected this mandal, as the progress here ranks the last in the country in terms of construction of latrines in houses,” Mr. Rao disclosed to The Hindu .“The Sirpur (U) tribal mandal has 7,000 household and only a lowly three per cent of those have latrines,” he pointed out.The students went around with questionnaires to assess the status of construction of latrines in houses and six schools initially in the mandal headquarter village.They found that 90 per cent of houses had no latrines, while the ones constructed in the schools were not being used owing to no water connection.“Another problem which came to our notice relates to the heavy cost of construction in this remote mandal. Construction material like and bricks need to be brought in from Kagaznagar, about 75 km from here which poses difficulty for the Advasi beneficiaries,” the BJP leader added.The party would submit a report on its findings to the State government aiming at resolution of the problems. The survey will cover all the villages in the mandal.
