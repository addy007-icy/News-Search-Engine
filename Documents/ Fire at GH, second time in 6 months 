A fire broke out at the surgical intensive care unit of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in the early hours on Monday, forcing the staff to shift 16 patients to other wards.The fire, believed to have been caused by an electrical short circuit, broke out in cubicle 2 of the ward 213. The patient in that cubicle, N. Pandurajan, died a little later, but hospital authorities said the death was caused by complications arising from his health condition. Two other patients of the ward, 60-year-old Mannammal and 52-year-old Raja, died later.This is the second fire to break out in the ward in less than six months. Last August, a fire broke out, but in a different part of the ward, leading to evacuation of eight patients. No one was injured, and the fire was then thought to have originated in a ventilator unit’s switchboard.The RMO, Dr. Elango, said Monday's fire which occurred around 3.15 a.m. at the unit that had both pre-operative and post-operative patients — 11 male and five females, including a 13-year-old girl. Three of them were on ventilators. There was a short circuit in one of the wires leading to the cubicle. There were some sparks and smoke. The staff immediately turned off the mains and promptly evacuated all 16 patients to other wards,” he said.
