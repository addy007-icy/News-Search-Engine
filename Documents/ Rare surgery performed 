Chest specialists at Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda, on Friday said that they successfully performed a procedure known as lung lavage (popularly known as lung washing) on a 24-year-old girl, who was struggling with a rare lung disorder. Lung lavage is a treatment for a rare disorder known as Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP). According to doctors, for persons with PAP, a protein called surfactant builds up in the lungs over a period of time. Due to accumulation of surfactant, patients are unable to breath on their own and quite often need oxygen to survive. Post the procedure, the girl is now able to breathe, walk and even climb stairs properly, doctors said.
