One hot afternoon,It’s so hot, what a pity.For vendors around Chennai cityI’m here in my bed,Already well fed,Waiting for the power to come.Looking at the fan which is slowing down,Looking at myself, sweat flowing down.I look up at a bird flying,In the cold and chilly air.That’s not fair!!I say with a frown,It’s like a king without a crownFor how can I fly?I have to let it go,It’s just a stupid thought,Not to be cared aboutBut to be borne.To avoid the long power cut,I write this song!Oh! the power has comeBye, tata for nowBHAVNA.
