Ivan Popov has emerged as the man to beat in the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament.The second-seeded Russian scored his seventh victory in as many rounds following a well-calculated queen-sacrifice against Ukraine’s Vitaly Sivuk. With three rounds to go, Popov holds a 1.5-point lead over the nearest challengers.Young talent Sayantan Das proved equal to top-seeded Russian GM Boris Grachev to join Sivuk and nine others at 5.5 points. Encouragingly, Pradeep Kumar continued his fine run against GMs and virtually sealed an International Master norm after a 54-move draw with Sriram Jha.Though four of the top five boards ended as draws, Popov was relentless in his pursuit of victory on the top board.His 32-move destruction of overnight second-placed Sivuk was rather sudden. Once he saw a five-move combination to trade his queen and bishop for two rooks, a bishop and a knight to leave Sivuk in a hopeless position. Sayantan was locked in a closed position in Sicilian Defence with Grachev. Though the Russian did create some pressure with well-planted pawns, the two chose to sign peace instead of engaging in long battle.Meanwhile, the ‘C’ Category tournament, for those rated 1599 and below, opened with a record-making field. In all, 1012 players started the 10-round competition, making it the largest congregation of players in an event that has an official entry fee of Rs. 3,500 in the country.The results (Indians unless stated):Seventh round: Ivan Popov (Rus, 7) bt Vitaly Sivuk (Ukr, 5.5); Sayantan Das (5.5) drew with Boris Grachev (Rus, 5.5); S.
