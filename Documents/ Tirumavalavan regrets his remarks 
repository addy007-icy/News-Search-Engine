Two days after a scathing attack on the “corrupt” Dravidian parties for trying to position themselves as alternative to each other, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Tirumavalavan on Thursday expressed regret over his remark comparing the rival political leaders with “poisonous snakes”.“I had made the remarks during my extempore speech (at the People’s Welfare Front conference held here on Tuesday). But, with the cadre of DMK taking exception to my remarks on Facebook, I express my regrets for that,” he told reporters here.The Dalit leader said that he only wanted to drive home the point among the cadres that both the parties were equally corrupt and they could not be alternative to each other. But, since the remarks were seen as personal attacks on DMK president M. Karunanidhi and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Jayalalithaa, “I express my regrets,” he said. He claimed that his criticism had always been ideology-based and he never made any personal attack on any leader.Mr. Tirumavalavan also clarified that his explanation should not be seen as a sign of his party drifting away towards the DMK alliance. He expressed confidence that Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam and Tamil Maanila Congress would join the PWF to bring about a political change in the State.
