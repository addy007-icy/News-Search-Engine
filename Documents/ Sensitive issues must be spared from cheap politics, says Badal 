Slamming the opposition parties for “politicizing” the issue of Pathankot terror attack, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Friday said that sensitive issues involving national security must be spared from cheap politics.On the sidelines of the State government’s Sangat Darshan programme in Rajasansi Sssembly segment here, the Chief Minister said that it was unfortunate that the political leadership was making “baseless statements” on the terror attack.“Our brave soldiers have valiantly protected honour of the country but some political outfits were washing dirty linen on it for sake of vested interests, which is shameful,” Mr. Badal said.He said there were a number of issues for political leaders to debate but they must at least spare such issues where nation’s security was concerned.The Opposition, including the Congress and AAP have criticised the SAD-BJP government’s handling of last week’s terror attack on the IAF base in Pathankot.While state Congress chief Amarinder Singh described the state government’s response during the last two attacks in Dina Nagar and Pathankot as “casual and disappointing”, AAP noted that the “nexus” of Akali leaders, drug peddlers and militants resulted in the militant attack at Pathankot.Reiterating the state government’s firm commitment to help the bereaved families of security personnel killed in the Pathankot attack, Mr. Badal said that every effort would be made to bail out the families from the crisis.He said that the state government had already decided to provide a financial assistance of Rs. 25 lakh to next of kin of the martyrs along with a government job as a humble tribute to the brave soldiers.The Chief Minister said that he had asked the Centre to beef up the security at the borders to prevent cross-border terrorism.He said that it was the need of the hour to ensure that incidents like Dinanagar and Pathankot do not happen again.Mr. Badal added that his government was fully committed for preserving peace and amity in the State and no one would be allowed to disturb it. -
