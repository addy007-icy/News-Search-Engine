These Annamacharya Project artistes have lent their voice to many mellifluous numbers and donned several mythological characters to propagate the Hindu Dharma on behalf of the TTD. But, for the first time, they played an altogether new role.On the eighth day of their ongoing strike against the TTD management here on Tuesday for neglecting their long-pending demands, eight women artistes donned the role of ‘Ashta Lakshmi’, the eight variants of the goddess of wealth, to explain their poverty. Clad in colourful saris and wearing a crown on their heads, the artistes also bore a specific feature representing their role. Their demands include payment of better wages, ID cards, laddus, free treatment in SVIMS, and insurance on a par with employees on the TTD rolls.
