I challenge them to start construction and I will give them Rs 10 lakhs and a gold crown,” SP MLC Bukkal Nawab told PTI.SP spokesman and Cabinet minister Shivpal Yadav said: “BJP is playing with the sentiments of people in the name of construction of Ram temple. They are not telling the site where they will build the temple. Our government will follow the court order in this regard.”“ Na ek eint uthegi na hi lagegi (neither a single brick will be lifted nor it be installed),” he told reporters.He also alleged that the BJP was raising the issue of cow slaughter but its own men were involved in slaughtering.MLC Bukkal Nawab said: “Though the matter is pending before SC, BJP leaders are busy in giving dates for start of construction for the temple. BJP itself did not want construction of the temple there (in Ayodhya) and was only playing politics on the issue.”However, the party downplayed Mr. Nawab’s statement.When asked about it, Shivpal Yadav said: “It’s good if Bukkal gets the temple constructed.
