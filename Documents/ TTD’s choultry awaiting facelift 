The more than five-decade-old choultry of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, consisting of 32 rooms, in the famous pilgrim centre of Bhadrachalam is awaiting the much-needed facelift to ensure improved amenities for pilgrims.According to sources, the foundation stone for the TTDâ€™s choultry was laid by the then Finance Minister Kasu Brahmananda Reddy in Bhadrachalam in 1960. The choultry was inaugurated in 1964.Sources said that some of the rooms of the choultry are in urgent need of renovation and repairs to plug roof leaks. The old electricity wiring system in the choultry has virtually become obsolete, sources added.The TTD choultry continues to remain the favourite choice of many pilgrims due to its central location, low room tariff of Rs. 100 per day, and the limited accommodation facilities in the temple townThe hopes of denizens of the temple town for a facelift to the TTD choultry have revived ever since TDP MLA from Sattupalli Sandra Venkata Veeraiah of the district was inducted into the TTD Trust Board in the neighbouring State by the Andhra Pradesh government last year.
