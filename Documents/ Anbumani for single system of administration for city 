Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) MP Anbumani Ramadoss, on Saturday, made a strong case for a single system of administration for Chennai city, arguing that the three-tier administrative system had created wheels within wheels.“As a district it is administered by Collector; as a Corporation, Mayor presides over the administration and as a metropolitan area, it comes under the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). But there is hardly any coordination among them,” he said after releasing the document— TheChennai We Want-Towards a new urban agenda for Chennai Metropolitan Area.Alleging that destruction of waterbodies and canals that worked as a natural drainage system for Chennai had caused the flood during the recent monsoon, he said Pallikaranai, a marshland rich in flora and fauna, had been converted into a dumping yard.“This clearly shows the lack of vision of our rulers and officials. Instead of adopting a sustainable development model, we have destroyed all natural resources in the name of achieving growth,” he said.Dr. Ramadoss also said that desalination plants were suitable only for deserts, and Chennai, with its waterbodies, could easily meet the water requirements of its people.“If we can bring water from Veeranam lake, almost 300 miles away from Chennai, why not from lakes in the neighbouring districts? We need two big lakes and eight small lakes,” he said.Former IAS officer M.G. Devasahayam, who received the first copy of the document, said world over, 80 per cent of stormwater was drained through natural drainage systems. Man-made construction constituted only 20 per cent. He alleged conversion of Special Economic Zones into real estate assets for Foreign Direct Investment was the root cause of all problems.
