Farmers of the Karimnagar district, who are already reeling under drought conditions since last two years, are worried lot with the wild animals’ menace which are destroying the irrigated dry (ID) crops sown in some pockets of the district.Due to drought and non-availability of water sources with the drying up of all the irrigation sources, farmers have gone in for the ID crops with the available water sources in the open and bore wells. But, the wild animals’ such as wild bears, boars, simians and peacocks are playing havoc with the lives of the farmers.Following the prevailing drought conditions, the wild animals have started intruding into human habitations in search of food and water. The food-starved wild animals entering into fields were destroying the ID crops such as maize, jowar, ground nut, green gram, Bengal gram and vegetables, etc.The farmers were taking all measures to protect the crops by tying sarees, plastic sheets, used water bottles etc to scare the wild animals and also sprinkling of pesticides around the fields, but in vain. Farmers have also erected ‘manch’ and guarding their fields round-the-clock and making sounds by using drum and utensils to scare the wild animals.Anjanna from Manakondur mandal, who cultivated maize in two acres of land, said that the monkeys and wild bears were destroying his crop in spite of taking all preventive measure to scare the animals. Already, we are worried lot with non-availability of water and protection of the crops. The wild animal menace had become a nightmarish experience for us, he added.A farmer Venkat Reddy from Mujampalli village of Manakondur mandal literally wailed when asked about his groundnut crop.He had taken two acres of land on lease and cultivated groundnut. But, a horde of monkeys attacked his fields and destroyed the crop in search of food. We are informing the authorities to protect the crops from wild animals, but in vain, he complained.The man-animal conflict, which started with the advent of granite quarry operations, had aggravated during this drought conditions, said a forest range officer.“We had constructed the percolation tanks and water storage points in the forests for the benefit of wild animals. But, there were no inflows due to drought and the forests have also withered forcing the animals to stray into human habitations in search of food and water”, he stated.He said that they were planning to prepare an action plan to ensure that the water was made available to the wild animals in the jungles during the summer season.
