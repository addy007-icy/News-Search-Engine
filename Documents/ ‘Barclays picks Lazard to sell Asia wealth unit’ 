Credit Suisse is among a handful of banks which have expressed an interest in making a bid, the sources said, adding talks were at an early stage.If successful, the deal would help the Swiss bank win market share in a highly-competitive wealth management market in Asia, led by global players such as UBS and Citigroup.Credit Suisse is evaluating the synergies it could extract from Barclays' portfolio of high net-worth individuals in Asia, one of the sources said, cautioning a deal was not certain.Barclays, Lazard and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Reuters reported Dec. 18 that DBS Group Holdings and Julius Baer were likely to enter the race for the unit which could be valued at about $600 million.
