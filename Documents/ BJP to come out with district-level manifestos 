With its unimpressive performance in the recent elections to the Legislative Council, the Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to alter its strategy for the coming elections to zilla and taluk panchayats by focussing on “micro-management”, which includes bringing out district-level manifestos. This decision was taken at a series of meetings held by party leaders, office-bearers and members of the highest decision-making body of the core committee in Bengaluru on Monday.Briefing reporters, BJP State general secretary C.T. Ravi said the party would bring out pre-poll manifestos for each of the districts, besides a State-level manifesto. “The ZP, TP elections are the crucial ones, which will not only reflect the pulse of the people, but also indicate the nature of things to come in the next Assembly polls,” he said. He blamed the alleged misuse of government machinery and extravagant spending by the Congress for the BJP’s failure in the Council polls. When he was reminded that the BJP’s rebel candidate had defeated the party’s official candidate, he said the lack of co-ordination and micro-management efforts too had played a role in the party’s debacle. The BJP has decided to form nine teams of senior leaders to tour the State from January 10 to 14, and to hold consultations with local leaders on selection of candidates.Party decides to focus on ‘micro-management’ in crucial rural local bodies polls
