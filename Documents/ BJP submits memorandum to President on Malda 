Accusing the Mamata government in West Bengal of “vote bank politics” and minority appeasement, the BJP on Saturday submitted a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee on the recent Malda violence and requested him to seek a report from the Governor on the issue. The memorandum saw the violence as a threat to “national security.”The delegation also presented another memorandum to the President on the State government’s “inaction” in arresting the accused in the hit-and-run case involving the son of a Trinamool Congress leader who allegedly overran and killed an Air Force jawan in Kolkata.
