This refers to the editorial “Time for a national security doctrine” (Jan. 5). Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not allow the Delhi-Lahore bus service, Sada-e-Sarhad, a symbol of the efforts of the then NDA government to promote peaceful and friendly relations with Pakistan on the basis of reciprocity, to be terminated even when then Pakistan Army chief Pervez Musharraf launched an attack in Kargil. The idea was not to let India-Pakistan bilateral relations succumb to hostile passions and ensure that the bus remained a symbol of the desire of the people of the two countries to maintain people-to-people contacts.The cowardly attack on the Pathankot airbase is yet another attempt by the extremist forces to perpetrate terror on Indian territory. By restarting dialogue with Pakistan, the Modi government has wisely differentiated between the Pakistan government and non-state actors. It is in India’s interest to continue with its policy of diplomatic protest than adopt a muscular approach towards its neighbour. It is time the government came up with a national security doctrine that not only prevents Pakistan from promoting faith-based militancy against India but also defines India’s role in the world and its commitment to protecting the life, liberty and interests of its people.Shreyans Jain,New Delhi
