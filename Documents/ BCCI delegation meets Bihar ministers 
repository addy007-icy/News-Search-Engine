A two-member Board of Control for Cricket in India delegation met high-profile ministers and officials of Bihar in Patna on Saturday to discuss the Bihar Cricket Association’s request for improving the cricket infrastructure in the State.Prof Ratnakar Shetty and KVP Rao, general manager and manager of BCCI’s game development wing, respectively, held meetings with Shiv Chandra Ram, Bihar’s minister of sport, youth and cultural activity and Abdul Bari Siddiqui, the elected president of BCA who is also the State finance minister, along with top bureaucrats of the State.The Hindu understands the need for the meeting arose after the BCA sent a proposal for financial aid for renovating the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium in Patna.The Bihar cricket administration has been muddled in controversies ever since the BCCI replaced Bihar with Jharkhand as a full member in 2004, the BCCI top brass decided it was best to inspect the facilities and discuss the road ahead with all parties concerned.Once Shetty and Rao submit their report, the BCCI will decide on whether to disburse funds to the committee or not.Meanwhile, Aditya Verma, secretary of the unrecognised Cricket Association of Bihar and petitioner in the 2013 IPL corruption scandal that led to the Supreme Court-appointed Justice RM Lodha Committee proposing BCCI’s systemic overhaul, has condemned the action.“It seems like this is an attempt to subvert the recommendations of the Lodha Committee and avert any direction by the Supreme Court. There is no need for such haste in the matter,” Verma said.
