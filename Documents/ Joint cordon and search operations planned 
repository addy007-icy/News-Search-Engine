Realising that criminals are preferring slums and working class-dominated areas located on the outskirts of the twin commissionerates of Hyderabad and Cyberabad, the police will be organising joint cordon and search operations soon.The decision was taken during a recent cordon and search operations conducted in a few areas in and around the city, when police could not take up the exercise in certain pockets of the same colony due to jurisdiction issues.“There had been occasions when locals informed about anti-social activities being carried out in an adjoining slum. But due to jurisdiction issues, we could not do take up search operations there. A joint exercise will help seal all entry and exit points and conduct a thorough search operation. It will also help improve coordination between local police stations,” a senior police official revealed.In certain instances, the police found that organisers of brothels and gambling dens were hiring houses in bordering areas and carrying out their activities. “If Hyderabad police cracks down, then they take shelter in houses that fall in Cyberabad and vice versa,” another police official explained.The police of border police stations regularly organise meetings and consult their counterparts on various issues regarding crime control, law and order issues and traffic management.
