Pollution levels in the Capital will decrease by almost 50 per cent if the odd-even plan is implemented successfully, according to a report released by the Aryabhatta College on Thursday.The report, however, questioned the policy’s potential effectiveness as it may not have a uniformly distributed impact. A team from the college collected data on vehicular pollution from 14 intersections in eight areas across Delhi to assess the impact of the policy and other public initiatives aimed at improving air quality.Co-ordinated by Professor Harish Dhawan, 18 students and two teachers observed the frequency of vehicles, number of commuters per category of vehicle, and the proportion of different vehicles during peak hours — 9 a.m. to 11a.m.— between December 19 and 23.As expected, private cars and two- wheelers accounted for the majority of traffic, even though their percentage varied from area to area.“This is an important study to supplement current debates about pollution control in Delhi. We have assessed the impact of actual number of vehicles on the road, rather than the typically cited figures of number of registered vehicles,” noted Prof. Dhawan.The report stated that small and medium-sized cars carried less than two persons on an average (about 30 per cent of the car’s capacity), while buses carried commuters close to their maximum capacity.Consequently, the per capita pollution contributed by car users was exponentially greater than those using public transportation.Private cars emitted 46 per cent of carbon monoxide, 13 per cent of hydrocarbons, 10 per cent of nitrogen oxides, 30 per cent of carbon dioxide, and 44 per cent of particulate matter — the most dangerous pollutant.Implementing the odd-even policy will also improve congestion levels sizably.The survey suggested that since 33 per cent of vehicles are private cars, the odd-even policy will halve this to 16.5 per cent during rush hour at major intersections.However, the study assumed that the frequency of buses would increase accordingly. Data suggested that for every 14 cars taken off the roads, one bus would have to be introduced.Further, the study refuted Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s suggestion that carpooling would be a viable alternative during this trial period.“The ease of sharing a vehicle has been overstated. Where people live and work are often different locations,” Prof. Dhawan said. Moreover, cars and three-wheelers were still the biggest pollution contributors per person.Interestingly, the researchers criticised the policy for not acknowledging the traffic patterns across Delhi.“Pollution reduction will not be uniformly distributed because the proportion of types of vehicles is different across the city. A decentralised, area-specific approach could have been more effective,” said Vedansh Nigania, an Economics student in the research team.This observational survey will be followed by more analysis in the next two weeks.The team will collect empirical data on the effectiveness of the policy and suggest its long-term implications if implemented for more than two years.(The writer is an intern with The Hindu)
