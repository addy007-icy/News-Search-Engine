The State government is all set focus on the proposed Machilipatnam Industrial Corridor (MIC) for which nearly 30,000 acres of land is to be spared for various industries and development of deep sea port here.Earlier, it had promised to finalise the mode of gathering the 15,000 acres of private and assigned land for the MIC in the coastal mandals of Machilipatnam and Pedana mandals by early January.In this connection, the government has already completed necessary procedures to set up Machilipatnam Area Development Authority (MADA), with the task of gathering the land proposed for the MIC.The government has reportedly postponed idea of setting up of the MADA before the Partnership Summit 2016, in an attempt to woo the industries to invest in the MIC. Of the many companies lined up to invest in the MIC, an Australia-based company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government to set up 5800 MW of coal-based thermal power project in the MIC in the summit.“Land Pooling System will be adopted to gather the private and assigned land through the MADA, instead of using the land acquisition notification. The MADA will clear all the doubts of the people to be affected in the MIC,” said Excise and B.C. Welfare Minister K. Ravindra.Since the ban on land registrations in the MIC area was in force since August 2015, the MADA was likely to address all the grievances to be raised by farmers before it goes ahead with the land pooling system.“The government’s delay in designing its action plan to gather the land will deepen the issue, disturbing the life of the farmers and other walks of public life in the MIC,” said Left party leaders who have been fighting against the land acquisition.
