: Learning a lesson from the recent ink attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi Police on Monday did not allow fountain pens at a Republic Day event here as a preventive measure.A young woman had on January 17 thrown ink on Kejriwal at a public function due to which the court had also rapped the Delhi Police, saying the incident was a “clear-cut case of security lapse” and the force did not behave responsibly in protecting him.A Republic Day celebration was organised at Chhatrasal Stadium in North Delhi here where the Delhi CM was a chief guest.“We are not allowing any fountain pens inside. If anybody is found to be carrying one during frisking he or she will be asked to leave it outside,” a security personnel said.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party had launched a scathing attack against the Delhi Police accusing it of security lapses over the ink attack on the Chief Minister.Later, Police Commissioner B S Bassi had rubbished the AAP's 'security lapse' allegations. — PTIOver 10 days ago, a woman had thrown ink on the Delhi CM raising security issues
