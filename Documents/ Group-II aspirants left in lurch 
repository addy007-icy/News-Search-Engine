Alleged delay in supply of study material and inadequate infrastructure facilities at the Telangana State Study Circle for Backward Classes here has become a cause for concern for candidates undergoing free coaching for the forthcoming Group-II examination at the State-run coaching institute.The BC study circle has been functioning from a rented building near NTR circle opposite Kakatiya University’s PG Centre in town since 2010. The institute has trained scores of unemployed youths belonging to weaker sections and helped them secure jobs in Revenue, Police and School Education and some other government departments, besides various public sector banks.The BC study circle has already initiated a four-month long camp to provide free coaching to the eligible unemployed youth of BC, SC and ST communities for Group-II exams and Group-I preliminary examination. It has drawn up plans to start separate coaching camps for DSC Teachers Recruitment examination and police constables recruitment test soon, sources added.“Although more than two months have elapsed since the coaching camp for Group-II examination began, we are yet to receive an assured free study material so far,” laments a trainee of the study circle, an aspirant of a Group-II job.The Group-II examination is slated to be held in April as per the notification issued by the TSPSC and the coaching camp is scheduled to end in little over a month, he points out, seeking anonymity.The State government should ensure prompt supply of study material, particularly on the newly-introduced topics like Telangana State history, geography, freedom fighters, culture and rituals to the unemployed youths, at the State-run study circles, suggests Kiran, an activist of the SFI town committee.The authorities have identified a site near SR&BGNR Government Degree and PG College for construction of building for the BC Study Circle, says G. Srilatha, Director, BC study circle, Khammam.Study material for the trainees of the ongoing coaching camp for Group-II examination is expected to arrive here from Hyderabad in a couple of days, she says.
