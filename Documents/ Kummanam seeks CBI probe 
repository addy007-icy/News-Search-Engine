BJP State president Kummanam Rajasekharan has sought an inquiry by the CBI into the bar bribery case that led to the resignation of Excise Minister K. Babu.Addressing reporters here in connection with the BJP’s Vimochana Yatra here on Sunday, Mr. Rajasekharan said the resignation of the Minister would never be a final solution to the big scam. “It was the Chief Minister who offered all support to Mr. Babu in the deal,” he alleged.“In the wake of the Vigilance court’s remarks about the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation team, there is no hope in believing that they would conduct a fair investigation in the case. Only a CBI investigation would be able to bring out the truth,” he said.Referring to the T.P. Chandrasekharan murder case, Mr. Rajasekharan said, “We will take all possible efforts to exert pressure on the Centre to take up the case. The conspiracy behind the murder has to be brought to light,” he said.
