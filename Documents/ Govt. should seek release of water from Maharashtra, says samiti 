Panchappa Kalburgi, irrigation activist and president of Bhima Nadi Neeru Horata Samiti, has demanded the government ensure the release of 15 tmcft of water from Maharashtra to Bhima river in Karnataka.Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, he said that as per the award of Bachawat Commission on inter-State water sharing, the Maharashtra government must release 15 tmcft of water from its reservoirs to Karnataka, which is a lower-riparian State.“With north Karnataka facing acute shortage of water in the prevailing drought, the government must work to get our share of water released from Maharashtra which is storing water in 14 dams without releasing water to us,” he said.Mr. Kalburgi said that even during the drought, some 14 reservoirs of Maharashtra had over 50 per cent water storage, while farmers of Karnataka cultivating on the banks of the Bhima are watching their crops withering away. He claimed that from May to October last year, Maharashtra has not released a single drop of water from its dams, though it was obligatory for the State to follow the direction of the Commission.He accused Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil of not being serious on the issue in getting the State’s share of water from Maharashtra.Stating that the former Minister, S.K. Krishna, during one such situation, had taken an all-party delegation to Maharashtra to get water released and had succeeded in his efforts, Mr. Kalburgi urged the government to take similar steps for getting the water released at least on a proportionate base, if Maharashtra cannot release the entire 15 tmcft of water owing to shortage. “The government has two options; either it should get the water by means of discussion or it should adopt a legal course by knocking the door of the Supreme Court, as getting water is the legal right of Karnataka,” he said.
