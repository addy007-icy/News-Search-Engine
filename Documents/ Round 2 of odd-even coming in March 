he Aam Aadmi Party government’s recently-concluded odd-even policy will be back in March, Transport Minister Gopal Rai has said.The AAP government is understood to be mulling the implementation of the second phase of the scheme after the CBSE board exam, scheduled for March, end.Speaking in the wake of a review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, underlined by an assessment of the results of the scheme, Mr. Rai identified two lacunae with regard to its provisions.These, he said, were the absence of a dependable fleet of State-run buses and the possibility of Delhiites purchasing a second car to bypass it. Mr. Rai made the announcement even as he credited the scheme for what he claimed was a documented dip both in pollution and congestion levels across the Capital.“With schools open, implementation of the scheme will lead to difficulties for parents dropping their children to school. Reports also suggest that drivers may buy another car. We are working on ways to address these concerns,” Mr. Rai said.The Transport Minister also announced that his department was in the process of procuring as many as 2,000 buses for induction into the Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) existing fleet. The Hindu had, in a report on December 28, highlighted the government’s plan to procure these as per the regulations of its cluster bus service scheme by mid-2016.“Around 1,000 buses will start coming on roads from April-June this year and 1,000 AC buses will be added by July-August,” the Minister said while adding that the government had also decided to introduce a ‘Premium Bus Service for the elite class’ with higher fares and relatively more comfort to popularise the use of State-run buses.At the moment, the DTC operates a fleet of around 6,200 buses of which 4,700 fall under the regular category while 1,500 are run under the cluster scheme. According to the DTC, the Corporation operated 5,216 buses in 2013-14 of which 2,506 buses were non air-conditioned, 1,275 were air conditioned and 1,435 were standard buses.The Delhi government has also floated a global Expression of Interest (EoI) tender for the procurement of feeder buses which, as and when inducted, will be deployed on routes where last-mile connectivity is a problem.
