Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the city for the International Fleet Review, a team from the Special Protection Group (SPG), led by an Additional Inspector-General rank officer, reached the city on Thursday to oversee the security arrangements at RK Beach and a few other areas in the city.The SPG is a special security force formed in 1988 for providing ‘proximate security’ to the Prime Minister, and former Prime Ministers and members of their immediate families.According to sources, the central security agencies are coordinating with each other and the State police to make the security arrangements as foolproof as possible.This aspect has heightened after the Goa Government received a letter, purportedly from the Islamic State (IS), last week threatening to harm the Prime Minister and a few others.The SPG officials, accompanied by District Collector N. Yuvaraj, Commissioner of Police Amit Garg, and senior police officials, inspected the RK Beach, where the Prime Minister would be reviewing the IFR events and addressing the people on February 7.Sources said that the SPG team also visited the INS Dega, INS Satavahana in the ENC and sailed in a boat from the fishing harbour to the RK Beach.
