A small portion of Ramakrishna Mutt Road near Kapaleeshwar temple tank in Mylpore is in a bad shape. According to some of the regular commuters who board buses at the bus stop near the tank, “The road caved in a few weeks ago; and though it has been covered, the patchwork has not been carried out properly. The surface is muddy and bumpy now.”According to S. Uthra Devi, an MTC commuter, “With a lot of dust swirling around every time a vehicle passes by, it is difficult to stand here and wait for a bus.”Similar complaints were made by vendors, shopkeepers and auto drivers.Another commuter, V. Nithya, says “The bumpy portion is located near the bus shelter. Due to this, the buses stop a few metres away from the designated stop.”A two-wheeler rider, V. Rukmani, says, “If we take this road, we cannot avoid this muddy surface. We have to slow down and be very careful; otherwise, the vehicle would skid.”It creates minor traffic snarls during rush hour. Meenakshi Sundaravalli, a resident of Mylapore, says, “Generally, this road is not congested. As a portion of the stretch is in a bad shape, vehicles move at a snail’s pace. So, I prefer to avoid this road during rush hour,”According to a Corporation official, “A cavity was formed due to drainage leakage and it has been closed. The stretch will be made even at the earliest.”
