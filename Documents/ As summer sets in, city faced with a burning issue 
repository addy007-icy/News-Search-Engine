With the rains receding and the summer setting in, the city is facing an increased risk of fire outbreaks.During the first 10 days of the New Year, most fire stations in the city have attended around eight to 10 calls reporting incidents of fire outbreak.The number of such calls is expected to go up as mercury soars in the coming months, fear Fire and Rescue Services personnel.The fire station at Thrikkakara has handled five major incidents of fire during the past few days. Personnel from this station and their colleagues from the nearby units had a tough time dousing a fire that broke out at a paddy field near Infopark and another one at Millumpadi.There was a case of a garbage heap catching fire at Thamannam near Palarivattom. The fire brigade also stepped in to bring under control the blaze that broke out at Thevakkal.While the fire stations at Tripunithura and Club Road attended eight calls each related to fire outbreaks during the last 10 days, the one at Gandhi Nagar deployed its men and machine to control nine cases of blaze.The risk of fire outbreak increases when atmospheric temperature shoots up and rain retreats.Dry foliageThe dry foliage and grass in abandoned and unattended plots pose major challenge to the fire fighters. The dry undergrowth catches fire quickly. If the fire breaks out in populated areas, it poses serious risk to life and property, said a fireman.There were also incidents of fire running out of control when the owners of the plot tried to clear the bushes by setting them on fire. The fire that breaks out in rubber plantations could become uncontrollable posing serious risks, he said.Depleting water sourcesThe depleting public water sources in the city are a matter of concern for the firemen as they need to travel long distances for filling the fire tenders. Firemen of Gandhi Nagar unit depend on a pond on the holding of Ernakulam Siva Temple when the well on the office premises dries up. Water from the backwaters could not be used as it would have turned saline during summer months. Saline water would lead to rusting, the fireman pointed out.
