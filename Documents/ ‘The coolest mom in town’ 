A corporate communications consultant, 51-year-old Shabnam Akram rode her first bike in 1978. Now, besides being a mother, she is the proud owner of a Royal Enfield Thunderbird Twinspark and happily confesses to having “lost count” of the number of bike trips she has taken so far.While her “adventurous spirit” still scares her parents, her husband not at all. In fact, it was he who taught her how “to tame the beast”.“Motorcycling gives you a real reason to wear leather, boots, gloves, and jackets. Secondly, men find women who ride exciting. Thirdly, you can identify insecure men easily. Besides, my children call me the coolest mom in town,” says Shabnam.
