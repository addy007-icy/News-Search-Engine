Sale of helmets has picked up pace in the city with the State government issuing a notification making it mandatory for pillion riders.While the price of ISI marked full face and open face helmets are around Rs. 1,000 per piece, helmets for children aged 10 and above are priced around Rs. 600 per piece.The notification came into effect on Tuesday.A dealer of an outlet in Balmatta said that more people were buying helmets since the publication of the notification.“But we are yet to see a peak in the sales,” he said. This outlet sells ISI marked full face and open face helmets. The helmets for children do not come with the ISI mark. “ISI marked helmets for children are not available,” he said.Another dealer of helmets in Kankanady said so far they were able to meet the demand.“We place fresh orders when our stock is around 50 per cent. So far there has not been any problem,” he said.The city police and the Transport Department officials initially will warn motorists who carry pillion riders without helmets. “Wearing helmets for pillion riders has been made mandatory and we will enforce it,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Shantakumar while brushing aside reports that the rule would be initially enforced only in Bengaluru.Mr. Shantakumar said that after a few days, the police would start imposing fine for violations.There was no exception for children from wearing helmets, he added. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime and Traffic) Sanjeev Patil said that a meeting of helmet dealers would be called soon to know the availability of helmets, especially those for children.However, the police did not make it clear from when they would start imposing fine.
