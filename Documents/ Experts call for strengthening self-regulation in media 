Experts in the field of media and mass communication underlined the imperatives of a strong ombudsman and effective self-regulation to restore credibility of the institution.They were participating in a discussion on ‘Ombudsman, Media and Responsibility’ as part of the two-day Global Communication Association’s 11{+t}{+h}India conference which commenced at the University of Mysore, on Thursday.At a panel discussion on ‘Is there an urgent need for a strong ombudsman to restore the credibility of Indian media,’ A.S. Paneeraselvan, Reader’s Editor, The Hindu, delivered the keynote address and called for a relook at the legal frameworks governing the media. He said that this had undergone profound changes in the last 20 years, while the governing rules of the industry were of colonial vintage.He said that the technological disruption and the convergence platform has been used by some to push for a mega- regulator for all forms of the media without realising the differences in the narrative logic of each of the media form.He said each media platform should have its own regulator as the problems are different.N. Bhaskar Rao, Founder Chairman, Centre for Media Studies, New Delhi, made a strong case for the return of the 'Journalist-Editor' to take centre-stage in the media, which was not the case today.He said that self -regulation was not as effective, but never before was the need for media ombudsman as strong as in present times.Dinesh Gundu Rao, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, said the country’s position in terms of free media was creditable.But, there was a general perception that the common man was getting fractured information and these worrying factors should be corrected by the media through self-regulation, he said.He supported the concept of a strong ombudsman in view of disturbing trends of paid news.The organisers said though media was being looked upon as an instrument of social change, it could also be misused by vested interests and the objective of the conference was to identify these challenges, find solutions and exchange knowledge.Vice-chancellor of the university K.S. Rangappa , GCA Chairman Yahya R. Kamalipour, Organising Secretary Krishna B. Mariyanka, and others were present on the occasion.
