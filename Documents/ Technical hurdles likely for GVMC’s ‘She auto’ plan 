The ambitious plan to introduce ‘She autos’ driven by women to increase safety levels is taking shape in the ongoing ‘Janmabhoomi-Maa Vooru’ programme.Applications from women are being accepted under the Employment through Skills Training and Placement (ESTP) under which skills will be imparted to the urban unemployed.Introducing women auto drivers is a part of the government’s plan to provide employment and empower women.AgreementThe Urban Community Development wing of GVMC will enter into an agreement with an agency under ESTP where payment to it will be made in instalments on the basis of biometric attendance and finally placement is provided. Until the beginning of the Janmabhoomi programme only 55 applications were received from two wards only. If the idea is to provide safe transport to women, it is important that applications should be received from all over the city. More applications are expected in the Janmabhoomi programme. A major hitch is getting licence for the drivers.However, the Motor Vehicle Act does not allow for issue of professional licence to the drivers immediately. Each driver has to first obtain a learner’s licence for non-transport auto. After a month, the permanent licence will be issued for non-transport autos which does not permit him/her to run auto as public transport.After one year, another learner’s licence has to be obtained for transport auto.After a month, the permanent licence finally allowing him/her to drive auto as public transport will be issued.In cases of violation of the Motor Vehicle Act in the city, about 20 per cent account for violation of the rules running autos on non-transport licence, according to sources.However, in spite of licensing hitches, the women drivers have to buy auto rickshaws obtaining bank loan and have to pay their EMIs.
