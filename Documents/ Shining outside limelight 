Contests in dance and group events garner the lion’s share of attention at art festivals, while others merely become a sideshow.However, this does not bother Sivaranjini G.B., a class 7 student of Government Upper Primary School, Palavila, Chirayinkeezhu. On Friday, Sivaranjini took part in Aksharaslokam, English recitation, and Malayalam elocution. She was hoping to improve her tally of two firsts in Sanskrit fete quiz and elocution on the first two days of the fete.Aparna Prabhakar, a class 7 student of Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, Cotton Hill, bagged first ‘A’ grade in Malayalam elocution in the upper primary section.Last year, Aparna had taken part in the monoact event and secured first ‘A’ grade.On a common note, Sivaranjini and Aparna had been selected children’s president and speaker at the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare’s Children’s Day celebrations this year.
