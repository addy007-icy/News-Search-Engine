As many as 64 farmers committed suicide in Mysuru district in the last six months. Of them, cases of 49 farmers had been placed before the committees, headed by assistant commissioners.The committees (two committees in Mysuru district) had approved 27 cases and awarded compensation to all the 27 families.However, they had rejected 18 cases on the basis that the farmers who committed suicide had no land in their name or had not availed loans from nationalised banks or societies. The committees were waiting for the FSL report in four other cases. As the government has modified the guidelines to enable families of all farmers who committed suicide to get compensation, most of the families are likely to get compensation.The compensation has been enhanced from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh each. The families that were rejected compensation on many grounds may again submit a fresh application along with necessary documents and claim compensation. It has also been decided that the remaining amount of Rs. 3 lakh will be due to families that had received Rs. 2 lakh compensation earlier.The compensation has been enhanced by the government from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh each
