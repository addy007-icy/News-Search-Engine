Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan and BJP leader V. Muraleedharan have come down on Chief Minister Oommen Chandy’s statement criticising the moves for talks between the RSS and the CPI(M) for talks to end clashes between workers of the two organisations.In separate statements here on Tuesday, the leaders hit out at Mr. Chandy accusing him of having misinterpreted the whole issue to reap political mileage. While Mr. Achuthanandan accused Mr. Chandy of having done so with the intention of covering up Congress’ overt and covert ties with the RSS and BJP over the years, Mr. Vijayan said Mr. Chandy’s desire appeared to be perpetuation of violent political conflicts.Mr. Muraleedharan said it was strange that Mr. Chandy alone wanted to see the rivers of blood continue to flow in Kannur. The CPI(M) response to the RSS chief’s statement for talks was a welcome development. Mr. Chandy’s statement was only intended to cover up the CPI(M)-Congress links, he said.
