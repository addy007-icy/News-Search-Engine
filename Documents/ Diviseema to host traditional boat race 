Nestled between Krishna and Bay of Bengal, Diviseema is all set to host a traditional boat race.Local residents, who are actively involved in the Swatchh Bharat campaign at Nagayalanka, are gearing up to organise the boat race on January 13, promising an ideal way of celebration of Pongal, apart from showcasing the hidden beauty of the rural tourism to the outsiders.“Most locals earn their livelihood through fishing. Women, too, use traditional boats here. Hence, it’s a festival of all,” said T. Raghu Sekhar an organisers of the race. “Invitations have been extended to interested teams to try their luck in the race. Each team should comprise five members including one navigator,” he added.“At least 20 teams Krishna district are expected to participate in the competitions. The participants need to row the boat for 1 km water-way between Nagayalanka village temple and river bank at Bobbarlanka in Guntur district,” Mr. Sekhar said.Venkatramayya Charitable Trust is extending necessary support for the race to be inaugurated by Deputy Speaker Mandali Buddha Prasad. According to local youths, Nagayalanka should be known for boat race in coming years, as the tag will help Diviseema to tap its tourism potentiality. In 2015 January, the local youths conducted a boat race at Nagayalanka, but it missed the traditional touch, as engine boats were allowed to participate in the race.There is no registration fee. For registration, one may contact 9490577899. For the record, the Forest Department authorities had conducted toddy trunk boat race in Kolleru Lake in February, 2015, marking the World Wetland Day, and it received huge response.
