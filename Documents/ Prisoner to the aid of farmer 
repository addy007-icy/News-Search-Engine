The inmates of the open jail at Nettukaltheri, Thiruvananthapuram, are doing their bit for the coconut farmer, whose fortunes are forever uncertain. They are raising high-yielding coconut seedlings in the compound of the open jail, under a tie-up between the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) and the jail.The collaboration has been successful and the few thousand seedlings raised in the initial phase have already been distributed to farmholds.The institute aims at doubling the production this year. Efforts are under way to expand the area under seedling development, according to B. Krishnakumar, head of ICAR-CPCRI, Kayamkulam.The open jail at Nettukaltheri has over 470 acres of land where horticulture and animal husbandry are taken up with the inmatesâ€™ help.The government agencies have been replacing old coconut palms with disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties. Dwarf ones have been recommended for Kerala where coconut harvesting from tall palms has been posing problems due to non-availability of expert climbers.Two disease-resistant varieties, namely Kalpa Raksha and Kalpa Sree, and one disease-tolerant hybrid called Kalpa Sankara, have been developed by the institute for management of rootwilt disease, a major threat to farming. Chowghat Orange Dwarf, Kalpa Surya and Kalpa Jyothi were among the dwarf varieties developed by the scientists of the institute. A total of 38,700 quality seedlings and hybrids were distributed to farmers in the past seven years, Mr. Krishnakumar said.High-yielding coconut seedlings are being raised by inmates of an open jail for distribution among farmers.
