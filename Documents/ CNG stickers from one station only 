: After terming its implementation successful for the fourth successive day, Transport Minister Gopal Rai said specially-issued CNG stickers in line with its regulations would now only be available from a single Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) station located in south Delhi's CGO Complex from Wednesday.Stating that CNG stickers were so far being distributed at 95 CNG stations in Delhi and another 19 in the National Capital Region (NCR) – leading to the distribution of 3.90 lakh of these despite there being 3.50 lakh registered vehicles running on the fuel in the Capital alone – instances of these being 'sold' were also surfacing.Mr. Rai quoted one such report about one Dipak Sen from Vivek Vihar being caught red-handed and later admitting to selling a sticker to a petrol vehicle for Rs. 2,800, which has led to the registration of a criminal case by the IGL against him.IGL director V Nagarajan said that proper arrangements will be made at CGO Complex CNG station so that people do not face any problem in getting the stickers.Mr. Rai said the instance had also led to his department issuing directions to execute random checks of vehicles bearing the IGL-issued sticker. Meanwhile, the Minister said that the Transport Department was running 7,143 buses on its own and had decided to “stop talking and requesting schools to provide buses”.He also added that the helpline number of his department received 700 calls on Tuesday, and that the PoochO app was downloaded 7,000 more time for a total of 32,000 downloads so far.Referring to “controversy” over congestion at Rajiv Chowk Metro station on Monday, Mr. Rai said that those who circulated “fake” photos on social media realised their fault and it was not a “panic situation”.“I myself went to Rajiv Chowk station today. The data of past five Mondays, revealed that on an average 28,25,979 commute by Metro trains on Mondays. The number of those who travelled by Metro yesterday (Monday) was 28,19,657,” he said.Mr. Rai added that a premier bus service with the facility of pre-booking will soon start, and that trials are being conducted for CCTV cameras, wi—fi and GPS aboard all buses.
