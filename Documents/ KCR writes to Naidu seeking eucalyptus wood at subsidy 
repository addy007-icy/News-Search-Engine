Deputy Chief Minister Kadiam Srihari and Tribal Welfare Minister A. Chandulal on Wednesday personally handed over to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu a letter written by his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao seeking supply of eucalyptus wood grown in Andhra Pradesh at a subsidised price for Ballarpur Industries located at Kamalapur in Warangal district.Mr. Rao highlighted in the letter that the government and elected representatives have been taking initiatives to revive the factory which was shutdown in 2014 by providing certain concessions. One of them was supply of wood at a subsidised price for a period of five years.The factory was engaged in manufacture of Viscose grade Rayon with wood as raw material. The industry sourced wood during the initial period from the forest department and, thereafter, used eucalyptus and bamboo grown by farmers. The undivided AP Forest Development Corporation was the major source of supply of wood for the industry.The industry participated in auction and bought about five lakh tonnes of wood per annum from the corporation. It faced severe constraints, one of them being non-availability of wood at an affordable price, which led to its closure for the last six months.Mr. Rao also said there was potential to raise only 1.25 lakh tonnes of wood per annum in Telangana after bifurcation. A substantial quantity of eucalyptus wood was available in AP.Chief Minister highlights the initiatives being taken to revive Ballarpur Industries at Kamalapur in Warangal district
