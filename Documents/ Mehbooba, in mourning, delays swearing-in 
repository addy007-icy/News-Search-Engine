Jammu and Kashmir is likely to undergo a spell of Governor’s rule this weekend as prospective Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, president of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Friday remained in a state of mourning, and would likely take oath only on Monday.The delay till Monday set off speculation that the BJP could use the time to put forward certain conditions of support.However, party general secretary Ram Madhav who had helped midwife the PDP-BJP alliance in the State remained tight-lipped.“We cannot reveal details right now. The media will be informed at the appropriate time,” Mr. Madhav said just before a meeting with party MLAs at the Srinagar Circuit House.It was Mehbooba’s own decisionPeoples Democratic Party leaders insisted that it was prospective Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti’s own decision to delay the oath-taking ceremony.“She is a very traditional woman. She is an affectionate daughter and is not in the right frame of mind to participate in the swearing-in ceremony. It may take a little longer than expected,” senior PDP leader Nayeem Akhtar told The Hindu. Ms. Mufti remained at her residence all day and received sympathisers and relatives.The party is observing chahrum (culmination of the four-day mourning as per traditions) of the late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed — former chief minister, who died in New Delhi on Thursday morning — on January 10. It is only after that will Ms. Mufti be sworn in as first woman Chief Minister of J&K, said party sources.
