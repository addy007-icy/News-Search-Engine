: A prolonged lull this winter season has led to a sharp downfall in sales of room heaters in the city. Although the demand for room-heating equipments picked up in mid December, the unusually warm weather that followed has pushed down its sales by up to 80 per cent, claim traders.Most traders in the city rued that they have been badly hit by a sudden decline in demand for heaters and blowers. At Old Delhi’s Bhagirath Palace, a market for electrical products, the heating units that had been stocked up in anticipation of a heavy demand are now gathering dust. In just a matter of a year, Sameep Chowdhury saw the demand for heaters at his shop fall by 80 per cent. He was waiting for the chill to set in, before he could display an array of heating equipments.Sitting by the entrance of his shop in a narrow lane, the 52-year old said, “Sales have been at a five-year low this season with only one per cent of our total stock sold. There is no biting cold this time and people are enjoying the pleasant weather.”Similar stories echoed from other markets. For Prabha Gaur and her husband who run a store at Karol Bagh, everything but heaters are selling. Recounting the last three years when “people lined up in front of the shop to buy room heaters, even before they could be unloaded from truck," the 54-year old said, adding that she has been able to sell only four to five units in January so far.The plight of store owners at Laxmi Nagar is similar. “Nearly 80 per cent of our sales have been hit. Everything from extension cords to lights are being sold, but the demand for heaters are not picking up,” said Guatam Raj, whose had a shop here for 30 years. The 48-year-old barely managed to sell two units last week. Around the same time last year, he would sell 25 room heaters on an average.(The author is an intern with The Hindu )
