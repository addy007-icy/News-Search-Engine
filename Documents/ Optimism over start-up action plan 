C, CEO, Kerala Startup Mission, welcomed the tax exemption and the Rs.10,000 crore-fund for the promotion of start-ups but wanted to know the finer details of its utilisation pattern.He hailed the easy exit route for the failed ventures but wondered about the mechanism to verify whether the exit was on legitimate grounds.Sanjay Vijayakumar, chairman Startup Village, said that the compliance regime based on self-certification will ease the regulatory burden on start-ups.“Ease of shutting down will encourage risk taking and Private- Public-Participation model incubators, such as Startup Village, and will get a huge boost with the additional funding announced,” Mr. Vijayakumar noted.Joseph C. Mathew, IT Advisor to the former chief minister, said that the plan, especially the provision for tax exemption, has been put in place without learning the lessons from the previous mistakes from a similar attempt under the Software Technology Parks of India Scheme.Tax exemptionHe said that there was the possibility of start-ups benefitting from the three-year tax exemption by forming a new start-up towards the end of the third year to extent that tax holiday by transferring its existing operations to the new entity.“So, effectively the tax exemption would not lead to a quantum jump in exports, projects or jobs. It would only enable the government to make tall claims about the proliferating start-ups, but at the cost of considerable tax loss,” Mr. Mathew said.FundingAbdullah. P, Associate Professor and Director of the Cochin University of Science and Technology’s technology business incubator, Centre for Innovation, Technology Transfer and Industrial Collaboration, said that it remained to be seen how the funding would benefit student entrepreneurs.“It is vital that some seed fund is made available to student entrepreneurs or at least a loan scheme is created out of the new funds,” Mr. Abdullah said.
