Uma Pansare writes to govtThe wife of slain Communist leader Govind Pansare has written a letter to the stateâ€™s Home Department seeking appointment of Special Public Prosecutor in the ongoing murder case of Pansare. In her letter Uma Pansare has stressed the need for a strong Special Public Prosecutor by drawing parallels between the killings of Pansare, rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and MM Kalburgi. The letter says the trial is one which has far-reaching implications, and hence there is a need to appoint a senior prosecutor.
