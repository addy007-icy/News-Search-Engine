It was a happy ending for 50 life convicts who were pardoned and released from the Central Prison here on Tuesday.However, it was remorse for the unlucky six life convicts whose applications for pardon had been turned down by the State government.Six applications“The six life convicts whose applications for pardon were not considered by the government should not lose hope of an early release as their applications may be reconsidered in the next round. The release of 50 life convicts should send strong signals to other convicts that their good behaviour in prison would get them reprieve from prison sentence,” said Principal District and Sessions Judge B.V. Patil while handing over the release orders to the lucky 50 prisoners.An atmosphere of bonhomie prevailed in the prison complex with fellow convicts congratulating the lucky 50 who are bound for a fresh life outside prison after spending more than 14 years inside the four walls.Many released prisoners were seen shedding tears while parting company with their friends and the prison officials, including guards.The released prisoners included six members of a same family from Masarkal village in Deodurg taluk in Raichur district, life convicts from Shikaripur in Shivamogga district, K.R. Pet in Mandya, Bengaluru, Bidar, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Yadgir and Kalaburagi districts.Syed Haji (35), one of the six brothers who had spent more than 14 years in Kalaburagi prison and released on Tuesday, said, “Half my life has gone… except my brother Syed Mehboob, none of us brothers married as we had lost all hopes of going out of prison. But the release now has come as a silver lining to restart our life afresh.”Syed Haji and his brothers were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for murdering their uncle Syed Yousuf Sab over a land dispute. While some of the prisoners owned some land and have assured chances of restarting their life afresh, a few prisoners who were released did not own any land or property.Channabasappa Murari of Shanabur in Yadgir district and Sanna Siddapa of Kodla village in Sedam taluk in Kalaburagi district said that they did not know what the future holds for them and how they will able to restart their life without any land or other source of income.The judge, Mr. Patil, in a word of caution to the released prisoners, said that the situation and people may provoke them to commit fresh crime, but the reformed prisoners should desist from falling into the trap and face challenges of life with confidence.Deputy Commissioner Vipul Bansal, Superintendent of Police Amit Singh, and Chief Superintendent of Prison M. Somashekar were present at the time of the release of the prisoners.
