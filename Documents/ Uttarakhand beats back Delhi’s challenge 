Uttarakhand overcame a fighting Delhi unit to emerge a 76-65 winner in the 66th Senior National basketball championship, at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium, here on Sunday.Uttarakhand, the defending champion, slipped to a 18-4 deficit early, with Delhi's speedy guards Sachin Sharma and Pravin Dovan running the show. The duo harried their bigger opponents by running into open spaces and taking uncontested shots.It was up to India captain and Uttarakhand’s star player Vishesh Bhriguvanshi to keep his team alive. In the second quarter, Bhriguvanshi began to drive to the basket aggressively and was effective on the fast-break as well.Uttarakhand eventually took the lead — for the first time in the match — in the third quarter. Sharpshooter Trideep Rai (17 points) and Murali Krishna (12) too started to find their range, taking Delhi out of the contest.Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, banked primarily on its centres — Annadurai Aravind (24) and Rikin Pethani (15) — to ease past Services 83-59. The favourite has now won both its fixtures.In the women's section, Poonam Chaturvedi scored a remarkable 52 points to guide Chhattisgarh to 84-60 victory against Madhya Pradesh.The 6'9" Poonam ensured that the title holder made amends for a loss to Kerala on Saturday.Host Karnataka succumbed to a second-straight defeat, going down 78-67 to Delhi.
