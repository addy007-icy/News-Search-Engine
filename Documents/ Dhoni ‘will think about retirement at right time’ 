India’s limited-overs captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday said he will think about quitting the game at the “right time”. In fact, the 34-year-old Dhoni was asked the same question about his retirement after India’s exit from ICC World Cup 2015 and he had then denied that he had such plan.The calls to have Virat Kohli captain in all three formats have grown louder as his attacking instincts in the longer format has impressed many.Adding to it, Dhoni’s form with the bat in the last one year hasn’t exactly been great. There are rumours that he might take a call after the ICC World T20 in India.On the eve of team’s departure for Australia, Dhoni was asked about retirement.“I am a person who lives in the present and the focus right now is the Australian tour leading up to the World T20 Championships. I will think about it at the right time,” he said.
