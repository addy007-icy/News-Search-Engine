Two weeks ago, the State government declared the hilly forests of Jogimatti — where jackals, wolves, sloth bears and leopards roam amidst windmills — as a wildlife sanctuary.The notification, which sees 100.48 sq km of grasslands and shrub forests, converts the erstwhile reserve forest into a sanctuary. Officials said while existing windmills will not be touched, the sanctuary will ensure no new projects in the ecologically sensitive area, which is dubbed as the ‘Ooty of Dryland’.On the importance of declaring the sanctuary, the notification says that the contiguous reserve forests form an important catchment for tanks and lakes in the region, while also harbouring species protected under the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act such as porcupine, civets, jungle cat, and wolves, among others.
