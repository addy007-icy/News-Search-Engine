The Youth Congress on Tuesday protested against the Delhi government’s ongoing odd-even experiment, saying that pollution levels had only increased since the trial began on January 1.Workers of the Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress held a dharna at Durgapur Chowk in Babarpur to “expose the real face of the government”, according to an official statement. Shouting slogans against the government, they burned an effigy of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. DPYC president Amit Malik said: “The government is fooling people by taking Rs.1,500 for a CNG sticker. So-called volunteers are been given a huge sum of money at the taxpayer’s expense.”He added that pollution had been increasing daily, while the CM was “praising himself” through ads.
