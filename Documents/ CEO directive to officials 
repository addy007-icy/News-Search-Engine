State Chief Electoral Officer Bhanwar Lal has directed officials to take up electoral revision in such a manner that all the members of a family can vote in one polling station.Addressing officials at a meeting here on Monday, Mr. Bhanwar Lal directed Municipal Commissioner S. Ravindra Babu to take steps to streamline door numbers. Polling stations should be finalised ward-wise, he said.It was cumbersome for the electoral officials to survey and ascertain the door numbers of persons who have shifted to different houses and such cases should be properly verified and finalised by March-end, District Collector Ch. Vijayamohan said.The electoral lists to be prepared should be useful for both Assembly and Parliamentary elections as well, the CEO said.
