CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan has alleged that the suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit research scholar at the University of Hyderabad, is the fallout of the Sangh Parivar’s ostracism and intolerance towards Dalits across the country.Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Nava Kerala March he is leading, Mr. Vijayan said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was against both the minorities and the Dalits.The suicide of the Dalit research scholar reflected the tragic impact of the intolerance and injustice being shown to Dalits by policies inspired by the Sangh Parivar.He demanded that legal action be initiated against Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya and the University of Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor in connection with the suicide of the student.The CPI(M) leader also said that the High Court’s observation that the Vigilance and Anti-corruption Bureau (VACB) was not vigilant was disgraceful to the State. He said that Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala and the government should take total responsibility for the adverse remarks by the court.The court’s remarks only endorsed the people’s experience, he pointed out. He said that 396 Adivasi families at Aralam were living in panic as they are facing the threat of attack by wild animals. The government should have provided adequate fence around the Aidvasi rehabilitation areas at Aralam to make the plots given to the Adivasis cultivable.Mr. Vijayan said in response to a question that the CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF are the main contestants in the forthcoming Assembly election. The BJP is not a force in the State, he said. He added that the Oommen Chandy-led government is lending assistance to the BJP to open its account in the State Assembly by pursuing a policy of mutual help.The CPI(M)’s liquor policy is neither to increase liquor consumption in the State nor to enforce total prohibition, he said in response to a question. The LDF’s stand is that promoting abstention through awareness creation is a better option than prohibition, he said.HC remarks about VACB disgrace to State: PinarayiAccuses UDF govt. of assisting BJP to win seat
