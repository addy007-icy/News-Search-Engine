Large hoardings and banners wishing local MLA N.A. Harris on the occasion of his 48 birthday adorned the streets of Shantinagar on Tuesday. His supporters did not just limit themselves to hoardings. They even erected temporary arches with temple gopuram-like structures flanked by life-size photographs of Mr. Harris. Similar hoardings have come up near the Chief Ministerâ€™s residential office Krishna too.No permission has been taken from the BBMP advertisement division to put up the structures. K Mathai, Assistant Commissioner, Advertisement section, BBMP, said they would take action and remove illegal hoardings if a citizen lodged a complaint with the civic body.Repeated attempts to contact Mr. Harris failed.
