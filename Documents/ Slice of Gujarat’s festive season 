: Uttarayan, the beginning of the journey of the sun to the northern hemisphere, the beginning of spring, the beginning of the harvest season, is an auspicious time across the country. As for Gujaratis, it is the time for kites. For centuries, Gujaratis have been welcoming the spring with kite festivals and kite flying competitions. It continues to be a bi-affair in Gujarat till this date.However, the second generation of Gujaratis who have settled in other parts of the State are not well aware of the event or its significance. Hence, the Gujarati community in Kozhikode took it upon themselves to emulate the celebration in Kozhikode, their home away from home.The first-ever Uttarayan, the festival of kites was held at the Sri Gujarati Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School in Kozhikode on Sunday with an aim to create awareness among the new generation about the festivities.The new District Police Chief of Kozhikode Uma Meena Behra inaugurated the festival in which more than 400 people of various communities took part.
