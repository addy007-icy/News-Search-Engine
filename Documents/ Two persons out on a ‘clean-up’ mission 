Two individuals, a German teacher and an organic farmer, who were troubled by the mounting waste in the city streets have started an initiative ‘Kerala – My own country’ to fight the problem.In the past one month since they started out, they have with the help of their friends, well-wishers and other volunteers, cleaned up the road leading to Cantonment house and the Varkala cliff and beach.The next step in their campaign will be the cleaning up of the Shanghumugham beach on January 9 from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. They have named the campaign ‘Our waste needs a home’.Solutions“We cannot clean the entire city. We are instead offering solutions for specific spots, which could serve as a model to be followed at other parts of the city. Our focus will be on tackling the ‘throwing away’ culture that is prevalent here. Most of the citizens do not wish to litter or pollute, but are throwing away the garbage because no waste bins are provided in most of the public places. We have to create a feeling that this is their own place and so it’s their own need to keep it clean,” says Jennifer Nausch from Hamburg, who teaches German at the Goethe Zentrum here.She is running the campaign along with S.J. Sanjeev from Peroorkada, an organic farmer.One of the aims of the campaign is to raise awareness through interactions with the people in the area, through providing them with information about successful ways of waste treatment in Kerala.The two of them have visited various places, including Attingal, where successful waste management programmes are being implemented.Students and volunteers have already expressed interest in helping them out for the beach cleanup.To attract public attention and to make the clean up more fun, they have planned on activities including games and art.After cleaning up, they plan to put a box to dump waste near the beach area. The two of them have held talks with the civic body and other government officials to take the programme forward.
