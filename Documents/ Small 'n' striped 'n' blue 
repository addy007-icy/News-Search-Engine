Have you ever spotted a small butterfly with a wingspan of about 28 mm, which has white and brown stripes on its underside? It’s called the Zebra Blue butterfly as it resemble the zebra’s stripes.Its other name is Plumbago Blue, as its larva feed on the blue flowering plumbago plant that makes wonderful shrubs for hedges.Savitha Ravi, who lives in Bengaluru North says, “I have tried to rear the caterpillars of zebra blue many a time and just before pupating, they would disappear from the plant. I learnt from a professional that the butterflies in the family of Lycainidae don’t pupate on the host plant. Instead, I saw their pupa on the wall and twice they were devoured by spiders.”After going for a butterfly walk in J.P. Nagar, conducted by Rohit Girotra, Savitha says she never took pictures of them as they were comparatively faster with an “erratic flight path. I started shooting them only after I went for the walk,” she adds.Vinithashri Gautam, who photographs them, explains, “The Leptotes plinius, commonly known as Zebra blue or Plumbago blue is a Lycaenid butterfly. It will be easy to photograph them sitting on good nectar providing flowers. As they are small and difficult to photograph, waiting for them to settle on a flower to feed, is the best way to get a good picture.”Rohit Girotra, who takes butterfly lovers out for butterfly walks in the city says, “The Zebra blue, is a small butterfly and not one that can be identified in flight. You need to wait and let it settle down to get a good look at its patterns, which are distinct from other butterflies to be able to identify them.”If you take a walk towards the outer edges of the city where wild flowers still grow, you will sure find the Zebra Blue flitting among the flowers and stopping periodically to sip nectar.These butterflies are commonly seen on the outskirts of the city, but seem to have been lost in the built up areas of Bengaluru.
