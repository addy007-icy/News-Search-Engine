Improving ease of doing business is critical to West Bengal attracting investment. It is also necessary to ensure that the ‘industry-friendly’ policies percolate down the government hierarchy right till the district-level, according to Arindam Guha, Senior Director, Deloitte in India.In an exclusive interaction, Mr. Guha said while ease of doing business reforms have happened in specific departments like online taxation, the agenda seems to be an unfinished one. “There should be a common investor-interface (States such as A.P., Punjab have already done this) which actually operates on ‘Single Window’ concept,” he said.Asked to assess the recent Bengal Global Summit, he said majority of the proposals seem to be public sector project investments.Anchor investors like The Chatterjee Group and Mitsubishi Chemicals Corporation have also seen their issues being addressed. This may facilitate investments in those areas (petrochemicals and chemicals). There was also talk of taking back unutilised land from industry.He felt that bottlenecks in implementation need to be removed to help fructify the projects.On the contentious issue of land, the government is now adopting a strategy of industrial park / cluster-led development around land already available with the government or private investors.The State should ideally follow a two-pronged strategy of generating services led employment (medical and health related, private education hubs, IT & ITeS etc) in the districts in and around Kolkata supplemented by manufacturing in the western districts like Purulia where agriculture is not lucrative as a livelihood option, he said.Land is also available in this belt and it also enjoys proximity to mineral reserves of Jharkhand.
