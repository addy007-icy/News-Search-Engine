Milan would love to travel all over Europe, but the air fare might cost him an arm and a leg.Laksh had to pay an arm and a leg to settle the hospital bill.Milan is thinking of exchanging an arm and a leg for his travel plans and Laksh is doing the same to settle the hospital bill. Sounds terrible and barbaric, doesn’t it?Amputate?Relax. There’s nothing strange happening here. The idiom ‘ cost an arm and a leg’ means that some things are so expensive that they are painful to buy, and may cost you everything you have.Eg: “You have to pay a lot of money to give your children a good education nowadays. A place in a top university would cost you an arm and a leg!”Some say this phrase was coined sometime after World War II when many servicemen had lost an arm and a leg in the war. It is thus possible that the phrase originated in reference to the high cost paid by those wounded servicemen.
