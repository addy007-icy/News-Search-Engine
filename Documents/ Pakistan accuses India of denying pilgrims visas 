Pakistan on Monday accused India of violating the 1974 Pilgrim Protocol after India denied visa to 74 pilgrims from Pakistan.“These pilgrims belonging to various parts of Pakistan have expressed resentment over the rejection of their visas. They were travelling to attend the annual gathering of Hafiz Abdullah Shah shrine near Agra from 11-18 January,” the Pakistan High Commission stated in a press release. Pakistan, the press release said, had not stopped pilgrims from India and had been issuing visas to them in accordance with the 1974 Protocol.However, official sources told The Hindu that the shrine of Hafiz Abdullah Shah did not have an organising committee, which was essential for inviting and hosting pilgrims and for making necessary arrangements during their visit.The latest episode of denial of visas to Pakistani pilgrims is being perceived as a setback to the agenda of the Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue even before it could formally begin with the Foreign Secretary-level talks on January 15. The issue of a smooth visa procedure for Indian and Pakistani pilgrims featured most recently in the Indo-Pak Joint Statement that followed the December 9, 2015, meeting between External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistan counterpart Sartaj Aziz in Islamabad.
