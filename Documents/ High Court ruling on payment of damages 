The Madras High Court Bench here on Monday ordered assessment of damage suffered by residents of Tuticorin district due to recent floods and payment of compensation/flood relief, as paid to those in Chennai.Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran passed the interim order on a public interest litigation petition filed and argued by Puthiya Tamilagam president K. Krishnasamy accusing officials of not having done much to alleviate the sufferings of flood victims.The judges directed Tuticorin Collector to constitute special teams for the purpose of identifying the flood victims and holding camps in all villages for collecting applications and verifying the veracity of claims before arriving at the quantum of money required for paying compensation.Thereafter, the Collector was ordered to communicate the requirement to the State government and obtain sanction for the funds. He was further directed to address the issue of repairing roads other than those within Corporation limits for which Rs.8 crore had already been sanctioned.The judges said that an action taken report, explaining the progress made by the district administration on the basis of their interim orders, should be filed in the court by January 28. Earlier, Mr. Krishnasamy told the court that the Collector had so far received only around 5,700 petitions seeking compensation though he, in his capacity as Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Ottapidaram constituency, had received over 12,000 petitions.He also stressed the need to repair rain-ravaged roads and claimed that children living in remote villages were unable to go to school owing to bad roads.
