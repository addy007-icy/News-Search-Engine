MS Dhoni may be against Spidercam, but it is here to stay. In fact, chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC) David Richardson said here on Thursday that the aerial gadget will be used during the ICC World T20, to be hosted in India from March 8 to April 3.“Yes, we are going to use Spidercam during the World T20 championship. We will make sure it does not interfere with play. We have guidelines for its usage,” Richardson the former South Africa wicketkeeper said at a promotional event of its new global partner, Chinese cellphone manufacturer Oppo.The Spidercam had interfered with play during the fifth and final one-dayer between Australia and India in Sydney last week. India was denied a boundary in the 19th over when a Virat Kohli shot hit the gadget, thereby prompting the umpires to call it a dead ball.“He was probably our best fielder tonight, Spidercam. He saved four,” Australia skipper Steve Smith later said. — Special Correspondent
