Bhuvaneswari said that due to poor management, the civic body was cash-strapped as it was unable to pay the contractors and the salary for the corporation workers regularly.“Though it has engineers and workers for operating and maintaining, what is the need for appointing a contractor at a huge cost,” she said.She said that corruption was prevailing in the corporation and people were the worst affected due to non-implementation of welfare schemes in the last four years.Corporation officials said that inadequate man power for operating and maintaining the scheme had forced them to go for appointing a contractor.
