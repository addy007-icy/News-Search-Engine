In a double-overtime thriller, Tamil Nadu edged out Karnataka 88-85 in the women’s section of the Senior national basketball championship here on Tuesday.The wildly fluctuating encounter finished 74-all at the end of regulation time, before a last-ditch three-pointer from Karnataka’s Supritha levelled the score at 81.The teams then went into a second period of extra-play, even as the crowd at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium went delirious.With the clock ticking down on the second overtime period, an unlikely hero emerged.Tamil Nadu’s V. Srividhya — who was on the court for a total of just two minutes — drained a baseline jumper to take her side ahead by one point.Karnataka was unable to make anything of its final attacking foray, and watched the opponents run down the clock to seal the fate of the match.Telangana throughIn another fixture, Chhattisgarh’s belief that star player Poonam Chaturvedi can single-handedly guide the side to victory failed to bear fruit, with the defending champion falling short against Telengana here on Tuesday.The 6'9" Poonam scored 46 points and grabbed 19 rebounds, but this exceptional return could not prevent the side from losing its second league match in four outings.Poonam took nearly half of Chhattisgarh’s field-goal attempts, and converted at an impressive rate. However, her teammates — with the exception of Saranjeet Kaur (18 pts) - did not provide adequate support. Telangana, on the other hand, spread the ball around more evenly.Forward P. Divya (23 pts), guard Aishwarya Nataraj (18 pts) and centre Anusha Anto (19 pts, 14 pts) all played their part to take Telangana to its third straight win.Telengana and Chhattisgarh both advanced to the quarterfinal stage, with Kerala also booking a knockout spot from this Group ‘A’.Uttarakhand downs HaryanaAmong the men, title-holder Uttarakhand put it across Haryana 83-55 in a one-sided affair.The trusted trio of Murali Krishna, Trideep Rai and Vishesh Bhriguvanshi ran circles around Haryana, which fell out of contention after a poor second-quarter.The results:Level 1: Men: Railways 94 (S.
