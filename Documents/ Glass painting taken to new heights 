It is the perception of an artist that determines the limits of any medium. Anyone with an artistic thumb would have experimented on glass painting at least once in their life. But no one has taken it to the level that Ambily has. She has used the medium dextrously for some serious art; the award-winning type.Liquid Form-7, the seventh solo exhibition of glass paintings by Ambily that began at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Art Gallery in Kozhikode on Thursday, is noteworthy just for the medium she has used. For a first-time visitor, it seemed hard to digest that this particular medium, which has been used as just a hobby idea by amateur artists so far, did have so much possibilities.“I haven’t been a serious artist before I got acquainted with glass paints. But this medium had me fascinated from the beginning and eventually I spent 12 years perfecting it to suit my requirements”, said Ambily, a mother of two and a resident of Kozhikode.Most of her works are similar to what you find in an interior designing catalogue, but in glass. Then there are quite a few designs she created, which have been executed very painstakingly, with perfection. She has overcome many limitations of the medium by just being patient. “It takes around one month to complete some of these works. Then it takes more than two weeks to get them dried. The paint does not stay put unless the glass is very clean. And for all the pain in creating it, just one jerk is enough to break it,” Ambily says.Mosaic is the leitmotifMosaic is a signature style for this artist, which she has used in quite a number of paintings.Though not competent in the Kerala mural style, she has tried experimenting with the style using glass paints and it has come out magnificent with some light in the background. She has used textured glass as a second layer to provide a unique feel to the works.
