Acting on the directions of the Delhi High Court, the Indian Olympic Association has sought feedback from its state units to take a decision on giving recognition to either Boxing India or Indian Amateur Boxing Federation though both have been de-recognised by the world body, AIBA.A single bench of the High Court, in its November 11, 2015 decision, has asked the IOA to take a decision in this regard by January 31.The court also asked the BI to apply to IOA for recognition by November 27 last while IABF is already recognised by the country’s apex body of sports.The IOA, on its part, has written to its state Olympic associations to communicate with it on which out of the two- BI and IABF — was working for the benefit of boxing.“In furtherance of the order passed by Honourable Delhi High Court in W.P. (C) No. 7874 of 2015, you are requested to kindly get back to us after finding out from your respective state boxing association as to whether which out of the two i.e. BI or IABF is working for the benefit of boxing and boxers in your respective state preferably within a period of one week,” the IOA said in a letter to its state units.“…so that decision with regard to the directions given by Hon’ble Delhi High Court in the above judgement may be made by 31.01.2016 and communicated as per directions,” it added.The IOA also asked the state Olympic associations to provide a copy of Registration Certificate of the Boxing Association with Registrar of Societies if their respective states.The High Court had also directed the Sports Ministry, which was also a party in the case, to consider the decision of the IOA and decide before March 15 on which body should be recognised as the National Sports Federation for boxing.The development may lead to another round of uncertainty in the sport as the world body AIBA is not bound to give affiliation to the body recognised by the IOA or the government.The AIBA currently recognised an ad-hoc body constituted under its direction and Indian boxers are allowed to participate in the international events under its banner.
