The Delhi government may be taking credit for “reduced” pollution levels as a consequence of its odd-even car policy, but figures from the Central government suggest that in the first week of January last year, the concentration of PM 2.5 — the most dreaded of primary particulate matter pollutants — over Delhi was significantly lower than last year.Data from SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), the pollution monitoring network of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, as well as from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), show that PM 2.5 levels were on average half the levels of this year.Weather-wise so far, January has been unusually warm on account of a range of meteorological factors —from lack of rain and skewed wind flow — that also are a result of a raging El Nino, a weather phenomenon that leads to warmer surface waters over the Pacific and consequently droughts over India and generally-warmer winters.The Delhi government told the High Court on Friday that the peak levels of PM showed a decrease from January 1, when the odd-even experiment began. The report, compiled by the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), says that peak pollution recorded during the odd-even experiment has been the lowest compared to those in earlier smog episodes this winter. Except for January 1 last year, when PM (2.5) levels shot to 280 micrograms/cubic metre, particulate matter levels dramatically dipped to as much as 80 and never surpassed 150 micrograms/cubic metre. Similar trends from last year were borne out by figures from the CPCB, though only data from one station was available from their website for the week of Jan1-Jan 8, 2015.To be sure, PM2.5 is only one of a range of pollutants including PM 10 and nitrous oxides that are considered hazardous to health and it is possible for individual pollutants to have dramatically varying concentrations within a single day.Meteorologists say that Delhi weather last January was “fairly typical,” though there were some factors that may have helped reduce pollution. Average maximum temperatures between the January 1-8, spanned from 14.5 degrees Celsius to 21 degrees Celsius and minimum temperatures ranged from 6.4 degrees Celsius to 12 degrees Celsius, and thus colder than temperatures last week.Moreover, there were at least three spells of rain — unlike this year which has been bereft of rain — as well as fog on January 7 and 8 according to Skymet, a private weather forecasting company based out of Delhi. For pollution to abate, rains have to settle the dust and pollutants and north-westerly winds must blow them away to Central India and beyond.“That’s what happened last year. The weather has been dry this year…barely any winds and most of the week we’ve seen South-Easterly winds. They just cause dust and minor pollutants to rebound back over Delhi,” said Skymet chief meteorologist Mahesh Palawat.E-mails and calls to Gufran Beig, who leads SAFAR’s operations in Pune, weren’t returned.On Friday, The Hindu reported that there was no significant fall in the National Air Quality Index — a scale that combines the relative proportion of a range of pollutants with the health hazard posed by each of them and rates the air everyday from ‘good’ to ‘hazardous’ — with a steady decline in quality from December 25 and no notable improvement over the period.When confronted with a query regarding relatively low pollution levels in comparison to those registered since the advent of his government’s odd-even vehicle rationing scheme, Transport Minister Gopal Rai said these were a direct consequence of climatic factors such as rainfall and wind velocity.“It is unfair to compare only pollution levels without factoring in weather conditions. For instance, there was much rainfall this time last year, which can be credited with cleansing the Capital’s air of suspended particulate matter. This time, however, there was none,” Mr. Rai told The Hindu .In further defence of the policy, the Minister quoted a dip in pollution levels at interior locations in Delhi, namely, the border areas where “diesel vehicles were operating sans the regulations underlining the scheme”.Delhi Dialogue Commission Vice-Chairperson Ashish Khetan said: “We cannot tell the weather gods to turn on the wind and turn off the fog, to turn on the rains and turn off the Western Disturbances. As a government, we can cut down on sources of pollutants, incentivise good environmental practices and penalise polluters. And this is exactly what we are doing.”“Vehicular traffic is a major and consistent source of pollution. While one may quibble about percentages, there is unanimity that cars do not emit oxygen; they emit hazardous pollutants. The way forward is more efficient and augmented public transport so there is less dependence on private transport,” Mr. Khetan said in reply to a questionnaire mailed by The Hindu .“At the same time, our government is also acting against other sources of pollution which includes thermal power plants in the vicinity of Delhi, construction sites and industries not observing the standards, mechanised cleaning of roads, intensifying urban forestry, etc”
