In a major step towards digitization, the Indian Railways on Monday launched a web-based system to monitor track maintenance on a real-time basis by replacing more than a lakh registers related to it.The web-based management of track maintenance will be implemented in all the 68 divisions of the Indian Railways. Various activities such as track inspection, monitoring and maintenance will now be done on the e-platform.Union Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu termed the system as “cost and time saving” adding that “it has saved about Rs 1,100 crore in a zone. There was cost overrun due to delay in project implementation. The new system in engineering section will prevent that and more departments will follow the suit now.”The system will give alerts through SMS and e-mails to the concerned officials in the Railways. “This system is designed for decentralized data capturing, speedy information dissemination along with centralized data keeping and analysis,” said a Ministry of Railways statement.Management of track maintenance, done largely manually at present, involves handling of huge volumes of data statistics as well as analysis of various measurement and defects and planning, deployment of large resources.
