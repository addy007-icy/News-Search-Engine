Veteran Edakka and Chenda exponent Prakasan Pazhambalacode can be rightfully called a champion of the traditional percussion instruments.His efforts in preserving the legacy of his father, Panchavadyam-Thayambaka maestro Pallavoor Appu Marar, and in popularising the percussion instruments have begun to achieve results with many people, particularly youngsters, opting to learn them in recent years.“The times have changed since when training in percussion instruments was considered by certain sections as a lowly activity. There is tremendous interest among people hailing from various backgrounds in learning to play the Chenda,” says the 50-year-old artiste, on the sidelines of the Chenda Thayambaka competition that was held for high school students on Monday.Prakasan is a staunch advocate of spreading the reach of traditional instruments, beyond social boundaries. “I do not subscribe to the concept of restricting art forms such as Chendamelam to people belonging to a certain community or religion. At the same time, I’m of the view that a particular culture, lifestyle and dress code must be observed by the performers,” he says.The artiste was recently in the news for his vociferous opposition against a proposal to ban cow slaughter as it would prevent the use of cow hide in the making of drums. “Any move that affected the manufacture of percussion instruments such as Chenda, Mridangam and Edakka will render close to five lakh people jobless.”Transcending the conventional technique of training, Prakasan’s online classes for teaching Chenda and Edakka has elicited interest among people from far-off places.
