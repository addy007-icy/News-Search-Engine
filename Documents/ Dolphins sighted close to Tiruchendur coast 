In a rare spectacle, people along the shores of Kallmozhi in the district saw several adult dolphins move close to shore on Monday evening.“About twenty to thirty dolphins were sighted three km from Alanthalai. Each dolphin would weigh about a tonne and seemed to be 10 to 15 feet long,” Joint Director of Fisheries, R. Amal Xavier told The Hindu .As dolphins are marine mammals, the Forest Department officials were alerted. Normally, such sea mammals move across in search of sardines to feed upon. Dolphin is a endangered marine species under the Wildlife Act and hence should be protected. The local fishermen were asked to cooperate with the Forest Department officials to ensure that all dolphins are moved into the deep sea. “The task to drive them away into the deep sea is under way,” Mr. Xavier said.
