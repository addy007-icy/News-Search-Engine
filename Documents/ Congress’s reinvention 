The Congress, given its long history, deserves to be in the national reckoning (“ >Allying with the adversary”, Jan.27). While the crushing defeat in the general election has been demoralising for both the party leadership and cadre, there is no reason for them to be despondent given the far below average performance of the NDA government in the last 20 months. A combined opposition in Bihar literally demolished the theory of development and good governance that was being bandied about by the BJP.However, parties like the JD-U should rally behind the Congress party if they want to project a united opposition to the NDA at the national level. On its part, the Congress should shed its ambivalence and scout for alliance partners wherever possible. The aggressive push for strategic alliance partners was the major factor that catapulted the Congress to power from 2004 to 2014.J. Anantha Padmanabhan,Tiruchi
