A few hours before her wedding was to take place on Monday, a 14-year-old girl of Tellagundlapalle village in Palamaner mandal, 45 km from here, contacted representatives of an NGO, who swung into action and stopped the illegal event from happening.The girl, an orphan from the ST community and studying in Class IX, was betrothed to Ramesh (20), a daily wager from the nearby Kadirimadugu village.Despite stiff resistance from her uncle and the boy’s relatives, the girl mustered courage and gave the slip to the revelling members in the early hours, went to a public telephone located some distance away, contacted the Child Helpline number of the Rural Organisation of Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES), and told them about the event to happen.ROPES director P. Sri Latha, in coordination with the local police, rushed to the village and stopped the marriage from happening despite resistance from relatives of both the parties.In the presence of the rescue team, the girl urged the boy to make a promise that he would wait for another four years to take her hand.The boy, while stating that he was not in a hurry to marry a child, said he was forced to accept the marriage. He also said that he would wait for any number of years for the girl, and even financially assist her in pursuing her studies. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Sri Latha said that ROPES volunteers, in the last couple of weeks, toured remote villages and distributed pamphlets against child marriage. The pamphlets also contained the Child Helpline number.“The pamphlet has helped the girl contact us in the nick of the moment,” she said.
