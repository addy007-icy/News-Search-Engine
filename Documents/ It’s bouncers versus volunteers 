Volunteers of the 103rd Indian Science Congress staged a protest in front of the food court set up at the Manasagangothri campus against the alleged high-handedness of bouncers deployed by a private agency.The volunteers, roped in by the University of Mysore to assist the delegates of the congress, demanded the eviction of the bouncers from the campus after a volunteer, a postgraduate student of the university, was allegedly manhandled by bouncers when was entering the food court in the afternoon.The protesters demanded that the university authorities punish the bouncers responsible for the alleged assault on the volunteer before clearing bouncers from the campus.Meanwhile, police reached the spot and tried to pacify the agitating volunteers, who refused to budge.Meanwhile, Rajesh Kumar, a student of the university, who was protesting on behalf of the volunteers, told The Hindu that bouncers were not only misbehaving with the delegates, but also the girl students in the campus.Reacting to Prof Rangappaâ€™s statement that the university needed bouncers to control the crowd at the food court, Mr. Rajesh said that the university should consider posting police personnel or NCC cadets instead of bouncers.The organisers had deployed more than 50 bouncers from different private agencies to ensure discipline and to control the crowd at the food court during the Indian Science Congress.
