The body of a mystery man — mistaken to be that of a 54-year old Indian-origin hotelier allegedly murdered during a visit to India in May last year — has been flown to the U.K..Indian authorities had sent the body — which was on Tuesday handed over to the U.K. social services — in the belief that it was that of Ranjit Singh Power, allegedly murdered during a visit to Punjab 10 months ago.Officials thought the corpse, one of the five pulled from a river in Punjab, was that of the missing hotelier but dental records and DNA testing proved the body was not his.The body cannot be repatriated India. A funeral will be conducted by social services though the DNA will be retained for further inquiries.A post-mortem examination estimated that the dead man’s age was more than 50, though it was unable to ascertain the cause of death.
