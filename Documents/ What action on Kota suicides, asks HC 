After the district and State-level authorities, it is now the Rajasthan High Court which has taken up the issue of increasing student suicides at Kota — the coaching hub for engineering and medical entrance examinations.Taking cognisance of the increasing suicides, the High Court on Monday issued a notice to the State and district-level authorities, including the Rajasthan Chief Secretary, and the Kota Collector and the Superintendent of Police, seeking a reply on the increasing number of suicides and the action being taken to prevent them.The issue of suicides by engineering and medical aspirants came to the notice of the authorities last year after the number of deaths reached 18 — the highest in the past five years. The number was a major increase compared with the suicides witnessed in 2013 when 13 students killed themselves. In 2014, eight students committed suicide.In November last year, Kota Collector Ravikumar Surpur issued directions to all coaching institutions which included ‘mandatory one-day break in a week’, psychiatric consultations to de-stress the students, and compulsory career counselling to each student along with parents prior to admission.Dr. Surpur told The Hindu, “We have directed the institutions to take necessary action in the interest of students. A follow-up meeting was also held by the Rajasthan Chief Secretary [C.S. Rajan] after the instructions were issued.”To cater to students, Hope Helpline would start functioning within a week, Dr. Surpur said.
