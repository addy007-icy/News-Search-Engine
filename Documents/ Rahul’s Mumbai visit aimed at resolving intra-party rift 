Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s schedule for his two-day Mumbai trip —starting from Friday — is mostly packed with meetings with party workers. The reason: the ongoing intra-party rift in the city unit is affecting the daily functioning of the party.Congress sources said Mr. Gandhi “squeezed” meetings with other people and decided to devote the entire Friday to meet the two estranged factions —one led by Gurudas Kamat and other by the State unit president Sanjay Nirupam, who came under the scanner of the party’s disciplinary committee after an article heavily critical of the Gandhi family appeared in its state mouthpiece “Mumbai Sandesh” last December.“Rahulji will meet both sides,” said a senior Congress leader. “This infighting has become toxic now. We will certainly take tough measure to stop it, even if we have to make tough changes.”On Friday, Mr. Gandhi will address the party workers at 2 p.m. at Father Justin Ground in Malad. At 3.30 p.m. he will head to the Mumbai Congress office at Azad Maidan. There, he will inaugurate a meeting hall that has been built in the memory of Murlibhai Deora, former Congress leader, who passed away in November 2014. Soon after, Mr. Gandhi will have “one-to-one” meetings with Mr. Nirupam and Mr. Kamat.On Saturday, Mr. Gandhi will hit the Mumbai streets to mark his protest against the “increasing” electricity tariffs and suspension of Street Vendors Act, a policy that was implemented by the UPA-II government.
