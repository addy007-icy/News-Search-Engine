The price of flowers which ruled the roost during the Christmas, New Year Day, and Meeladunnabi festivals has registered a downward trend since then. The price of ‘malli’ has come down from Rs. 1,200 a kg to Rs. 500; ‘samanthipoo’ from Rs. 120 to Rs. 60; ‘kakattan’ from Rs. 300 to Rs. 70; ‘rose’ from Rs. 200 to Rs. 120, at the VOC Flower Market in the city. The flowers are expected to be in good demand during the Pongal festival days too, and as such the traders expect the price of all varieties of flowers to skyrocket then. “The traders of VOC Flower Market have already taken the initiative to meet the demand for flowers during Pongal,” said K. Palanisamy, a trader of long standing at the market.
