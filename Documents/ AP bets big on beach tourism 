Mr. Naidu said that Visakhapatnam had sun-kissed beaches and green-capped hillocks, and the people of the city, the largest in Navya Andhra Pradesh, were also very hospitable with a robust industrial base and two ports.He said that the city could be transformed into a heaven for beach tourism. Inland waterways was another area that had plenty of opportunities for investment, he said. Union Minister for Civil Aviation P.

Lauding Mr. Naidu for his proactive approach, Chairman of Zee and ESSEL Group Subhash Chandra said tourism was a huge revenue-earner and job creator, and the Chief Minister had the vision to explore the vast scope by inviting private investors. He said, to give a push to the sector, there should be a re-look at high dose of taxation. Leela Venture Limited CMD Vivek Nair said beach tourism should be given a fillip by relaxing CRZ restrictions.As luxury tourism would entail huge investments, the State should first concentrate on promoting other forms of tourism.
