Despite a windy day and fewer cars on the roads, the daily average of particulate matter (PM) in the Capital increased on Wednesday in comparison to the previous few days.Though air quality improved during the day, it was back up to highly toxic levels by the evening.Levels of PM in the air have been very high over the past few days, putting pollution in “severe” and “very poor” categories in almost all parts of Delhi. But the PM levels began dipping on Wednesday morning as the wind picked up.A Meteorological Department official said the wind speed went from 7 km/h at 11.30 a.m. to 11 km/h at 2.30 p.m., before falling down to almost nil in the evening.Due to the wind, the dip in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the morning to the evening was quite evident. For instance, the Anand Vihar monitoring station saw the PM2.5 level fall from 580 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 a.m. to 155 at 4 p.m, but the daily average was eight times the standard of 60. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the average PM2.5 level at Anand Vihar on Wednesday was 481.95 micrograms per cubic metre, up from Tuesday’s 433.43.According to experts, the potential impact of the ongoing odd-even experiment cannot be isolated from weather conditions and the pollution levels in neighbouring States.“From Wednesday's data, we can say that even if we have wind and reduce sources of pollution, like decreasing the number of cars, we cannot clean up the air quality,” said Sunil Dahiya, a campaigner with Greenpeace.He added that without a systematic regional and national action plan, the Delhi Government's efforts to reduce pollution would not have much impact.Anumita Roychodhury, the head of the Centre for Science and Environment's clean air campaign, added that the “weather will keep pulling the air quality down”, so there was a need for tackling all the sources of pollution.Meanwhile, Thursday's forecast of light rain and possible thundershowers may help clear up pollution.
