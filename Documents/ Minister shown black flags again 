There seems to be no end to public embarrassment to Odisha Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Naik.Now facing egg attacks wherever he goes, Mr. Naik was also shown black flags here on Friday when he visited the Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre.An alert city police took three youths under preventive custody the moment they pulled out the flags to wave at the Minister as he alighted from his car inside the portico of the cancer hospital. A handful of others gathered at the spot shouted slogans asking the Minister to go back. “All the three youths — Niranjan Das, Debashis Mohapatra and K. Baburam were released under PR bonds soon after the Minister left the city,” said the Mangalabag police inspector A. K. Swain adding that the youths have admitted having allegiance to the Congress.
