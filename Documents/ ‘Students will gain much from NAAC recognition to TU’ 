Telangana University Registrar R. Limbadri said with the varsity getting the NAAC certification, the value of its degrees would increase and students could gain much in job interviews and appointments.“The university would grow by leaps and bounds after securing the NAAC certification with good scoring. We all made combined efforts under the able guidance of Vice-Chancellor C. Parthasarathy to get good grades for the golden future of the students,” he said, while addressing a press conference at his chambers on Thursday.It’s yet another feather in its cap as even before the completion of 10 years of its establishment, the TU achieved the prestigious NAAC recognition, he said and added that in the job market, students of those educational institutions which had this recognition would be given importance. The university administration would always work with the intention of improving the welfare of its students.With the support of MP K. Kavitha, the TU entered into an MoU with Chicago State University and could acquire 24 hour Wi-Fi facility, electricity and pure drinking water, he said.
