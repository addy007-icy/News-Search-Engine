In stark contrast with previous years, farmers in most of the areas of Telangana are facing a different situation this agriculture year wherein they have ample power to run their pump-sets but have no water in their tube and open wells, thanks to continued negligence over tapping the rainwater in spite of the ongoing watershed programme in place. In spite of the fact that more than half of the State is reeling under severe drought conditions due to unevenly spread rainfall during the southwest monsoon, the rainfall recorded is not very low technically as the actual rainfall was 607 mm rain against the normal of 714 mm during the period. However, the impact of drought conditions is higher compared to the rainfall deficit due to continued negligence or lack of awareness on tapping rainwater in percolation areas rather than discharge areas.“It’s an undeniable fact that a sizeable amount of over 1,610 tmcft water that has flown waste into the sea from Dowleswaram barrage in Andhra Pradesh this water year is contributed by rainfall in the large catchment area of Godavari river in Telangana,” a senior official involved in the implementation of integrated watershed management programme admitted.The official, however, stated that there would not have been groundwater problem in over half of about 17-lakh open and tube wells having energised pump-sets facing serious water shortage had the implementation of rainwater harvesting for percolation purpose been proper. As a result, cultivation in the ongoing rabi is hard to touch even half of the total extent of 12.53 lakh hectares for the season, as it has been less than two-thirds of the normal of about 6.7 lakh hectares so far.In addition to the revival of irrigation tanks taken up by the State Government adoption of useful water conservation methods would have avoided the present situation to a large extent. “Formation of micro percolation tanks in nearly half-acre area by every farmer having a minimum landholding of two-three acres with a cost of Rs.30,000 would transform the prospects of agriculture considerably high”, former Engineer-in-Chief of AP T. Hanumantha Rao suggested . Even the half-acre area would not remain unutilised as some short-term crops could be cultivated there with the help of soil moisture, once the rainy season was over and percolation area goes dry, he stated.The results achieved from watershed programme in the two Telugu States from mid-1990s go pale before the amount of about Rs.1,200 crore spent on it. “However, results are visible wherever the concept was understood and owned-up by farmers”, Mr. Hanumantha Rao, who is also a UN consultant on water issues, said.
