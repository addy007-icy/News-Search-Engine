In an attempt to make governance more accessible to the public, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Tuesday launched ‘Amma Call Centre’, which would function round the clock to receive calls from citizens.The call centre, which would receive calls made through the toll-free number 1100, would be manned by 138 persons in the initial phase to receive at least 15,000 calls per day. “Based on the need, more persons would be added to the call centre”, an official release said.The details of the grievances from callers would be sent to officials concerned through e-mail, phone call and text messages. The caller too would be informed about the officer, who has been informed of the complaint and further the action taken on it.
