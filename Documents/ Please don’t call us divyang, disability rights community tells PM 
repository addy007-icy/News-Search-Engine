“Please don’t call us divyang,” is what several disabled people’s organisations have appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a written appeal to the PM, the group has said that during his radio address “Mann Ki Baat” on December 27 last year he had said that physically-challenged people have a “divine ability” and the term ‘divyang’ should be used in place of ‘viklang’ for them.“Please refrain from trying to replace the ‘viklaang’,” the appeal reads.Maintaining that “invoking divinity will not lessen the stigma and discrimination that persons with disabilities have been historically subjected to and continue to encounter in their daily lives,” the group has said: “We would like to reiterate that disability is not a divine gift. And the use of phrases like ‘divyang’ in no way ensures de-stigmatisation or an end to discrimination on grounds of disability.”Disability rights organisations said that the government should address the issues of stigma, discrimination and marginalisation that persons with disabilities are subjected to. .
