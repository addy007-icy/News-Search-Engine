Tamil film director and Naam Tamilar Katchi leader Seeman, along with over 100 of his party workers, was on Tuesday taken into preventive custody when they attempted to proceed to a nearby village for organising jallikattu defying the ban on the bull-taming sport.Seeman had recently announced that jalliakattu would be conducted by his party in Palamedu on Tuesday despite the ban on it by the Supreme Court.When Seeman along with around 110 party workers were on their way to Palamedu to conduct jallikattu, police intercepted them and took them into preventive custody at Sikandarchavadi, police said.Madurai and surrounding areas have been witnessing protests against the ban on jallikattu, held during the Pongal festival in mid-January.The Centre had recently issued a notification allowing the sport, but the apex court, hearing a batch of petitions from animal rights groups and others, stayed it last week.
