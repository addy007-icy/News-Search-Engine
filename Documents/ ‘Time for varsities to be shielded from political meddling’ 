Universities should impart vibrant knowledge and promote research, Goverdhan Mehta, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hyderabad and former Director of Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said on Saturday.In his address at the first convocation of Rayalaseema University here, Prof. Mehta said universities should safeguard individual autonomy, besides being shielded from political meddling.India ranked high in the Forbes list of billionaires but ranked 130th in the human development index according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Prof. Mehta said. “India is the largest English speaking nation but, at the same time, it is one with rampant illiteracy. As many as 970 million cell phones and 200 million smart phones are being used in India, but a fraction of people have access to clean drinking water and basic amenities,” he lamented. It is high time governments pondered over the prevalence of poverty, unemployment, corruption and violence, as personal and sectarian interests came before national interests.
