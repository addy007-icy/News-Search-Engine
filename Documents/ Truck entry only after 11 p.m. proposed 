Delhi government has proposed to allow the entry of trucks into the national Capital from 11 p.m. as against the existing 9 p.m. in an effort to bring down pollution level.As per rough estimates, around 50,000 trucks enter Delhi every day contributing to the pollution levels in the city.“Transport department has sent a proposal which favours allowing of trucks in Delhi only from 11 p.m. instead of existing 9 p.m.,” said a senior government official.The official said that the proposal has been sent to the government which will sent it to Lt Governor Najeeb Jung for his approval.The proposal pertaining to trucks has been prepared as part of bringing down pollution level in the capital, the official said.Another official said that the move to extend two hours of no entry for trucks will help in reducing pollution.Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai had recently met Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari to expedite the construction works of the eastern peripheral highway and the Western Peripheral Expressway so that trucks cannot use Delhi roads.Delhi government’s ambitious odd-even scheme, a first such initiative in the country to combat spiralling air pollution, got off to a decent start on new year Friday.— PTI
