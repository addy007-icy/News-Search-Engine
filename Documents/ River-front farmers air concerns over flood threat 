Farmers in river-front villages continue to confront the CRDA personnel over the draft of detailed master plan for the new capital city of Amaravati. With the details of the master plan replete with allotment of residential, commercial and business zones out in the public domain, the landowners are getting apprehensive about their future.“Why are the farmers, who willingly had parted with their land under the Land Pooling System, kept out of the CRDA master plan? Are there any representatives of farmers in the CRDA? These are the questions that have occupied the farmers. “Did the CRDA earmark places for affordable housing for the poor?,” Mallella Harindranath Chowdary, a local leader from Rayapudi.Villagers also demanded that the CRDA should first address the issues of recognising the extended village boundaries. Some of them also questioned the rationale behind printing the master plan in English, a language which a very few farmers can understand.The issue of flooding of Kondaveeti drain and the construction of a balancing reservoir also cropped up during the awareness meeting. Local leaders such as M. Seshagiri Rao questioned the possible flooding threat to Rayapudi village, in case the new capital city was constructed on an elevated plane.Awareness meet cancelledThe CRDA officials were also confronted with stoic resistance from the villagers of Neerukonda and Kuragallu in Mangalagiri mandal and were forced to cancel the awareness meetings held on the draft detailed master plan.The villagers confronted the CRDA personnel on the issues of extended village boundaries, allotment of reconstituted developed plots and demanded that the officials should address these issues before holding any meetings.
