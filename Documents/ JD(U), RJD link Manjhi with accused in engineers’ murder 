Under opposition fire for a series of murders in the State, ruling JD(U) and RJD have sought to turn the tables by linking HAM(S), led by former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, with the couple arrested on the charge of murdering two engineers in Darbhanga.Baheri block head Munni Devi and her husband Sanjay Laldeo, were arrested from outside Laheriasarai railway station on Saturday in connection with the December 26 killing of two engineers.On posters with ManjhiThey had featured prominently on the posters of Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), an ally of the BJP, along with him, JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar told reporters.He claimed that Munni Devi, who is sister of jailed gangster Santosh Jha, had even tried for HAM(S) ticket in the recent Assembly elections.Political patronageNeeraj Kumar, an MLC, urged State police chief P K Thakur to probe this “linkage and political patronage” provided to criminals to tarnish image of the Nitish Kumar ministry.RJD spokesman Mundrika Singh Yadav said the appearance of the lady and her husband in HAM(S) posters with Mr Manjhi has revealed the “hidden face of people encouraging criminals.”“Plans are being hatched systematically to tarnish the image of the secular government in the State,” he said.Manjhi denies chargesMeanwhile, Mr Manjhi defended himself saying it is not possible for him to know the background of everyone coming to a political meeting.In a statement, he said several people come to political meetings and honour leaders on the dais. “How does one know about the personal life and background of someone in such a situation?” he asked.He denied JD(U)’s allegation of sitting on dharna at Darbhanga in the past with the accused woman and her husband. “I staged no dharna in Darbhanga. So the question of Munni Devi participating in the dharna does not arise,” -- PTI
