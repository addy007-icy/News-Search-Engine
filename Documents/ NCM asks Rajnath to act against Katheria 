The National Commission for Minorities has asked Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and U.P. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to act against Union Minister Ram Shankar Katheria for his alleged inflammatory remarks against Muslims.At a condolence meeting on Sunday for murdered Dalit VHP activist Arun Mahaur in Agra, VHP and BJP leaders allegedly urged Hindus to prepare for a final battle in 2017. “What is more disturbing is that responsible people from the government are reported to have made some of the vitriolic statements,” NCM chairperson Naseem Ahmad wroteto Mr. Singh and Mr. Yadav.The NCM has also issued notice to the Election Commission of India, urging Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi to check “such irresponsible and communally charged utterances.”The notice was issued on the complaint by social activist and Congress supporter Shehzad Poonawalla. “It is high time hate mongers are booked as demanded by me in a petition under 153a and 153b and 295a of IPC. Authorities cannot drag their feet. The ECI must act against the BJP for being a habitual offender,” Mr. Poonawalla said.A day after BSP chief Mayawati accused the BJP of whipping up “communal frenzy” and demanded the sacking of Mr. Katheria, parties continued to spar. Samajwadi Party Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav accused the BJP-RSS of trying to incite riots.
