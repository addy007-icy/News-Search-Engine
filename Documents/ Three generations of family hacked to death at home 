Mare Gowda’s property was popularly known as ‘Onti Mane’.Investigations revealed that the assailants gained entry into the house without any force and hacked the trio to death. While Gowramma and Sukanya’s bodies were found inside, that of Mare Gowda was found 150 metres away from the house.The crime might have taken place late at night.
