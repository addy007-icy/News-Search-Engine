Noor Mohammad, Janata Dal (United) leader who had challenged the denial of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) to Raichur in Supreme Court, alleged that the State government had furnished wrong information to the Central Site Selection Committee that visited Mysuru, Dharwad and Raichur.Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, he said that the State government showed Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) land which cannot be given for constructing IIT campus.“I have obtained information under Right To Information Act. KIADB office has clearly said that the land would be allotted only for industrial purposes.They clarified that there were no changes in the rules so as to facilitate KIADB land allocation to IIT. In another RTI reply, Under Secretary of Department of Industries and Commerce, has clarified that KIADB has not allocated any land for the construction of IIT campus in Dharwad. Yet State government has showed KIADB lands to site selection committee for the campus knowing that allocation of KIADB lands to IIT campus was impermissible,” he said.
