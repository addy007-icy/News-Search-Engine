The Supreme Court ban on cockfights did not have any impact on what people in Andhra Pradesh, particularly those in Krishna and the two Godavari districts, considered a tradition rather than a violent sport.Huge sums changed hands as betting took place on an unprecedented scale across the State while the police either kept themselves away or quietly watched richly–nourished birds fight the battles of their lives, some till death, at makeshift stadiums.Hundreds of people were bound over but there was no stopping of the game at most other places. People’s representatives participated as chief guests and inaugurated cockfights at many places in apparent violation of the apex court orders.Villages around Vijayawada city and in other parts of Krishna and Guntur districts witnessed a festive atmosphere as cockfights took the centre-stage of Sankranti celebrations. Warnings by the city police failed to deter people from betting big on the birds.Representatives of all parties encouraged the cockfights by inaugurating and watching them under media glare. Cockfights took place across West Godavari district. Thousands of people from different parts of the district reached the villages along with well-trained cocks and wads of currency notes. They maintained that the cockfights were a part of Telugu culture and no one could separate it from the lifestyle of the people.The stakes ranged from thousands to lakhs of rupees depending on quality of the birds. The total stake runs in to crores of rupees.The people’s representatives maintained that: “it is a part of our culture but not a crime”.
