A writ petition moved in the Delhi High Court on Friday sought action against bureaucrats who went on mass leave to protest against the suspension of two DANICS cadre officers by the Aam Aadmi Party government last month.A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, agreed to hear the petition on January 27 along with a bunch of other petitions relating to the ongoing tussle between the Centre and Delhi government.About 200 DANICS officers reportedly went on mass leave on December 31 after two senior civil service officers of Delhi government's Home Department were suspended for allegedly refusing to sign on a Cabinet decision file. Some IAS officers also went on half-day leave in solidarity with the agitators.The Union Home Ministry had termed the suspension of officers as null and void.Petitioner Indu Prakash Singh contended that the public servants had no legal right to go on strike.The officers had violated the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules, he said, while seeking directions for ensuring that such acts were not repeated in future.In its order on another writ petition, the court refused to entertain the plea for setting aside of suspension of the two officers, while observing that no public interest was involved in the matter.200 DANICS officers reportedly went on mass leave on Dec. 31 after two officers were suspended
