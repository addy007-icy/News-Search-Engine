Rafi Bhandari, former Syndicate member of Karnataka State Women’s University, has urged the Union Human Resource Ministry and the Vice-Chancellor of Moulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad, to open a satellite centre of the university in Vijayapura.In a memorandum submitted to the Ministry as well as the university, a copy of which was forwarded to the district administration, he said that a majority of people in north Karnataka speak Urdu. “This region has around 400 Urdu primary schools, around 50 high schools and some 30 junior/first grade colleges. However, owing to the presence of increasing number of English medium schools and closure of Urdu schools, the number of dropouts is increasing,” he said.Mr. Bhandari said that the number of people pursuing higher education among Muslims was also declining, which was a cause of concern.He said that opening a satellite centre would help Urdu students, mainly Muslims, choose vocational and job-oriented courses for finding a suitable job.“Apart from this, it is possible that people of other communities may show interest in Urdu,” he said.Claiming that Vijayapura was a suitable place for setting up the centre, Mr. Bhandari urged the district administration to send a proposal to the Ministry and the university.‘It will help Urdu students choose vocational and job-oriented courses’
