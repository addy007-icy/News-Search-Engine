People’s Watch, a human rights defender of Madurai, has appealed to the State government to immediately suspend all authorities who had been approached by students of SVS College of Yoga, Naturopathy and Homoeopathy, Bangaram, on issues concerning them.In a statement issued here, its Executive Director Henri Tiphagne termed the death of three students as “murder” caused by “wilful criminal negligence” of several officials of the government and justice institutions. The post-mortem of bodies should be performed by a team of doctors from outside Villupuram district and videographed. “The bodies should only be buried and not cremated,” it said.People’s Watch wanted the Chairperson of the State Human Rights Commission to immediately intervene in the matter and ensure that all students of the college were transferred to other government colleges at State cost. The government should ensure that all vacancies in colleges were filled up immediately, “giving no more reasons for harassment and the subsequent murder/suicide of young students from vulnerable communities.” Officials of higher education should ensure that there was no discrimination, victimisation, unfavourable treatment and harassment in institutions of higher learning.
