The alleged police assault on the artists of Kalakakshi collective on New Year’s night has set off a string of protests against police highhandedness and ‘moral policing’.With the Biennale Supporters’ Forum and the People Against Fascism campaigners joining forces with Kalakakshi, an artistic demonstration denouncing all forms of self-righteous enforcement of public morality will be held at Vanchi Square on January 8.Performance by artistsAbout 50 artists will turn up at the venue dressed in Kalakakshi’s blue overalls with ‘Art Worker’ inscribed on the back and a red safety helmet — the attire the hospitalised art students were wearing when they were attacked by the police — in a unique statement of solidarity.“There will be performances by art students. Women artists incarcerated in iron cages will cut open the bars to come out in a symbolic demonstration of the right to move freely without fear,” Jasinther Rockfeller, a sculptor part of the group, said .Purushan Eloor, one of the organisers of the People Against Fascism meet, has urged everyone part of the event to spare the evening on January 8 for a cultural demonstration at 4.30 p.m. to be taken out to the office of the City Police Commissioner.Signature campaignIn the run-up to this, artists will take out a signature campaign at Fort Kochi and Ernakulam mainland on January 5 for a memorandum to be submitted to the State Human Rights Commission, seeking action against violation of the right to free movement in public spaces.On Monday, they drew inspiration from the Kochi Biennale Foundation’s ‘Arts and Medicine’ programme to carry out spontaneous portraiture of the inmates of Fort Kochi Hospital where the injured art students are recuperating.“Some 15 artists took part in this unique gesture of bonding and bonhomie,” said an artist.The police have so far recorded the statement of Manu C.A, one of the students admitted to the hospital, while the rest have been asked to give their statement at the police station.
