Nathu Singh’s three-wicket burst early on and captain Unmukt Chand’s responsible knock of 77 not out guided India-B to a comprehensive five-wicket win over India-A in the opening match of the Deodhar Trophy at the Green Park here on Monday.Electing to field in cold morning conditions, India-B banked on its new ball bowlers’ good work to restrict India-A to 161, and then recovered from a minor collapse to romp home with more than 20 overs to spare.Dhawal Kulkarni and the highly rated Nathu Singh from Rajasthan made the most of the opportunity to give their team an early advantage.Nathu stuck to bowling line and length and delivered a double blow in his second over. His sharp incoming deliveries had Jalaj Saxena and Mandeep Singh bowled spectacularly within the space of three deliveries.Three overs later, Kulkarni made a quiet M. Vijay — he faced 22 deliveries but made a duck — play a square cut and enjoyed watching Pawan Negi completing a diving catch after Sheldon Jackson had failed to latch on to it.Nathu then castled Kedar Jadhav, and Kulkarni, after changing ends, had Naman Ojha caught in the slips to reduce India-A to 29 for five by the 14th over. However, captain Ambati Rayudu (58) and Parvez Rasool (66) applied themselves to forge a 104-run stand for the sixth wicket. Rayudu, who played patiently and picked up boundaries predominantly on the onside, and Rasool rotated the strike well and batted more freely when conditions improved.Rasool, who got a reprieve on 14 off Karn Sharma, struck six well-timed fours and a handsome six over extra-cover off Pawan Negi. In fact, the duo picked on Negi to play some big shots off and maintain a decent run rate. However, it was Negi who broke the partnership by having Rayudu stumped. Rasool fell to Stuart Binny before the India-A innings folded in the 45th over.Negi eventually returned three wickets for 50.Chand led the India-B chase in style by cutting, pulling and driving the India-A pacers for some attractive boundaries.Amit Mishra applied the brakes on India-B by employing his variations and claiming three quick wickets.After Shreyas Iyer (24) hit Mishra for a four and a six off consecutive balls, the leg-spinner retaliated by trapping the Mumbai batsmen in front.B. Aparajith departed off the very next delivery, and Jackson was adjudged lbw in Mishra’s following over.India-B was 78 for four after losing Suryakumar Yadav, but a determined Chand and an experienced Dinesh Karthik (34), who entertained with some clean hits, batted sensibly to add 81 and take their team closer to victory.The scores: India-A: M.
