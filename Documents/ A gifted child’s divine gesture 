He used to listen to the hymns played through mobile phones and would instantly pick them and recite at the temples in Puducherry and also in neighbouring Tamil Nadu”.His mother Sangeetha said, “I used to visit the temple since I conceived the child. After birth of child, I used to take him for evening prayers at the temple where all these Thevaram, Thiruvasakam were sung. We never compelled him to learn all these hymns.”Token of loveThe boy has been singing the hymns at various temples since 2014. Impressed by his talents, the devotees and philanthropists offered him money as token of love and affection for him. He gave the entire cash to the temple authorities in the presence of his parents.Mr. Anand added: “Well-wishers advised us to utilise the money for good cause and so we donated the money for the renovation works of temple.”The young boy has bagged awards for his recitation at competitions conducted by spiritual organisations.
