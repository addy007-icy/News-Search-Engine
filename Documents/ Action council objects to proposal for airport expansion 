The Airport People’s Action Council has said attempts are being made by land mafia and private entities to serve their vested interests by getting the airport expanded.In the name of development, these “forces’ are trying to push authorities to acquire more land by displacing large number of marginally deprived sections of the society for airport expansion.The council, in a press release issued here, said the vested interest groups were now mooting a proposal for expanding the runway to All Saints’ College area and closure of All Saints’-Shanghumughom road.Government standAt a time when two terminals constructed at a huge cost are readily available, these groups wanted construction of terminals in the heart of the city for their personal benefit, the press release said.The government had agreed to retain the domestic service from Shanghumughom and avoid land acquisition at Vayyamoola-Vallakadavu area. In case of land needed for runway expansion, the government had agreed to acquire land at Muttathara and construction of a subway for locals to commute, the release said.‘Flimsy grounds’Citing flimsy grounds, services from the domestic terminal are being shifted.Attempts were being made to make the runway at Shanghumughom defunct and acquire land at Vayyamoola-Vallakadavu area, the release said.
