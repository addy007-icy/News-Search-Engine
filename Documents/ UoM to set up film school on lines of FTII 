The University of Mysore (UoM) is set to establish a film and television school to offer certificates, diplomas and master’s degree in film making on the lines of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII).The university signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this connection with the Franco-Indian Film Society to promote International School for Cinema and Television.This was disclosed by Prof. K.S. Rangappa, Vice-chancellor, UoM, during the inauguration of the two-day Global Communication Association’s 11{+t}{+h}India conference here on Thursday.Later speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the conference, the V-C said that the Board of Studies will design and finalise the course curriculum in association with the Franco-Indian Film Society.“In all probability, admissions for the course may commence from the 2016-17 academic year. The initiative is perhaps the first of its kind by any university in the country … It will help creative students, who are keen to enter film and documentary making, but lack avenues to hone their interest,” Prof. Rangappa said.The courses offered by the proposed institution will be similar to those offered by FTII and similar international schools to match global standards, he said and added that the move is to create a world class film school that will offer specialised training and courses in the art of film making.The MoU was signed on Wednesday.The curriculum concept envisages a one-year certificate course in film making and two-year diplomas in scriptwriting, screen play and sound, producing, directing, cinematography, art direction, production design and editing.The master’s degree is envisaged to be a three-year course in art direction, cinematography, directing, editing, television, producing, scriptwriting and sound.The proposal states that the concept envisages educating the students to become film makers first by making a number of short projects, before specialising in different professional disciplines.Before launching the course, there are plans to research the existing curricula, besides consulting with the industry professionals in the U.S. and Europe.There will also be meetings with film schools in France, Denmark, Belgium, the U.S. and England and entering into a MoU with each of the schools.
