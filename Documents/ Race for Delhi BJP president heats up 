With Amit Shah’s re-election as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s president on Sunday, the stage is now set for a new leadership to take charge of the Delhi unit of the party.The primary objective of the party, which faced massive debacle in the 2015 Delhi Assembly polls, will now be to constitute a strong State team to salvage its image and promptly strategise for the municipal corporation polls scheduled to be held next year.Sources said once Mr. Shah picks up his own team for the party’s national leadership, next in line will be the Delhi unit for which the workers shall be asked to focus on “good governance”. The BJP has been in power in the three civic bodies for seven years now and the party is likely to form such a leadership in the Capital which would scuttle the anti-incumbency factor.Having faced severe criticism for the Assembly polls defeat, the chances of acting Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay being re-elected for a second term appear slim.One of the names doing the rounds for the key post is MP Parvesh Varma, son of former Delhi Chief Minister Saheb Singh Varma, who is the party’s Jat face in city politics. Another name being discussed at the Delhi BJP office is that of Srikant Sharma, who is currently the BJP’s national secretary.Names of some women leaders too are being discussed for the position. These include New Delhi MP Meenakashi Lekhi, former Delhi mayor Dr Rajni Abbi, state party vice-president Shikha Rai and general secretary Rekha Gupta, a party insider said.The State unit elections are likely to be over by early February.
