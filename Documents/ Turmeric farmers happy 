Smiles are back on the faces of turmeric cultivators in the district, during the harvest season.They are now getting the price that they had been asking for the produce all these years: about Rs. 10,000 per quintal.The crop has been cultivated on 5,750 hectares this year, about 2,000 hectares lesser when compared to the previous year when the procurement price was in the range of Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000 per quintal.Owing to the adequacy of water, the productivity has also increased. Farmers, who had switched over to other crops considering the procurement price as low, are ruing their decision now.Unlike in the recent years, this time around, there has been a coincidence of a surge in productivity and remunerative price.
