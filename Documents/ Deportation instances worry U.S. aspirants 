Recent instances of deportation of students by authorities in the U.S. have become a worrying factor for the young aspirants from the city.Many students from both the Telugu-speaking States — Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — head to the U.S. with a view to pursuing higher education every year. A few even take up a job assignment in that country.But deportation of students having valid visa has put a question mark on this avenue.“The process of obtaining a seat in a university in the U.S. and the visa is rigorous. After going through the laborious process, it is the worse thing to happen for a student if he or she is deported because a particular university is blacklisted by the U.S. Immigration Department,” says Bhavana, a student of third-year engineering, who is preparing for GRE for a MS degree in the U.S.But Rama Sasank of Conduira says that students need not worry as this is just a bad experience like the Tri Valley case a couple of years ago.“The U.S. needs students from across the world to fund its education sector, and India is a big contributor. But the students need to do some homework,” he says.Recognised, but blacklistedThere is a need for some research before choosing a college or a university. Good universities need not be confused with recognised universities. Though many schools have been recognised by the authorities concerned in the U.S., quite a few are under surveillance.Both the universities from where the students had been deported were recognised, but blacklisted.Flexibility“A few institutions have come under surveillance for the ‘flexibility’ they offer — students are allowed to work outside and attendance is given to make up for the loss. Such colleges act as a front for students to work in the U.S. without the right permits. Such institutions should be avoided. Deportation of a group of students recently is a case in point,” says Mr. Sasank.
