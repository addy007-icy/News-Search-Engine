Water Resources Minister P.J. Joseph has said that the country is self-sufficient in food production and the farm sector should be protected. Hoisting the tricolour at the I.D.A. Ground at Vazhathoppe in the district on the occasion of Republic Day on Tuesday, he said that farm produces should get remunerative prices. If the Union and the State governments failed to fulfil this responsibility, the farm sector would degenerate, the Minister said. Though the State was known for cash-crop production, the fall in the prices had severely affected the economy.Rubber and cardamom prices had fallen considerably. He said that farm-related processing sector should also be strengthened. Human resources should also be protected along with natural resources, he said, adding that the achievements in education sector gave the nation a prominent place globally. The Stateâ€™s achievements in literacy should be tapped by providing employment opportunities to the youths.He also said that the local bodies should implement projects to make the villages self-sufficient. There should be water preservation measures in each household so that water scarcity being faced by the rain-rich State could be addressed.
