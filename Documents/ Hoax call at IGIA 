Security agencies at the Indira Gandhi International Airport hauled up the authorities of a gulf carrier for a delay of over three hours in informing them about a call that claimed a person travelling to Dubai on Monday had ‘terrorist’ links.The call, however, was later declared hoax. The security threat assessment committee, comprising authorities of the airport security, Delhi Police, CISF, Intelligence Bureau, immigration and counter-terror forces, also raised ‘concerns’ over the confusion prevailing between various stakeholders for filing an FIR. Officials said the security control room at the airport received a call at about 9 a.m. from the Mumbai office of a gulf carrier saying that a woman had informed its staff about a man with ‘terrorist links’ travelling to Dubai from Delhi. While the airline received the call at 5:30 a.m., the agencies at IGIA were informed later.After the call was received, the flight in question was brought under increased surveillance. — PTI
