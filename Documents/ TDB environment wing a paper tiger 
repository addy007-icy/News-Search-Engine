Though the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) is in possession of as many as 28 hectares of forestland at Sabarimala and 110 hectares at Nilackal, the temple administrative body still does not have a proper environment wing of its own. The existing TDB environment wing, which has no statutory powers, is headed by an assistant engineer who has three field assistants who have little technical expertise in environment conservation or pollution control.This skeletal wing is supposed to ensure the hassle-free functioning of the three incinerators each at Sabarimala and Pampa, two more at Nilackal, and the 15-year-old sewage treatment plant at Pampa. That is in addition to other tasks such as overseeing purification of Bhasmakulam, the temple pond, and the mini chemical treatment plant at Nilackal.
