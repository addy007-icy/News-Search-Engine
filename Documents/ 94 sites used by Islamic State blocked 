The Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) on Sunday said it had blocked 94 websites deployed by the Islamic State terror outfit as platforms to brainwash and recruit vulnerable youth.“The influence of the IS is clearly seen in Maharashtra and 10 other States,” said Anti-Terrorism Squad chief Vivek Phansalkar at a press conference here.The urgent decision was taken in the backdrop of the arrest of six individuals from various cities in an > anti-terror swoop conducted by the ATS in conjunction with the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Mr. Phansalkar said that a new website, to be extensively used for the purpose of de-radicalisation, would be launched soon.“We’re monitoring more websites and social media sites... any website used to propagate the IS agenda will be blocked. The IS emphasises the use of visuals in their recruitment modus operandi, with extensive use of pictures downloaded from various jihadi websites.”He said over 150 sites were currently under the radar of the security agencies.The recent arrests of 14 individuals across India suspected of IS linkages showed fine inter-State coordination between the ATS and the NIA. Mr. Phansalkar said Muslim community leaders had been roped in for confidence-building measures.
