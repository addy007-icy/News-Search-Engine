A witty person, ready with a joke or two to calm nerves in even difficult situations, and an eagerness to lead from the front is how Captain Satya Yadav described his course mate Lt. Col. Niranjan E. Kumar.The two met for the first time at the Short Service Commission 78 course in Chennai in 2003.“He was one of the brightest candidates and extremely physically fit. But, what stood out was his sense of humour. Even in difficult situation, he would make fun and crack jokes to calm those around him… I don’t remember every seeing him not smiling,” said Captain Yadav. The martyred soldier was also described as “extremely motivated” and this would often compel him to lead his men from the front.On September 17, 2004, he was commissioned into the 10 Engineering Regiment of the Madras Engineering Group. Having been trained in the technicalities of defusing bombs, forensics, screening and mining, Lt. Col. Niranjan Kumar found himself in the thick of action in anti-naxal operations in Chhattisgarh’s Narayanpur district.“His last tenure was at the NSG unit in Delhi. It was just around the time that he was blessed with a baby girl, nearly 1.5 years ago,” said Captain Yadav.
