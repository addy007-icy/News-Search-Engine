Jewellers in the city took out a candlelight march at Freedom Park on Monday evening, against the Centre’s recent move making PAN card mandatory for buying jewellery worth more than Rs. 2 lakh.The jewellery associations claimed there has been a drop of 25 per cent in transactions over the past fortnight. They dubbed the norm, which came into force on January 1, as impractical as the country has issued only 22.3 crore PAN cards till date. They said it was unfair to expect the industry to cater to only a cross-section of society.Sreedhar G.V., a jeweller, said, “We have taken representations to the Finance Minister and the Finance Secretary, and urged them to make PAN card mandatory on jewellery purchases of over Rs. 10 lakh,” he said.
