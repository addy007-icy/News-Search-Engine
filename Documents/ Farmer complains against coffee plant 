A local court has taken cognisance of a complaint by a local farmer against a coffee manufacturing unit, CCL Products (India) formerly Continental Coffee Ltd, at Duggirala mandal. The farmer has complained that untreated waste water being released from the factory has been polluting the canals besides causing air and water pollution.The farmer, Kancharla Srinivasa Rao, has filed complaint under Section 49 (1) (b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Polution) Act, 1974; Section 43 (i) (b) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; Section 19 (B) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.The Second Additional Judicial First Class Magistrate has posted the hearing to February 15.The coffee plant was established in 1996 by Challa Rajendra Prasad, engineer turned entrepreneur, in six acres at Duggirala village on the western side of Tenali-Vijayawada besides Buckingham Channel. The coffee plant now has five units spread across 25 acres. The company products include, flavoured coffee, chicory coffee, decaffeinated coffee and dried granules. In his complaint, Mr. Rao said the coffee plant management has laid a pipe line from the factory to the DRBC drain letting out untreated waste water into the canal, which is the life line for farm lands spread across hundreds of acres in the village. Citing Consent for Operation (CFO) order by the APPCB in 2007 that the industry has been using water far more than the permitted capacity, Mr. Rao filed a complaint in the local court.“Not only the factory has been violating all norms, it is also letting thick sludge which has been severely contaminated drinking water,’’ said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.The farmer also alleged that a large quantity of sludge has been accumulating dangerous pollutants and dumping them in the midst of agricultural fields and added that the factory has not adhered to green belt norms either.When contacted, the manager of the coffee plant who wishes not to be named refused to comment stating that the matter had been posted in courts.
