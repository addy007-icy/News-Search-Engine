The State government is contemplating reframing rules for recruitment of teachers in the wake of the High Court of Karnataka cancelling the existing rules, according to Kimmane Ratnakar, Minister of State for Education.Responding to questions from presspersons here on Saturday, Mr. Ratnakar said that legal opinion was being sought from the Advocate-General in the matter. “Once the rules are reframed, we can go ahead with the recruitment,” he said.According to him, the rules had been changed in 2002-03 in view of shortage of teachers with English Major and to provide for appointment of English teachers completing a nine-month course, and the High Court had now held that they (those completing the nine-month course) could not be treated on par with graduates with English Major and cancelled it.The Minister was also hopeful that the High Court would rule in the government’s favour in the issue of admission on merit to lower and upper kindergarten under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Mr. Ratnakar said that the High Court had granted a stay and called for arguments. “We are waiting for the court order on merit and I am hopeful that the order would be in our favour,” he said.GrantsHe said that apart from the regular grants being given to schools, an additional Rs. 40 lakh had been sanctioned to each one of the Assembly constituencies for providing drinking water and toilets in all schools.“We have released Rs. 30 lakh and the balance amount would be released soon. Instructions have been given to accord top priority for drinking water, followed by toilets and taking up repairs of buildings based on the availability of funds,” he said.He said that the government was contemplating modifying the constitution of School Development and Management Committees (SDMCs) to ensure that they functioned more effectively.
