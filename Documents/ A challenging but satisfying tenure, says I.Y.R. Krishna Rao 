Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary I.Y.R. Krishna Rao, who will be stepping down as the head of administration and handing over charge to his successor S.P. Tucker on Saturday, is bound to remember his tenure as a unique and challenging one given the circumstances following the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. He is also the most travelled Chief Secretary, shuttling between common capital Hyderabad and Vijayawada and working from both the places after Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu decided to shift to Vijayawada to be closer to people.“ But I am quite satisfied with and enjoyed my tenure though the first four to five months were tense due to bifurcation issues and with the Centre not keen to resolve issues firmly as provided under the State Reorganisation Act,” says Mr .Krishna Rao. Finally, it was left to the two State governments to coordinate and ensure that the tensions did not escalate.Known to be man who will not hesitate to speak his mind, Mr. Krishna Rao’s temperament certainly helped in pushing the government agenda for shifting administration to Vijayawada.Though employees initially were reluctant to move to Vijayawada when Hyderabad would remain common capital up to 10 years, Mr. Rao did not let indecisiveness linger for long and addressed the grievances of employees by taking it up with the Centre, particularly the concern for local status of employees’ children who moved to Vijayawada in view of the Presidential Order.Regular meetingsRegular meetings with secretaries to push the agenda of the government, accessing funds from GoI for Central schemes, getting special grant for Andhra Pradesh to set off its revenue deficit to some extent under the 14{+t}{+h}Finance Commission and setting up offices for Chief Minister, Chief Secretary in Vijayawada and promoting industrialisation and following it up regularly with those who came forward to invest in the State and laying stone for the Greenfield Amaravati capital were some of the high points.The most challenging administrative experience, he admits was during the Hudhud cyclone where he lent logistics support to the Chief Minister who rushed to Visakhapatnam and streamlining movement of essential commodities to the devastated city, organising Godavari Pushkarams on a mega scale though the inaugural day witnessed deaths due to a stampede.Mr. Krishna Rao, who travelled abroad to Singapore to follow up on the Chief Minister’s meetings with the Singapore government, the U.S. for Pravasi Bharatiya Divas to attract investments and the UK to receive the excellence award from Indo-European business Forum initiated a move for bringing back Buddhist relics and artefacts of Amaravati from the British Museum.He says priorities for his successor would be capital city construction, shifting of entire administration, completion of irrigation projects, managing finances.
