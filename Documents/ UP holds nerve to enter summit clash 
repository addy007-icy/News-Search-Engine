Eklavya Dwivedi scored a composed, unbeaten 49 (35b, 5x4, 2x6), but it was No. 9 Amit Mishra’s match-turning cameo (19 n.o., 9b, 2x4, 1x6) that helped Uttar Pradesh win a humdinger against Delhi and storm into the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy here on Monday.Given that Gujarat had beaten Jharkhand in double-quick time to boost its net run rate (NRR) to +1.180, Uttar Pradesh had to win its third and final game in order to upstage Parthiv Patel’s team. And it did so thanks to an all-round performance to maintain its cent per cent record (8 out of 8) in the competition.Seamer Mishra was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 4-0-25-2. Gautam Gambhir, who made 13 off 11, was one of his victims. If not for Unmukt Chand’s 48 (35b, 3x4, 3x6) and a late push from Pawan Negi (41 n.o., 23b, 4x4, 2x6), Delhi would have finished with fewer than 158.That tally seemed just enough after Navdeep Saini and Parvinder Awana removed openers Prashant Gupta and Samarth Singh in the space of six deliveries. Suresh Raina made a fluent 22 (18b, 4x4) before top-edging left-arm spinner Manan Sharma. His dismissal made it 44 for four.Dwivedi then batted sensibly, with useful contributions from the likes of Praveen Kumar (18, 13b, 1x6, 1x4). But when Kumar fell in the 18th over, Uttar Pradesh was still 35 away. That’s when Mishra singled out Subodh Bhati in the 19th over.A dot ball was followed by four byes. Mishra then produced two crisp cover drives and a six over long-on before taking a single off the last ball to bring the equation down to 10 off the last over, bowled by left-arm spinner Negi.Mishra collected three runs off the first two balls before Dwivedi smashed a six over long-on to equal the scores. A single sealed the deal.The scores: Delhi 158 for six in 20 overs (Unmukt Chand 48, Pawan Negi 41 n.o., Amit Mishra two for 25, Piyush Chawla two for 31, Kuldeep Yadav two for 29) lost to Uttar Pradesh 159 for seven in 19.4 overs (Eklavya Dwivedi 49 n.o.; Navdeep Saini two for 24). Points: Delhi 0 (4; -0.059), Uttar Pradesh 4 (12; +0.688).Jharkhand 142 for six in 20 overs (Virat Singh 29, Ishank Jaggi 39, Rush Kalaria two for 34) lost to Gujarat 146 for four in 20 overs (Priyank Panchal 35, Manpreet Juneja 33, Chirag Gandhi 25 n.o., Kaushal Singh two for 21).Jharkhand 0 (0; -1.714), Gujarat 4 (8; +1.180).
