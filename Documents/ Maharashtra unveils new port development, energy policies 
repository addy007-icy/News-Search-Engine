The Maharashtra cabinet on Monday unveiled two new policies for port development and power generation that encourage public-private partnership, and provides sops for improving connectivity of ports and production of solar power.The New Port Development Policy 2015 has been planned to synchronise with ‘Make in Maharashtra’ and ‘Ease of Doing Business’ policies. It will make Maharashtra Maritime Board’s role more industry-oriented to boost the development of ports. Maharashtra has a 720-km coastline with two big ports, and 48 small ports.The policy covers Greenfield ports, jetty, coastal, shipping and inland waterways, shipyard, coastal economic zone, and facilitation for maritime projects.“The new policy is aimed at kick-starting maritime development as well as supporting industrial activity with emphasis on port-related development. This policy will make Maharashtra import-export hub by development in water transport, shipping industry, port connectivity with road & railways,” tweeted Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.The government will provide concessions in Value-Added Tax, stamp duties, electricity duties, port tax and power tariffs. “The idea is to sync road and rail links, inland waterways, and coastal shipping to achieve coastal and industrial development. A Maharashtra Port Connectivity Corporation will be set up with participation from Sagarmala Development Company, Maharashtra Maritime Board, and Industries department,” a senior government official said.“The Corporation’s individual projects will be executed through a special purpose vehicle in which Connectivity Corporation will be the holding company,” said a senior government official. “Government institutions like Konkan Railway, Railway Development Corporation and PWD will participate.”The policy also envisages setting up shipbuilding parks. The Maharashtra Maritime Board will select the land and carry out the land acquisition process. “Industrial groups will be given these plots on a 10-year lease, and if required the lease period will be extended by another 10 years,” the official said.In the second key decision, the cabinet approved integrated solar off grid energy policy to encourage use of new and renewable energy. “This new policy aims to save 24 crore units of power in a year by producing 200 MW energy through solar equipments on rooftop,” CM Fadnavis said on Twitter after the cabinet approval.Chandrashekhar Bawankule, State Minister for New and Renewable Energy told reporters: “We want to promote power generation through solar panels on roof tops of educational campuses and government buildings as well as cooperative societies and private buildings.”Government wants to synchronise them with ‘Make in Maharashtra’ initiative
