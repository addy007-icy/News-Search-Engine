Taking exception to the alleged incident of the Vijayapura district prison authorities giving permission for hosting a dance show on the occasion of Republic Day, the Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded stern action be initiated against erring officials. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, BJP State spokesperson S. Suresh Kumar termed the episode in which some members of the audience threw currency notes on the woman dancer as an “insult to the State as well as the country”. The dance show was organised to mark the release of 38 prisoners.
