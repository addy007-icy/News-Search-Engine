: The Kasaba police have started a detailed investigation into an incident in which the tyres of a luxury vehicle parked on the compound of the City Police Commissioner’s office were partly damaged in fire last week.Police officials said the vehicle, which was seized in connection with a murder attempt case, was in the police custody for over a month. As the incident took place within the compound of the Commisioner’s office, the case would be considered very seriously, they added.As part of the scientific inquiry, experts from the Finger Print Bureau examined the vehicle in detail.A few fingerprint samples, expected to support the enquiry, were also collected from the spot.“We have no reasons to believe that it was done by someone with a motive to destroy the evidence in the Mohammed Sanu murder attempt case. The vehicle seized in connection with the case was not such a vital evidence to prove the charge,” said a senior police officer from the city.
