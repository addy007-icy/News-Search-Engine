The Ponneri tank – a massive structure set up by the Rajendra Chola I - close to the temple of Sri Brahadeeswarar in Gangaikondacholapuram in the district, realised waters during the north east monsoon. Situated about eight km from Jayamkondam and about one km away from Gangaikondacholapuram, its maximum storage level is 17 feet and the current level is 14 feet. “During the North East monsoon, the water level reached 16 feet and we had to keep a vigil in the low-lying areas,” says Public Works Department sources.The tank has a capacity of 114.46 million cubic feet and it irrigates about 1,374 acres in Pichanur, Kuruvalaparkovil, Ilayaperumal Utkottai and Ayudhakalam villages. “Paddy has been raised in these villages and the farmers are confident of raising ‘kuruvai’ after harvesting the present ‘samba’ variety,” official sources said.The tank, under the maintenance of the Water Resource Department of Marudayar Basin division in the district, has a total water spread area of 700 acres on either sides of the Jayamkondam – Gangaikondacholapuram highway.It has four sluices and the total length of the bund is 4,800 metres.Tourists plead for its beautification and development by introducing boat services. “With the nearby Chola temple attracting a large number of foreign tourists, the development of the tank would promote tourism in this part of the district,” they say.
