Chandigarh-based Socomo Technologies Pvt. Ltd., which launched the Jugnoo app, is planning to have 3,000 to 4,000 autos on board in the coming months. After starting with 150 Jugnoo autos, the company is continuing the process of adding more to its fleet.However, before enrolling autorickshaw drivers, the company ensures that the vehicle’s documents are in place. “We also insist on drivers bringing a police verification certificate,” said S.A. Shreeharsha, Jugnoo’s Mysuru head.Though Mysuru has more than 20,000 autorickshaws, according to records with the Transport Department, the Department of Legal Metrology said the number of autorickshaws that had recalibrated their meters had not crossed 10,000 last year. Besides, not all autorickshaws registered with the Transport Department could be plying in the city.Also, the autorickshaw drivers enrolling with the aggregator will need to have a smartphone. If the drivers don’t have one, the company arranges to finance the smartphone. “The software is very simple. It is integrated with Google maps for identifying the location,” he said. Commuters can pay online through Jugnoo wallet or Paytm. “Commuters also have the option to pay the fare directly to the drivers,” Mr. Shreeharsha said.
