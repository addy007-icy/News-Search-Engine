An English teacher has come up with simple ways to help rural children learn the language easily.S. Satyam at Zilla Parishad Secondary School at Mondrai village in Sangem mandal has turned the classroom into an English language laboratory by painting walls with colourful charts. The charts featuring both Telugu and English languages with diagrams explain to the children the tenses, adjectives, genders, parts of speech and so on which they can easily memorise.Speaking to The Hindu , he said learning and teaching the English language has become very important in the modern world to survive and prosper. “In rural areas, children are not well equipped and hence, I chanced upon this novel idea of painting the walls in classrooms,” he said.With over 20 years of teaching experience, he says he had gone through innumerable books on English teaching and synthesised his knowledge to improvise techniques to suit children in government schools in rural areas. “I can say this has proved the most effective method as many children picked up the language with great ease,” he said.He further explained that students could practice grammar rules even in the absence of a teacher. The target group is students of VIII, IX and X standards who could answer about 30 questions related to grammar in their final examinations.This novel method was helping students acquire English language skills on par with corporate school students.As many as 50 State-run schools across the district have adopted the system and students are able to score better in their examinations.Mr. Satyam was honoured with Best Teacher Award in 2011 and wishes that all the government schools adopt the method to benefit the student community.
