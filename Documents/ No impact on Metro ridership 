nlike expectations, the impact of the odd-even scheme for cars in the Capital did not really reflect in terms of ridership in the Delhi metro on day one.According to data provided by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, ridership in the metro network on January 1 was recorded at 19.08 lakh till 8 p.m. - the time when the 15-day policy is slated to end everyday.Even as the metro was visibly less crowded, stations and parking lots in the National Capital Region had a sizeable population.Many people who commute to Delhi from satellite cities like Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon preferred to take the metro instead of taking out their cars, lest they be impounded.“It was a lean day for Delhi metro on Friday in terms of the number of passengers using the service,” said a senior DMRC official.Last Friday, on Christmas, metro ridership was recorded at 15.87 lakh till 8 p.m.In fact, last to last Friday (December 18) which was a usual working day, the ridership recorded till 8 p.m. was 20.29 lakh.Explaining the reason for the average turnout on day one of the scheme, metro officials said, “The first day of the New Year was a Friday because of which many people might have taken leave from work to celebrate over the weekend.”The DMRC however, believes that the real test on whether the mass rapid transport system will be able to take the extra burden would begin only from Monday.In a bid to boost metro services for effective implementation of Delhi government’s odd-even scheme, the DMRC is running 70 extra train trips apart from pressing a total of 198 trains into service from its overall fleet of 220 trains.The average ridership of the Delhi metro climbed up to 26 lakh in 2015 with the highest ever ridership of over 32 lakhs being recorded on August 28.DMRC believes that the real test on whether the system will be able to take the extra burden would begin on Monday
