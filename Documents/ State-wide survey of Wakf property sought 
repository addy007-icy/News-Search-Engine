The All-Kerala Wakf Protection Samithi Kozhikode has called for a thorough and transparent survey of Wakf properties across the State and their proper documenting, alleging that many landed property of the Wakf was being used with commercial interests rather than for the intended charitable purpose.General Secretary of the Samithi Abdul Khader Karanthoor said here on Monday that the Samithi was formed in the light of irregularities in managing land and other forms of property donated by philanthropic members of the Muslim community. The organisation would be formally launched at a function here on January 15.DonatedMr. Karanthoor told presspersons that lands had been donated to build educational institutions, orphanages, mosques and many other establishments for charitable purposes. But, the Samithi found that documents that specified such purposes had been tampered with and the property sold for commercial purposes.Only 25 per cent of the property seemed to have been listed properly.At present, members of the community, including intellectuals and the influential, were involving themselves in redeeming the situation, owing to the general feeling that there was a Wakf Board and the government to handle this.But, the board did not seem to act, said Mr. Karanthoor. Therefore, the survey must be conducted and district-wise list, specifying the status of the property, must be available in the revenue department and Collectorâ€™s offices in every district.Also, there must be a mechanism that would enable people to easily access this information. Steps must also be taken to recover Wakf landed property that had been usurped.
