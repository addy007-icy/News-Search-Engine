Launching the three-day public information campaign organised by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) here on Thursday, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao urged the youngsters to make use of the Central government initiatives such as ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’ as opportunities were abound now.Pointing out how technologies had shrunk the world, Mr. Rao said that any information or opportunity available in any corner of the world could be known through Internet. “Digital India is about making technologies like Internet easily available to everyone and bringing governance closer to people. The State government has also given laptops to students. Use such initiatives constructively,” he said.Earlier, Mr. Rao visited the stalls set up as part of the campaign at the Madurai Medical College by State and Central government departments explaining various initiatives.The three-day event will mainly focus on Mission Indradhanush, Digital India, Skill India and initiatives for women empowerment and entrepreneurship.Special focus was given on the first day of the campaign to Mission Indradhanush, launched in December 2014 by the Union government to improve full immunisation coverage of children below two years of age.The authorities explained that of the 201 high focus districts chosen from 28 States, eight were from Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Tiruchi, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Vellore and Virudhunagar).
