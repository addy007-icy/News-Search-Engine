Will freedom of expression, a hotly debated issue now, be a focal point of 8{+t}{+h}Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes), which begins on Thursday? Considering the selection of films in the documentary section, it can be construed so. However, festival sources put it as ‘academic discourse on freedom of expression’.Films that have been chosen for screening in this section are: Forbidden Voice by Barbara Miller, The Life of Emile Zola by William Dieterle, Inherit the Wind by Stanley Kramer, Good Night and Good Luck by George Clooney and Sophie Scholl-The Final Days by Marc Rothemund.Forbidden Voices (2012) is about the fight for human rights and freedom of speech of three female bloggers from Cuba, China and Iran. It explores the motivation of the online activists’ struggles and traces the consequences and political repressions.The Life of Emile Zola (1973) is about French author Emile Zola. It was the second biographical film to win an Oscar. Zola intervened in the case of Dreyfus, a German army officer convicted of treason, and wrote an open letter, risking his own freedom and career to save Dreyfus.Inherit the Wind is a fictional version of the Monkey trial, which resulted in John T. Schopes’s conviction for teaching Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution to a high-school science class. The film is construed as criticism of McCarthyism and as a defence of intellectual freedom.Good Night and Good Luck (2005) is a historical that stars David Strathairn. It portrays the conflict between veteran radio and TV journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy on anti-communist actions.Sophie Scholl-The Final Days (2005) is about the last days in the life of Sophie Scholl, a member of the anti-Nazi non-violent student resistance group White Rose who was found guilty of high treason by a people’s court and executed.
