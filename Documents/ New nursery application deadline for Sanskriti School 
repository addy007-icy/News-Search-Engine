The Supreme Court extended the Delhi government’s deadline for submission of nursery application forms to the prestigious Sanskriti School till January 31.A Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave and A.K. Goel extended the January 22 deadline set by the Delhi government, even as the Apex Court decided to set up a three-judge Bench to decide the larger question of law on whether the society, which runs the school, comes under the definition of the ‘State’ defined in Article 12 of the Constitution.If so, the school, which has challenged a Delhi High Court decision to stop the 60 per cent reservation given to wards of Group A government officials, will have to comply with Article 14 of the Constitution, that is, right to equal opportunity for all. Again, if the court decides that the school is a ‘State’, the latter will be amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court concerned and the Supreme Court.The three-judge Bench has been scheduled to hear the case from January 21.The decision for a larger Bench to hear the matter was made after senior advocate Arvind Datar, who is Amicus Curiae, said there were contradicting judgments on when a society can be held as either a State or its instrumentality.He said a three-judge Bench should hear the matter and give a “once for all” authoritative view on the issue as to whether a society, managing the affairs of an institution or a sport, would be akin to the State.The Delhi government had, earlier, set the deadline till January 22
