At first sight, Prashant Ingale is a throwback to the non-professional actors used by iconic neo-realist luminaries like Vittorio de Sica and Roberto Rossellini in their films The Bicycle Thief and Germany Year Zero (both 1948).Ingale recently starred in the National Award-winning Khwada (Obstacle), which starkly chronicles the humanity of the dispossessed in its depiction of forced migration in the neo-realist mould. Born into a family of impoverished farmers in Shirur taluka, Ingale bagged the role serendipitously when the lead actor was deemed ‘not natural enough’ by director Bhaurao Kharade. He was paid Rs 15,000 for his role.So, when he attempted to take his own life by consuming fungicide in December last year, it was a macabre case of cinema verite , with the eerie blurring of reality and his celluloid role.The reason behind the attempted suicide, says his brother Anil, was Ingale’s inability to repay a Rs 3.5-lakh loan he had taken from local moneylenders to build a house. Though he was discharged last week after undergoing treatment at two hospitals in Pune, Ingale today is a bundle of nerves, perpetually bedeviled with headaches.As frequent instances of farmer suicides continue to cast a dark shadow on life in rural Maharashtra, Ingale’s attempt to take his own life due to financial problems illumines the old fault lines between a Bollywood heaving with grossly overpaid stars and Rs 100-crore publicity budgets and the straitened circumstances of the ‘meaningful cinema’ makers.Dire straitsThe making of Khwada , which won the Best Director and Best Sound categories at the 62nd National Awards in March last year, has been as dark and disturbing as the lives of its protagonists. Kharade, a vegetable seller, had sold five acres of farmland in Shirur to fund his project.“It was a unique situation in which the director and his crew were sailing in the same economic boat. We were merely playing ourselves, and at the same time were aware that the disaster chronicled in the film could very well befall us,” he recalls.Kharade says that while financing and publicity for independent filmmakers from rural areas remain a Sisyphean task, recently-released and critically-acclaimed films like Fandry, Court and Killa have shown that Marathi cinema can perform yeoman’s service to the genre of the ‘socially-conscious film’.Incomplete circleAkin to Karhade’s struggle is that of Santosh Ram’s, another ‘indie celluloid boondocker’ from Udgir in Latur district. Son of a schoolmaster, Ram worked as a data collector in Pune to support his dream of becoming a filmmaker, living in a room he shared with five other boys at the Mahatma Phule Hostel.He learned his craft by watching classics screened at a National Film Archives of India (NFAI) film appreciation course after failing to get admission to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). Dubbing himself an FTII ‘canteen pass-out’, Ram finally broke through with Vartul (Circle) in 2009 – a stunning 18-and-a-half-minute documentary that snared 13 awards across India and put him on the map.Vartul’s success, however, did not usher in opportunity the way Ram would have expected in Mumbai, and was followed by three bitter, disillusioning years in the city during which Ram recollects knocking in vain on the doors of production houses.“It eventually dawned on me that there is no open-door entry for the likes of us. Every assistant director I saw used to come in a car of his own. I felt I could not continue in this place where my output, which would have been mediocre anyway, would have been stifled by rigorous conformity to the system,” he says.Determined not to compromise on his art, Ram returned to Udgir and produced yet another brilliant short, Galli (The Lane). His ‘stock company’ is drawn from the drought-stricken parts of the State.Lacking the aristocratic moorings of a Visconti or a Rossellini, or the social eminence of Ray, Ram says funding for his films has come entirely through donations by friends with steadfast faith in his art.His much-anticipated full-length feature, China Mobile , deals with the impact of the digital world on rural Maharashtra as seen through the eyes of two teenagers. “I would not straitjacket these films with a label like ‘neo-realism’. Like a bitter pill, it is essential our films be sugar-coated as entertainment for audience consumption, yet deal with the larger social concerns of the day,” says Ram.Sunday theatre in LaturOne of his recruiting pools is 37-year-old Kalyan Waghmare’s ‘Sunday Theatre’ in Latur. Eking out a living by shooting wedding videos, Waghmare’s concept has wrought a pocketful of miracles in the district. Begun in 2008 with three friends, this exercise in drama therapy has changed lives of adolescents from the social margins.“The larger purpose has been to channelise their despair and troubled childhoods into the service of meaningful theatre and cinema,” says Waghmare. While establishing a strong sense of camaraderie, his Sunday Theatre has helped in emotionally stabilising and supporting teenagers, and in securing steady jobs as well.“The six years I spent with the Sunday Theatre was a revelation; it has changed my life for the better,” says Pratiksha Rajmane, who now works as a press co-ordinator in Latur.Kharade, a vegetable seller, sold five acres of farmland in Shirur to fund Khwada
