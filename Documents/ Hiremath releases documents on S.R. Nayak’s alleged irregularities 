Samaj Parivartana Samudaya founder-president S.R. Hiremath has released documents pertaining to the alleged irregularities committed by the former State Human Rights Commission chairman S.R. Nayak, whose name is being considered for the post of the Lokayukta.Releasing the documents at a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Hiremath said that he had submitted documents containing a five-page letter and 50 pages containing details of the alleged irregularities by Mr. Nayak to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Advocate-General Madhusudhan Naik.“We have requested the Chief Minister to share this information with the Governor and members of the Lokayukta selection panel for their perusal,” he said.Mr. Hiremath said that a sale deed of November 8, 2002 shows that the Karnataka Judicial Employees House Building Cooperative Society allotted a site (no 859/C) to Mr. Nayak when he was the judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court.Pending caseMr. Nayak bought this site measuring 6,175.5 sq ft for Rs. 3.7 lakh whereas government value at the time of registration was Rs. 13.59 lakh. Interestingly, it was a civic amenities (CA) site that cannot be allotted to an individual.In a case filed by the Judicial Layout Residents and Site Holders Association, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had submitted that this was among the 404 CA sites. The case is still pending in the High Court, he added.It was a case of violation of High Court and Supreme Court orders that stated that High Court judges, as constitutional functionaries, could not become members of employees cooperative societies and that they were not eligible for sites formed by any such society.The former judge of the Supreme Court Shivaraj Patil had to resign as Lokayukta for having a site in the same layout in his wife’s name. He later surrendered the site, Mr. Hiremath recalled.Similarly, in Kumta town of Uttara Kannada district, Mr. Nayak’s wife, Shalini, bought about four guntas of land at Rs. 15 lakh in 2005. The construction cost of the buildings on this land would come to Rs. 25 lakh-Rs. 30 lakh.The land located in a prime location, near the bus stand and the railway station, would cost about two-three times more than the money paid by Ms. Shalini. “Where did the money come from?” he asked.Besides, Mr. Nayak’s track record as head of KSHRC too was not impressive.‘We’ve urged Chief Minister to share the information with the Lokayukta selection panel’
