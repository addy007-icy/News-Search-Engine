Telugu Desam Party leader and former Sarpanch of Jerrela gram Panchayat in Visakha Agency Sagina Venkataramana was allegedly hacked to death by members of the banned CPI (Maoist) on Tuesday night. Venkataramana, 32, was actively involved in the anti-bauxite mining agitation.Jerrela had received forest clearance through GO No. 97 two months ago, which, in fact, facilitated the first step in bauxite mining. Maoists are going all out to support the agitation. Venkataramana had repeatedly maintained that no resolution in favour of bauxite mining had been passed by Jerrela Panchayat when he was its Sarpanch.On Tuesday night, around 11.30 p.m., Maoists reportedly reached Venkataramana’s house in the village, tied and beat up his family members and caused extensive damage to the house before taking him away.Some of the victim’s relatives were beaten up as they tried to stop the attackers from taking him away. Some 100 yards from his house, Venkataramana was hacked to death. A poster hung near the place and a pamphlet left behind alleged that Venkataramana got the resolution in favour of bauxite mining passed with forged signatures and also usurped patta lands with forged signatures. Agency people were also urged to chase out TDP and BJP leaders from the Visakha Agency.
