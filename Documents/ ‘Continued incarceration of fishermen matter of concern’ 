Following the arrest of 20 fishermen from the State in four incidents in a span of 24 hours by the Sri Lankan Navy, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention to secure their release. “The continued incarceration of the fishermen and their boats for extended periods and the apparent lack of any serious effort on behalf of the Government of India to obtain their early release has contributed in no small measure to the sense of despondency amongst the coastal fishermen community,” Ms. Jayalalithaa stated in the letter, a copy of which was released to the media here.Listing the State government’s efforts for the welfare of the fishermen community for which she had requested funds from the Centre, the Chief Minister said, “There has been no forward movement even on this proposal of the Government of Tamil Nadu in the last 18 months. I reiterate my request for early sanction of the proposal.”She further urged the Prime Minister to personally intervene on this issue and requested him to take up with the Sri Lankan government to secure the immediate release of 104 fishermen and 66 fishing boats presently in Sri Lankan custody.Eight fishermen from Nagapattinam district were arrested on January 4, and eight from Ramanathapuram district and four from Pudukkottai district were arrested by the Lankan Navy the following day.Jayalalithaa writes to Prime Minister yet againseeking his interference
