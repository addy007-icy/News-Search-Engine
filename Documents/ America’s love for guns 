To understand America’s gun culture, we need to go back to the very birth of the nation, which was soaked in blood (“In god and guns they trust”, Jan.19). Americans take pride in saying that fighting is in their DNA and remain trapped in the centuries-old tradition of carrying guns. While being besotted with weapons, they don’t realise that most people who become victims of violence are not terrorists but fellow Americans, ordinary, peace-loving citizens like them. Violence happens regularly in schools, hospitals, churches and the neighbourhood because of gun ownership. Against this backdrop, the present gun control measures advocated by President Barack Obama are highly welcome.T. Anand Raj,Chennai
