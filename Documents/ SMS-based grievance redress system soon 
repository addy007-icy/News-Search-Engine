The RTA, Vijayawada is mulling introducing an SMS-based grievance redress system for the applicants of driving licence.The department dispatches driving licences and registration certificates (RC) through post. Most applicants complain about the delay in obtaining the same and a few end up in getting traffic challans for failing to furnish a registration number plate on the vehicle or producing the licence when demanded by the traffic police. Under the new system, the applicants can lodge their complaints through an SMS and an acknowledgement will be sent. After processing the respective file, an SMS would be sent to the applicant about the status of their applications or complaints.If the RC is dispatched, the vehicle owner would get an SMS confirming the same. If any document is required, the applicant will be asked to approach the department, says Deputy Transport Commissioner V. Sunder.
