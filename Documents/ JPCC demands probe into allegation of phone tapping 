Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee (JPCC) on Sunday demanded a probe into the allegation of phone tapping made by former Chief Minister and JVM(P) President Babulal Marandi.“Phone tapping is a serious issue and the allegation has been made by a senior leader and former Chief Minister. Hence, JPCC demands a probe into the allegation,” JPCC chief Sukhdeo Bhagat said.Referring to Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das’s demand for an apology from Marandi if he failed to produce evidence within 24 hours to authenticate his allegation, Bhagat said the allegation should be substantiated with evidence. But, if the allegation is found to be true, culprits should be punished, he said.On Saturday, Marandi had alleged phones over 3000 persons, including bureaucrats, businessmen, contractors, journalists and even leaders of the ruling party, were illegally tapped and demanded a probe by a special investigation team under the supervision of a sitting Jharkhand High Court judge.
