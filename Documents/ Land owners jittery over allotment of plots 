The draft of the detailed master plan for the new capital of Amaravati released by Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) towards December-end has sown seeds of doubt among the land owners, especially those who had voluntarily parted with their lands under the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS).The CRDA, which has announced that allotment of reconstituted plots would begin from February 1 on lottery basis, would faced an acid test as it is likely to face a backlash from land owners in the capital region.The draft master plan has classified the entire capital region into commercial, residential and business zones, besides earmarking areas for administrative buildings, High Courts and legislative buildings. But, it is raising anxiety among land owners who now fear that they would be allotted residential and commercial plots far away from their villages.“We have parted with our lands after being promised that we would be given developed plots near to our village. But, it appears the attitude of the officials have changed after the land acquisition,” said Bellamkonda Suresh, a land owner from Thullur. Further, the prevailing uncertainty over allotment of reconstituted plots in commercial and residential zones is making the land owners more apprehensive. “The State government seems to be hale bent on circumventing the promises made during the implementation of Land Pooling Scheme (LPS). In Clause 14 of Form 9.3, the government has stated that land owners will be given the choice of selecting the location of the plots and in various clauses in Form 9.14, the CRDA has mentioned that reconstituted plots will be allotted in the area nearer to the villages. But, the in the detailed master plan, the plots have been shown far away from the villages,’’ said Karumanchi Anil Kumar, a resident of Krishnayapalem.In this village, locals worry that the express highway proposed between Undavalli and Inavolu village would pass through the village, forcing some people to evacuate.It appears that the attitude of officials has changed after the land acquisition- Bellamkonda Suresh,a land owner from Thullur
