A diplomatic row flared up between India and Russia on Monday over the weekend deportation of Father Seraphim, a priest with the Russian Orthodox church, from Chennai.Condemning the action, in an unusually strong statement, the Embassy of Russia said, “Disrespect, shown to a priest from a friendly country, goes against the spirit of mutual affinity and cooperation characteristic of Russian-Indian relationship.”‘Denied assistance’The Russians have accused the authorities in Chennai airport of not showing humanitarian consideration to the elderly priest.“Unacceptable is the fact that the Russian diplomats were denied for seven hours contact with the priest at the airport. He was also denied basic assistance, including food, despite the requests from the Embassy and the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Chennai.”The Hindu had earlier reported that Father Seraphim, who was to take part in a special prayer on Monday in Chennai, was deported as he had only a tourist visa. Official sources admitted that the Indian side could have handled the case in a better way.“There appears to have been a mistake in the handling of the case. However, the Ministry of External Affairs is not in a position to do anything in this matter,” said an official, indicating that the deportation was dealt with by another department of the government.Former Ambassador of India to Russia, Rajiv Sikri, however, pointed out that taking up of the matter by the Russian embassy should not be considered as a sign of crisis in bilateral ties. “This is a local incident and it is unlikely that the statement reflects an official position on India-Russia ties by Moscow,” Mr. Sikri said.
