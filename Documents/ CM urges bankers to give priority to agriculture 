Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has urged bankers to extend their cooperation in making agriculture profitable. He also wanted them to accord top priority to farm loans.Addressing a seminar on ‘State credit’ organised by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) here on Wednesday, Mr. Naidu said NABARD had proposed to provide Rs. 1.21 lakh crore for priority sector lending in the State for 2016-17 year.The Chief Minister felt that bankers’ participation in horticulture, dairy, fisheries and agriculture was not on expected lines. At a time when the government was targeting double-digit growth, it was not appropriate to ignore priority sectors.“The government is taking up massive programmes to conserve water. To achieve the set targets, it is necessary to sanction loans. Financial institutions and bankers should come forward to achieve double-digit growth,” he said.KDCC Chairman Pinnamaneni Venkateswara Rao, Andhra Bank Managing Director and CEO Suresh N. Patel, NABARD Chief General Manager Harish Java, State Planning Board Vice-Chairman Kutumba Rao and Special Chief Secretary T. Vijay Kumar were present.
