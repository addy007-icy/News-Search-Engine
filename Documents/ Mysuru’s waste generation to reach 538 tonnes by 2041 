With solid waste management turning into one of the biggest challenges for urban managers and planners in cities, sustainable planning for handling waste generated in future is the need of the hour with solid waste generation going to go up substantially in the years ahead.As solid waste management is a key indicator to rate the cleanliness of cities, the caretakers of the country’s Swachh city – the Mysore City Corporation – has proposed to launch two more plants for converting waste into manure as it is projected that the city’s daily waste generation will go up to 538 tonnes from the current 400 tonnes by 2041.In his presentation on “how Mysuru got the cleanest city status under Swachh Bharat Mission” at the 103rd Indian Science Congress here on Thursday, MCC Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath said the biggest challenge for the municipal authorities is waste management and cities have to prepare for it starting now.Under Swachh Sarvekshan, which accords new ratings to cities, 60 per cent weightage had been given to solid waste management, he said, adding that the city is already planning for the future and preparing itself for garbage challenges.More vehicles will be procured for waste collection besides setting our focus on 100 per cent waste segregation at source even as doorstep collection of garbage was cent per cent in the city, he informed.The Commissioner maintained that open defecation was almost nil in the city and only 629 applications had been received from the people when the corporation invited applications lending financial assistance for building toilets.More vehicles will be procured for waste collection, besides focusing on 100 per cent waste segregation at source even as doorstep collection of garbage was cent per cent in the cityC.G.
