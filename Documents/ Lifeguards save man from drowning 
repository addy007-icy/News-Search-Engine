Alert lifeguards posted on the Kollam beach saved a 67-year-old man from drowning in the evening on Monday.The man, identified as Vishwnathan residing at Kallumthazham in the city, went alone to the beach and entered the waters to wash his feet at about 3.30 p.m.Soon a huge breaker that hit shore pulled him into the waters. The lifeguards who quickly sensed trouble rushed to the spot but by that time Vishwanathan was carried some 20 meters away from the shore.Four lifeguards, led by Dolphin Ratheesh, dived into the waters and soon rescued Vishwanathan. He was by then panting and gasping for breath. The rescue operation was also clicked by a photographer who happened to be there.The lifeguards informed the police, and soon Vishwanathan was rushed to the district hospital in a police vehicle and admitted there. Doctors said he was out of danger. The other lifeguards who were in the team are Satheesh, Anil Kumar, and Shaji Francis.Over the past several years, more than 40 people had drowned on Kollam beach after being pulled into the waters. Though boards had been put on the beach warning visitors to stay away from the shoreline, many ignored the warnings.Waters hitting the shore there are highly unpredictable. Lifeguards say the waves, which generally look calm, may suddenly turn dangerous after hitting the shore. Marine experts term this phenomenon backwash.
