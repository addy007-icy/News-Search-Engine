Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Virinjipuram has warned farmers of blast disease – a fungal disease - affecting standing paddy crops in the district. The misty weather in Vellore district has turned conducive for the fungal growth, leading to sporadic attacks in various parts of the district.M. Pandiyan, professor and head, Agricultural Research Station (ARS) and KVK, Virinjipuram said the rice blast disease was spreading fast in several parts of the district. There was good growth of paddy crops following rains.“We visited a few affected fields after farmers started to approach us. The fungal attack has been occurring in the last two weeks. It has been attacking short duration paddy crops of 105 to 110 days,” he said. A number of paddy fields in parts of Anaicut, Latheri and Virinjipuram were affected by blast disease.Day time temperature below 28 degree Celsius and cloudy weather, and night time temperature of 19 degree Celsius was conducive for the fungus growth, he said, adding, “The present misty weather in the district is conducive for the fungus growth. One variety of rice – CO 51 – has been found resistant to the disease attack, while it is sporadically seen in rice varieties such as ADT 36 and ADT 43.”KVK has issued advisory to farmers to reduce or even stop use of urea as it will pave way to fast fungal growth. “Spots in the shape of eyes on the crops are the symptoms of the disease. It will affect all parts of the crops leaving burnt-like symptoms. We are advising farmers on appropriate use of fungicide in proportion to their field area to control the fungal attack,” he added.During the farmers’ grievance redressal day last week, the scientists advised farmers not to go by the suggestions of shop keepers for use of fungicide. Farmers were asked to bring samples of the affected crops to KVK and ARS for appropriate advice on control measures.
