This is the result of a barrage of phishing cases where criminals procure a duplicate SIM card and siphon off money from the victim’s bank account.At present, net-banking facility is linked to the account holder’s mobile phone number. But criminals have started exploiting a loophole — they procure a duplicate SIM card. Borase Bhushan Gulabrao, Superintendent of Police, Cyber Crime, said they would shortly be writing to telecom service providers and banks to bring in new norms for customers who had been issued a duplicate SIM card. They would be advised to visit their branch physically to re-enrol for net banking. “This will plug the loophole,” he said.However, this needs a system where databases of telecom service providers are in sync with that of banks.The police have come down heavily on telecom service providers, including BSNL, for giving out duplicate SIM cards without proper verification. Recently, while pursuing the case of a gang that hacked online wallet apps of Axis Bank, the CID learnt that a single telecom provider had reissued a hundred SIM cards without proper verification. “Service providers need to put up stringent systems in place or we will start booking criminal cases against them,” Mr. Gulabrao said.Criminals procuring duplicate SIM cards to siphon off money from bank accounts, say cyber police
