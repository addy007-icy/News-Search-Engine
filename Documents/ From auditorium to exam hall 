Watching a play can help one relax. But that is not all. Watching an hour-long play can also help pre-university students fetch 30 marks in their Kannada exam.Scores of first year pre-university students thronged Ravindra Kalakshetra here on Thursday to watch the play Beppu Takkaddi Bole Shankara written by Chandrashekar Kambar. The play was performed by the Nandana cultural troupe.The play is included in the first year pre-university Kannada syllabus .The troupe also performs another play- Krishnegowdana Aane - written by Poornachandra Tejaswi. This is part of the second year pre-university syllabus.About 15 artistes are part of these performances. The troupe has staged nearly 70 shows in various city-based colleges and other auditoriums.Dev Nagesh, president of the troupe, said, “We believe that watching the play will help students visualise and understand the story much better.”The troupe has conducted over 500 shows over the past 20 years on plays pertaining to college syllabi. H.S. Sathyanarayana, Kannada lecturer, Government Girls’ PU College, Basavanagudi, appreciated the troupe’s efforts and said, “We teach this lesson over a period of several days and there is no continuity.
