The budget session of the AP Assembly will commence from March 1 and it will be held in Hyderabad.Though there was speculation that the session will be held at Haailand resort in Guntur district as Speaker K.

Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, Finance and Legislative Affairs Minister Y. Ramakrishnudu indicated that the budget for 2016-17 would be presented on March 5 and the agriculture budget on March 8. The session is expected to be around 25 days and a final decision on the duration would be taken at the Legislative Affairs committee meeting to be held on first day of the session.Responding to queries on capital city, he said that the Master Plan implementation, land acquisition and other activities would be done as per the amendment to the AP Infrastructure Enabling Act approved in the legislature.There is also a stipulation that one of the joint venture companies to take part in the construction of the capital should necessarily be one public sector company. The proposal sent by a Singapore-based organisation also was in conformity with this stipulation, he said.
