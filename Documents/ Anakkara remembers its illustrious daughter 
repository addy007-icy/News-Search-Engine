Ninety-five-year-old freedom fighter G. Susheela, bedridden for six years, has vague memories of her last meeting with her cousin and celebrated dancer Mrinalini Sarabhai, who died on Thursday. “Several years have passed and I am unable to recollect the exact date,” she said. “In May 2011, Mrinalini visited our ancestral home for two days as part of an all-Kerala tour. A group of film and theatre activists from Ahmedabad had accompanied her. They filmed her moving around in the paddy field and areas close to the village temple,” recalled Mrinalini’s cousin Malini Achuthan, 86.“Although she was born and brought up outside Kerala, Mrinalini had strong affection for Anakkara and the 120-year-old Vadakkath Tharavadu,” said Malini.Susheela, who underwent two years of imprisonment at the Vellore Central Jail for taking part in the Quit India Movement, shared a rare camaraderie with Mrinalini. “Mrinalini had a lot of energy. She wrote several books, apart from devoting herself to promoting classical dance.”Vadakkathu Tharavadu has given birth to illustrious persons such as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal, who led the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in the Indian National Army. Captain Lakshmi, who died at the age of 97 three years ago, was Mrinalini’s sister.
