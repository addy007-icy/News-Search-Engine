When the BJP made gains, electorally, after the general election, the BJP’s president, Amit Shah’s management style was hailed. As long as the Modi wave was intact, Mr. Shah hogged the limelight. But after the massive drubbing in Delhi and Bihar, there was a rise of dissent (“Ahead of polls, BJP banks on Shah”, Jan.25). The BJP president’s inability to directly connect with party workers in Delhi and rest of the country was in stark contrast to his organisational prowess in his home State, Gujarat. Many crucial States face elections this year, and though the BJP’s stakes are not exactly sky high, Mr. Shah has the onerous responsibility of propelling the BJP in the right direction and remaining relevant. Since he will be in the saddle till the run-up to the 2019 election, he has the chance to propel the party to further glory.Ganapathi Bhat,Akola, MaharashtraThe reelection of Mr. Shah is not surprising as he is the one most favoured as far as the Prime Minister is concerned. Having worked together in Gujarat they share identical views and a vision. However the defeats in the two State Assembly elections have cast a shadow on the marketability of the BJP, given the fact that both the Prime Minister and the party president worked hard during electioneering. Two of the States which will have elections shortly are not exactly bastions of the BJP and it remains to be seen how the party president proposes to change the pattern of voting.G.
