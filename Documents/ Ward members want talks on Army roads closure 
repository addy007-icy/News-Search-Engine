Undeterred by refusal during the last Secunderabad Cantonment Board meeting, elected ward members of Cantonment are planning to push for discussion on closed roads at the next meeting, scheduled just days before the crucial GHMC elections.The GHMC polling is scheduled on February 2, which is being seen as a test of popularity for the ruling TRS party in the city.Residents campaigning against closure of roads in Cantonment by the local military authority seek to utilise the polls to exert pressure on elected SCB ward members in the hope that the latter would prevail over the Army establishment.Seven of eight members are affiliated to the ruling party.A representation was made on Monday to the board’s vice-president, S. Keshava Reddy, alleging that certain procedures under the law were not followed before roads were closed.Mr. Reddy is said to have assured the petitioners that the ward members would seek to move a resolution against the closure at the next board meeting scheduled on January 29.If the last board meeting held in December 2015 is any indication, it remains to be seen if the ward members can bring the matter up for discussion. During that meeting, the board’s president, Brigadier A.S. Negi, refused to allow a resolution to be moved. He stated that the Defence Minister was seized of the matter and there was nothing that could be done locally.Sources in the board indicate that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had reservations over opening the closed roads. The six-month relaxation in keeping Gough Road open instead of heeding to mounting civilian pressure to completely keep open all closed roads, is indicative of such concerns, they said.
