According to the police, her family members said that Govindamma was ill since the last few years and that the family had raised loans to the tune of Rs. 3 lakh for her treatment, while the earnings of the family was dwindling by the day.

Jaganmohan Reddy visited a few such families and demanded that the government immediately release the compensation amount.On the other hand, several such cases of suicides continue to rot at various stages of consideration by the officialdom, right from the police to the revenue authorities, while the kin of such families rapidly disintegrate into various forms of labour and often migrate.The deceased was among 20 weavers who committed suicide unable to bear the burden of debt
