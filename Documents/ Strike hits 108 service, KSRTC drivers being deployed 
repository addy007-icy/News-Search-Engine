However, we are running the service with the KSRTC drivers and other government ambulances and nurses from government hospitals,” said Syed Suhale Parveez, Senior Manager of GVK EMRI.He said if the employees failed to withdraw the strike, the organisation would on Thursday initiate action under ESMA.Meanwhile, Health Minister U.T. Khader, who took stock of the situation and discussed the issue with district health officers (DHOs) and district managers of GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute directed the company to ensure that people are not put to hardship.“If any ambulance stops, the district manager of GVK EMRI will be held responsible,” he said.He further said that the organisation has been directed to identify the “mischief mongers” and initiate action against them.“We have also provided the list of government ambulance drivers (those who are running the Nagu Magu and other government ambulances) to the 108 call centre.
