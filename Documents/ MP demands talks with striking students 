CPI(M) leader T.N. Seema, MP, has demanded that the authorities of the University of Hyderabad hold immediate talks with the students who are on a hunger strike demanding action against those responsible for the suicide of Dalit student Rohith Vemula.In a press note issued here on Saturday after a visit to the varsity campus, she said top varsity officials, including the Vice Chancellor, had committed grave mistakes in handling the situation which led to the suicide of the research scholar.The Vice Chancellor did not care to listen to the students, against whom punitive action was taken. He acted in a partisan manner as per the dictates of the BJP and ABVP leaders, the press note said.Union Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani who issued letter after letter through her officers demanding action against the students, terming their actions anti-national, also cannot escape responsibility for the student’s death. When in the past MPs had taken up cases of harassment of students in other universities like Pondicherry University, no such action was forthcoming from her.Minister’s roleHer unwarranted intervention in the matter, on behalf of her party’s student organisation, amounted to coercing the university authorities to expel five students, including Rohith Vemula.The announcement of a judicial inquiry was only to deflect public opinion and to save the skin of the two Union Ministers involved in the incident, the press note said.President’s interventionMs. Seema urged the President to intervene in the matter and to call a meeting of the Court of the University, the press note said.
