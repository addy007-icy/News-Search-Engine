Unwilling to give up on a seemingly jinxed series against India, Pakistan Cricket Board’s Executive Committee Chairman Najam Sethi said the PCB can spare a fortnight for the matches should the Indian government give its go ahead.Asked about the recent statement from the BCCI Secretary Anurag Thakur that there was no chance of an Indo-Pak series in 2016 due to the choked calendar of the Indian team, PCB’s Najam Sethi said it can be done.“Our stance remains that if the Indian government gives permission to BCCI we can sit down with them and take out 10 to 15 days for a series this year,” Mr. Sethi said.Mr. Sethi, a former Chairman of the PCB, said he saw no reason why a window for a short series of three one-dayers and two T20 matches can’t be taken out this year.“It can be managed in 10 to 15 days. It will be our effort to have series if both governments give green light for cricket,” he said.“We will wait and now since they didn’t play in December as per the MOU signed between the two boards the liability of giving us a home series is on them they owe us one more series. We have decided whenever we play now we will not tour India and it will be our home series at any neutral venue,” he added.“The logic is that the host board must earn from a home series and that is why we want to host whenever the next series is held.”
