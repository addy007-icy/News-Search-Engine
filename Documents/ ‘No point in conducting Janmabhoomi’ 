There was little use in conducting the third round of Janmabhoomi with 28.52 lakh applications and petitions submitted in the first two rounds still pending, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) official spokesperson Kolanukonda Sivaji said.In a statement here on Friday, Mr. Sivaji cautioned the public in going to the phase of the Janmabhoomi Maa Vooru programme with “high expectations”. He said that the people should utilise the opportunity to take the State government to task for all the unfulfilled promised it had made to them before and after the general elections. Listing out all the promises made by the Telugu Desam government to Backward Classes (BCs), other weaker sections, weavers, women and farmers, the PCC spokesperson urged the people to question the government to give them a time frame for the fulfilment of all promises.Mr. Sivaji said the Special Development Funds released for development projects were being used by the TDP as the party funds. The SDF funds should be allocated to TDP MLAs in all Assembly Constituencies in the State wherever they were available. It was not proper for Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to allocate the funds to party leaders in constituencies where the party did not have an MLA, he pointed out.The Special Development Funds released for development projects are being used by the TDP as party funds- Kolanukonda Sivaji,PCC spokesperson
