The Arilova Police had registered a case on a complaint filed by his parents and he was sent for remand to the Central Prison. “We were busy with the Republic Day celebrations, when the accused consumed the cleaning liquid on Tuesday evening. We rushed him to the KGH, where he died while undergoing treatment late last night,” Jail Superintendent Srinivasa Rao said. “He was upset that his family members were against seeking bail for him.
