Days after it introduced a separate category for transgenders in its admission forms, the Jawaharlal Nehru University now plans to go a step ahead and grant five extra points to those who apply under the category.The proposal came to light after the University constituted a special committee to formulate a detailed policy to carve out the modalities of admissions for transgenders.Deprivation pointers categoryConfirming the news, a JNU co-ordinator said: “Transgender applicants will fall under the deprivation pointers category if the proposal is passed. We have proposed that five extra points be awarded to students seeking admission under the category.”The University’s admission policy already has a provision for five “deprivation points” for women, Kashmiri migrants and applicants from the Defence category.In its endeavour to propagate gender equality, JNU had also opened an option for transgenders in the nomination forms for its students’ union elections.Supreme Court judgmentAfter a Supreme Court judgment declaring transgenders as the third gender in 2104, the University Grants Commission (UGC) made it mandatory for all colleges and universities to include a third-gender category option on their admission forms.
