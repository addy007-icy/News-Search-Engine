Hyderabad Central University (HCU) on Monday informed the Hyderabad High Court that it has revoked suspension of four students, against whom action had been initiated along with Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula, who allegedly committed suicide.The counsel of the four students, who had earlier filed a petition challenging their suspension, however, said that they were not served with the order copy in this regard.The High Court made note of the proceedings and directed the counsel of the HCU to file before it the documents of the circular/order on revocation of the suspension along with the counter affidavit to be filed on the petition challenging their suspension.The High Court then posted the matter to February 12.On January 21, the HCU in a statement had said, “The Executive Council of the HCU, after taking into account the extraordinary situation prevailing in the university and after discussing the issue in detail, resolved to terminate the punishment imposed on the students concerned with immediate effect.”The HCU had in September, 2015, suspended five students D. Prasanth, Vijay Kumar, Sheshaiah Chemuudugunta, Velpula Sunkanna and Rohith Vemula, for six months (entire semester) for allegedly assaulting ABVP leader Susheel Kumar in August.But, the suspension was later revoked. However, in December, while allowing them to attend classes, the HCU had denied them access to the hostel.The five research scholars including Mr. Vemula under the umbrella of a Joint Action Committee, had termed their suspension (except classrooms and workshops related to subject of their study) from hostel as “undemocratic” and a “social boycott”.Mr. Vemula was found hanging in a hostel room on the HCU campus on January 17. After the alleged suicide, the issue sparked strong reactions on the campus.
