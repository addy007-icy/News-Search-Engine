Virender Sehwag drew in a few hundred spectators at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Civil Lines on Saturday afternoon.Alas, he couldn’t do any better than tally three runs in five balls, fall into the leg-side trap masterminded by R. Satish and produce a direct hit from mid-on to send Abhinav Mukund back.The remainder of the match belonged to Tamil Nadu, which displayed a professional brand of cricket to emerge winner by nine wickets in a Group ‘A’ fixture of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Choosing to bat, Haryana was done in by some smart bowling from medium-pacer W. Anthony Dhas (3.1-0-10-4) and off-spinner M. Ashwin (4-0-28-3). But it was skipper Satish who set the tone for a commanding performance by dismissing Sehwag.The right-armer packed the on side with fielders, cramped the great batsman for room and induced a false stroke to have him caught in the cow corner.Nitin Saini (50, 44b, 3x4, 1x6) batted well, but Haryana managed no more than 113 in 19.1 overs.Tamil Nadu lost Abhinav in the second over but the chalk-and-cheese combination of S. Aniruda (54 n.o., 47b, 8x4) and B. Aparajith (49 n.o., 42b, 5x4) knocked off the runs in 16 overs to complete a facile win.Saha silences criticsWriddhiman Saha may have cemented his place in the Test team, but he has always found it tough to prove his worth in the shorter forms of the game.In the first match of the day in the heart of the city, Saha silenced his critics in style with an authoritative yet cultured 81 (47b, 7x4, 5x6) as Bengal thrashed Hyderabad by 61 runs.Saha was a connoisseur’s delight, executing textbook strokes with ease on either side. He milked the pacers and spinners alike to dominate the 138-run opening stand with left-hander Sayan Mandal (50, 41b, 4x4, 1x6) as Bengal posted 185 for four on a batting beauty.Saha displayed his nous with the ’keeping gloves, too, with a couple of acrobatic saves, a catch and a direct hit from close range.Chopra carries batPrashant Chopra (89 n.o., 62b, 7x4, 2x6) carried the bat as Himachal Pradesh held its nerve to post a five-wicket win over Gujarat at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Jamtha.The scores: Haryana 113 in 19.1 overs (Nitin Saini 50, W. Anthony Dhas four for 10, M. Ashwin three for 28) lost to Tamil Nadu 116 for one in 16 overs (S. Aniruda 54 n.o., B. Aparajith 49 n.o.).
