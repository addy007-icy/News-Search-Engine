CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has demanded the resignation of the United Democratic Front (UDF) government in the wake of the High Court’s rejection of its appeal to stay the Thrissur Vigilance Court order against Excise Minister K. Babu.Mr. Balakrishnan told reporters here on Monday that Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, by moving an appeal against the Vigilance court order, was attempting a short cut to retain Mr. Babu in the Cabinet. Since the appeal had been rejected, the government had no moral right to continue in office.Mr.B abu had said that he was quitting on moral grounds and the court had not made any observation against him. Mr. Chandy should clarify why he went on appeal against the verdict. The government had lost its collective responsibility, he said.The High Court had observed that there was no prima facie defect in the Vigilance court verdict. The Advocate-General who came under the Chief Minster had accused the Vigilance of playing politics in the case. This was against Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala who was holding the Vigilance portfolio. KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran and the UDF leaders should clarify whether they shared the same opinion about the Vigilance, he said.Kerala Bar Hotels Association working president Biju Ramesh had bribed former Finance Minister K.M. Mani and Mr. Babu as per the directions of Mr. Chandy and hence a thorough probe would definitely expose Mr. Chandy’s role, he said. — Special Correspondent
