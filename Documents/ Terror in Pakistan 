Pakistan is slowly becoming victim to its home-grown terrorism (“ >Think like the neighbour”, Jan.23). The attack on Bacha Khan University, which killed mainly students, is reminiscent of the Peshawar terror attack in which scores of school-children were killed. One of the major ways Pakistan can eliminate/reduce terrorism is by providing the right education to its youth and taking stern action against those directly or indirectly involved in running terror outfits. In its own interest, Pakistan also needs to end its policy of targeting India in the name of Kashmir. The state needs to gain control over the deep state, consisting of the Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). It needs to show action on bringing perpetrators of terror attacks like those on Pathankot to justice.M. Kumar,New Delhi
