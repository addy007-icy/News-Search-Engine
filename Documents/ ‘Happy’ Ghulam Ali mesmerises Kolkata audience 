Before he sang Fasle aise bhi honge, Yeh Kabhi socha na tha (We never thought distances will be this large), Ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali said on Tuesday that though he was visiting the city after a gap of only four years, it seemed “half-a-century had passed.”“I was very sad but today it seems that days of my sadness have come to an end,” the singer said before a packed gathering at the Netaji Indoor Stadium here.Mr. Ali, whose concert in Mumbai last year had to be cancelled due to the Shiv Sena’s opposition, thanked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and said she had bestowed “blessing on him like Goddess Saraswati”.Film director Mahesh Bhatt, also present at the event, was more direct in his praise of the Chief Minister and described the event as nothing short of a miracle.“We had almost given up hope of celebrating the great singer given the atmosphere that was created in Mumbai,” he said. Even though Ghulam Ali’s son Aamir Ali was to perform before him, the ghazal maestro took the stage first and mesmerised the audience.Ms. Banerjee used the opportunity, which coincided with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, to emphasise religious tolerance.“Music has no boundaries. Swamiji used to say that our religion is for the world, it encompasses all, takes everyone in its fold, loves the humanity and it’s the cradle of civilisation and culture.”Pointing out that Swami Vivekananda spoke about tolerance Ms. Banerjee said: “without tolerance this world cannot exist.”
