It’s been two days now. Students of the government Kannada-medium school in Kerur village of Chikkodi taluk have been climbing down a 30-foot-deep open well for a glass of water. The students, after lunch, step through a treacherous route to the well, which is in an open field, as both the borewells on the school premises have stopped functioning.But, neither the school authorities nor the gram panchayat officials have made alternative arrangements to appease the thirst of the 1,200 students of the school.When Deputy Director of Public Instruction of Chikkodi Education district, Gajanan Mannikeri, was asked about the plights of the students, he said the gram panchayat’s development officer would make alternative arrangements at the earliest.He said the Block Development Officer had already visited the school to assess the situation. Meanwhile, appropriate action would be initiated against the concerned officials responsible for the failure of borewells.Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram in Belagavi was also apprised of the situation, Mr. Mannikeri said, and promised to see that students do not have to run to the well for water from Saturday.
