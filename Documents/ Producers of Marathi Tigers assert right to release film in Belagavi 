With the controversial Marathi film Marathi Tigers set to release on February 5, producers have been asserting their right to release the movie in the border district of Belagavi. The film revolves around the border row between Karnataka and Maharashtra.Film producer Abhijit Tashildar said that he was willing to knock on the door of the court if Karnataka made any effort to obstruct its release in any part of the State.This comes in the light of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patil, who is also in-charge of the boundary dispute, saying that the government would take “suitable action as per law” if the film sparked off violence.Regional Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of Belagavi N. Jayaram did not rule out the possibility of recommending to the government to ban the film.The producer claimed that the film was made on the basis of “facts”, but does not provoke sentiments or harm linguistic harmony and peace.Amol Kolhe, who is playing the lead, said the film was viewed and cleared by the Censor Board, where one of the officials was from Karnataka. “But Karnataka is trying to impose a parallel censorship on the film,” he said.‘Unnecessary’Senior MES leader Malojirao Ashtekar said that some Kannada groups were “unnecessarily making an issue of the film, which is yet to be released and viewed.”He said even if a character in the film was demanding transfer of Marathi-dominated areas in Karnataka to Maharashtra, it should not be a matter of worry for the simple fact that MES has publicly been demanding this for five decades.
