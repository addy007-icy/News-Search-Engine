Pricol plans to become one of the leading automotive solutions provider in the world by establishing two greenfield projects and making overseas acquisitions for which it will set apart Rs.500 crore, said a top company official on Wednesday.Briefing reporters, Vikram Mohan, Managing Director said, “The expansion and acquisition would cost us about Rs.500 crore. More than Rs.300 crore would be met through internal accruals and the balance through debt. We are not going to put money in real estate as we are planning to operate on asset-light model. We will approach industrial park developers who can offer us custom-built building as infrastructure. We will put the money into more productive assets like machinery.”The company had come out with a Vision 2020 statement to become a top player in the global arena by entering new markets such as Vietnam and Mexico through acquisitions and tapping new product segments.The Vision 2020 statement calls for increasing its leadership position in respective products and achieving a consolidated revenue of Rs.3,000 croreCurrently, Pricol has eight manufacturing units located in India, Sao Paulo and Jakarta.

The new product segments include telematics and body control modules, asset management solutions, centralised lubrications systems and cabin tilting systems, said G. Sundararaman, President, Pricol.Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Mohan said: “Within the next four years, we would like to be among the top three or top five players in geographies in which we are operating such as India, Europe or North America. By 2020, we should be known as automotive solutions provider instead of automotive components manufacturer.”Pricol is looking to acquire companies in pump and sensor verticals either in the Europe or the U.S. The management will consider those firms that score high on technology, leadership, customer base, finance and quality of manufacturing.
