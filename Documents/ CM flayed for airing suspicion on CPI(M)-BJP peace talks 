: A day after the Jana Raksha march led by KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran was flagged off from here, BJP leader V. Muraleedharan has accused Chief Minister Oommen Chandy for making ‘derogatory’ remarks over the proposed move to hold peace talks between CPI(M) and the saffron party to end political violence.Mr. Chandy’s remarks at the flagging off function of the KPCC march at Kumbla on Monday that the proposed peace talks between the two rival parties could be a political gimmick gave credence to the suspicion that the CM did not want to restore peace through talks between the CPI(M) and the RSS, Mr. Muraleedharan said.The positive stand adopted by the CPI(M) on the RSS leadership proposal to hold bilateral talks to end recurring political violence in Kannur is by and large hailed by the public.However, it is sad that Mr. Chandy alone aired suspicion over the sincerity of the proposed talks, the BJP leader said. The BJP, despite its political and ideological difference with the CPI(M), wanted to hold peace talks with the Left party to say that there is no place for violence in the society, he said.It is ironic that the KPCC president had to lead a State-wide march as the five-year tenure of the Congress is drawing to a close, he said alleging that the march was taken not to save the Kerala society but to pocket money by the Congress leaders.Mr. Muralieedharan was addressing a leadership meet of party activists in Kasaragod-Manjeshwaram segments at Uppala.
