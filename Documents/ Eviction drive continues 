As part of its efforts to widen the Adyar river, the Water Resources Department continued its eviction drive along the river near Saidapet.According to officials, nearly 100 structures in Thideer Nagar, Saidapet, were removed and residents were given alternative housing at flats constructed by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board in Perumbakkam. In the past 10 days, the department has removed nearly 1,000 buildings along the river, including Aathma Nagar, officials said.Nearly 10,000 encroached structures have been identified to be removed from various stretches of the Adyar river that runs for a total distance of 42 km. The department plans to start an eviction drive at Anusuya Mandapam , said officials. Resistance from residents in Mallipoo Nagar also delayed the eviction.The drive to remove encroachments along the banks is progressing at a slow pace as there are not enough employees in Revenue Department to survey and demarcate the boundary of the river. Once the illegal structures are cleared, the width of the river will double from the existing 50 metres in Saidapet, officials added.
