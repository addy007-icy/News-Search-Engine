Nawab Shafath Ali Khan, the Hyderabadi sharp-shooter, and his team from Bihar’s Forest Department have successfully shooed back an elephant that strayed out of the forest. The tusker aged around 15 years created panic in the villages of Gaya district in Bihar. It had come from the forest of Jharkhand State.“On Thursday morning, we sent away the elephant into the adjoining Aurangabad district. The need to tranquilise it did not arise, we just burst crackers and beat drums and sent it away into the deep forest,” Mr. Khan told The Hindu over phone from Gaya district. No sooner did the forest officials heave a sigh of relief, news of another tusker creating panic in Bhagalpur district broke out. “Another young tusker had strayed into the fields and was moving towards human habitats. Around one to two thousand villagers have surrounded the elephant and the local police were trying to keep them away from the tusker. The forest officials apprehend it could become aggressive and attack people. Now our teams are rushing to the district,” he said.
