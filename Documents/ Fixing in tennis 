Tennis is an enthralling sport that has been mesmerising everyone even if many of us are not well-versed in its intricacies. So far, we have been under the impression that the sport was not vulnerable to any kind of malpractice. However, we have been taken by shock by the recent news on match-fixing by even top players involved in the sport (â€œReport by media outlets claims big-time match-fixing in tennis, Jan.19).Those found guilty should not only be condemned and black-listed but should also be stripped of their medals, trophies and prize monies. The bookies should also be tried for spoiling the healthy competitive environment and cheating the unsuspecting sports-lovers all over the world and handed stringent punishment.M.L.Raghavan,Tirupur
