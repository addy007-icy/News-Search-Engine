Based on inputs from the Home Department, the district police have deployed additional forces.Entry of the public into the cave shrine, a disputed site, has been prohibited for three days from Sunday. This was communicated to the people visiting the dargah on Sunday morning. There is, however, no restriction on visiting the hills.K. Santhosh Babu, Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu on Sunday, “We have beefed up security in Sringeri, Horanadu, Lakkavalli, and Baba Budangiri. This is to avoid any untoward incident either before or during Republic Day celebrations,” he said. “There has been an all-India alert. There is no specific information on threat to any of the places in the district,” he said.The official said prohibiting entry into the cave shrine would not affect the public as the number visiting the place was very small.
