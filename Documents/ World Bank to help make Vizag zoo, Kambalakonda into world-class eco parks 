In a first of its kind, Hudhud-devastated Indira Gandhi Zoological Park and Kambalakonda Nature Park will get a total funding of US$8 million from the World Bank for rebuilding as well as to convert them into world-class ecological parks within two years.After a visit to the zoo, a World Bank team said on Tuesday that for the first time they were funding a zoo and hoped that due to its locational advantage in an area of 625 acres and close proximity to Kambalakonda Reserve Forest, it would soon become a major attraction for animal lovers and researchers.The zoo set up in 1972 had suffered heavy loss of enclosures, day and night crawling centres, veterinary hospital, roads, cabling, drinking water supply network and surveillance system when heavy winds lashed the city on October 12, 2014. The zoo is the home for 788 inmates including tigers, lions, white tigers, cheetah, hippos, giraffe, panthers and primates and 120 species.The amount had been sanctioned as part of $370 million for Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests R.G. Kalaghatgi told The Hindu .The World Bank has also sanctioned $12 million for ecological protection and livelihood in Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari districts under the project.World Bank team leader Deepak Singh said their aim was to convert Vizag zoo a major hub for environmental activity and animal lovers in a short time.He said if required they would allot more funds for the zoo project. The team went round the zoo and enquired from the staff as to how they could save the lives of the many of the inmates when the killer-cyclone made a landfall at Kailasagiri Hill, pretty close to the zoo. “As part of our efforts for conservation of biodiversity, we want to lay emphasis on providing a decent habitat for the zoo inmates and promote it as a place for research and studies on flora and fauna,” Neha Vyas, senior environmentalist at the World Bank’s India country office, said. A Power-Point presentation was made after the visit. Senior officials of the Forest Department told the team that they were in the process of finalising a consultant for preparation of a master plan to develop the zoo and the Kambalakonda Nature Park.
