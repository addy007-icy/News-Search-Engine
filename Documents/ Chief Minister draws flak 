The Lok Satta Partyâ€™s GHMC wing on Wednesday charged the State government of announcing unrealistic boons that would reduce the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) from a surplus to a situation where it finds hard to pay the salaries of employees.Citing data collected through an RTI, it said the GHMC income in the year 2014-15 was Rs.2,340 crore and an expenditure of Rs.2,202 crore, that left it with a surplus of Rs.140 crore. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has so far announced new projects that would require funds to the tune of Rs.5,471 crore, it said, while wondering from where the rest of the budget would come from.
