Narayanasamy said.While the central leadership of Congress has slammed the government over the recommendation to impose President’s Rule in the state, party MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh who revolted against Mr. Tuki, on Sunday welcomed the move and said they were ready to form an alternative government with the support of BJP and others.Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel accused the Centre of practicing “coercive federalism” and resorting to a “systematic harassment of non-NDA state governments”.“When SC is hearing Arunachal matter what is motive behind President’s rule? We are seeing a systematic harassment of non-NDA State Govt’s (sic).“They promised Cooperative federalism but delivered Coercive federalism. Cabinet move on Arunachal another brazen attempt to murder democracy,” Mr. Patel said on Twitter.Calling it a “travesty” of Constitutional mandate, party’s Communication department chief Randeep Surjewala said, “President’s Rule in Arunanchal is trampeling of democracy & exposes Modiji’s double speak of states being equal part of ‘Team India’He added “Modi Govt’s imposition of President Rule in Arunanchal Pradesh reflects travesty of Constitutional mandate & subjugation of federalism.”Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was expected to today apprise the President about the decision of the Union Cabinet to recommend imposition of President’s Rule in Congress-ruled Arunachal Pradesh.The decision by the Centre came at a time when Supreme Court is hearing petitions on the political crisis.
