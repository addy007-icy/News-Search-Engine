An exclusive Kerala Maritime Board and a joint water control room at Fort Kochi are among a host of steps recommended by K. Padmakumar, Additional Director General of Police (South Zone), who carried out a comprehensive study on last yearâ€™s Fort Kochi boat tragedy, which claimed the lives of 11 persons.In a comprehensive study report submitted to the State government last week, Mr. Padmakumar called for establishing a joint water control room along with a watch tower at Fort Kochi to monitor and regulate the movement of different types of fishing boats. The facility should be run by a joint team of officers from the Indian Navy, Coast Guard, Fisheries and Coastal Police and be equipped with trained life guards, speed boats and ambulance boats and all types of life-saving equipment, it suggested.All fishing boats, both entering the sea and returning to the harbour should give prior information to the control room regarding their movement.The report also moots the proposal of an exclusive maritime control board for the State having powers to monitor and regulate all types of vessels. Further, a coastal FM radio station could be established to give weather updates and inform about emergency situations to fishermen onboard.Observing that the Mercantile Marine Department has not been conducting its srank and driver examination since 2010, it also calls for resuming the same at the earliest.Besides, steps should be initiated to curb the unbridled rise in tourist boats while the shallow portions of the Kochi backwaters should be made navigable through drudging.It also notes the formation of a sand bank near the Vallarpadam International Container Terminal, which would prove disastrous for boats in the future. Hence, a sign warning the danger should be put up, it said.
