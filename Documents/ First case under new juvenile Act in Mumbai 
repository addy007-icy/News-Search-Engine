In the first case registered under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the Social Service Branch (SSB) of the Mumbai Police on Saturday raided two commercial establishments in Null Bazaar and rescued four minors, who had allegedly been forced into child labour. Two accused have were arrested.“In earlier cases of child labour, we used to apply the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, along with the Child Labour Act, which made the arrested accused liable for rigorous imprisonment up to three years. With the new JJ Act, which was applied in Saturday’s case, the accused face up to five years of rigorous imprisonment,” said DCP (Enforcement) Pravin Patil.According to officials, the four boys, who are all under 14 years of age, were rescued from the kitchens of the eateries. The managers of both the eateries were arrested and handed over to the JJ Marg police.The Act was introduced in Parliament in 2014 after outrage over the lenient treatment given to one of the accused in the 2012 Nirbhaya case, who was a few months away from being 18 years old. It was passed by the Rajya Sabha in December. It allows for juveniles, who are 16 years of age or older, to be tried as adults for heinous offences such as rape and murder. It came into effect on Friday, officials said.“While the thrust of the new JJ Act is on juveniles in conflict with the law, it also provides for juveniles in need of care and protection. This is why it is applicable in cases like child labour and flesh trade involving minors,” Mr Patil said.
