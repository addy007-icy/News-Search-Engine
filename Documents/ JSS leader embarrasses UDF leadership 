The appearance of Rajan Babu, leader of the splinter Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samithi, with SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellapally Natesan at the Aluva police to bail him out in a case in which the latter is accused of inciting communal passions has visibly embarrassed the United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership.It virtually blunts the strong attack that the Congress leadership had launched against Mr. Natesan. Mr. Babu accompanied Mr. Natesan at the time of his arrest by the Aluva police.Mr. Babu’s action was similar to that of Janata Dal (United) leader M.P. Veerendrakumar, who recently shared a platform with CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan. Mr. Babu had earlier come in for criticism in a UDF meeting, but the coalition leaders were inclined to accept his explanation then that his ties was merely professional.Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan promptly came out with a statement alleging that the UDF’s stand against Mr. Natesan who has been spewing communal vitriol as bogus.
