The family of Jamir Ali, a migrant worker who died in an accident at a worksite in Perumbavoor, has been denied the insurance claim under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. The scheme compensates death or disablement of the policy holder caused due to accident or accidental injuries. They have also not received proper compensation for his death from his employer.In a letter dated December 15, 2015, the insurance company turned down the claim on the ground that the post-mortem report had termed Ali’s death as natural due to Occlusive Coronary Artery Disease.However, initial reports said the 45-year-old died after he was electrocuted while operating an electric saw at the worksite on August 24 last year. The hospital to which he was rushed declared him brought dead at 10.45 p.m. and attributed the reason to an electric shock.Similarly, a death certificate issued by the Mazhuvannur grama panchayath also stated that Ali had died while being taken to a hospital after suffering an electric shock from the Airapuram Rubber Park, his workplace.The post-mortem report, however, said the victim died due to a heart disease and certified it as a death due to natural cause – a reason cited to deny the due compensation to the dependants of the deceased.Legal action to be sought“This shows how our system works to deny a migrant labourer even the insurance amount, which is due to him. We are now seeking a legal action against the police surgeon at the Ernakulam General Hospital, who conducted the port-mortem of Jamir Ali,” said Fr. Sabu George Malayil of Jeevika Migrant Workers’ Movement and an advisory committee member of the Buildings and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, Labour and Skills Department.Officials with the Ernakulam Rural Police said they had not given any report that influenced the post- mortem. “There is no way we can influence the autopsy report, as the report is purely based on the post- mortem examination,” said Anil Kumar, Deputy Police Superintendent, Perumbavoor.Earlier last month, Chalima, wife of Jamir Ali had come to Kerala in the hope of getting some compensation for his death. The company had offered to give a meagre compensation of Rs.1.50 lakh, with some riders though.
