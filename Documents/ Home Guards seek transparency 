A large number of Home Guards staged a protest outside the office of District Commandant in Saraswathipuram here on Wednesday.They were protesting over the delay in payment of salaries. They also demanded that the authorities concerned bring out a clear policy on the rotation of their duties since many have been deprived of work for almost a year.The protesters alleged that the Home Guards were supposed to be rotated once in three months. However, this rule was flouted to benefit a section of the Home Guards, they said.The services of Home Guards had been availed by the city traffic police for management of traffic.A few of the protesters alleged that a few Home Guards managed to remain posted to one particular traffic police station for several months, while a few were transferred often or kept off duty.The injustice must be set right immediately taking suitable steps against the officials concerned, they demanded.Additional Superintendent of Police Kala Krishnaswamy, who is officiating as the Mysuru district commandant until permanent posting, rushed to the spot and assured of looking into their demands at the earliest.A large number of guards were protesting over delay in payment of their salaries
