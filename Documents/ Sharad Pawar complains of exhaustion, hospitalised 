Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar was admitted to the city’s Ruby Hall Clinic late on Sunday evening after he complained of exhaustion. Doctors said the 75-year-old politician’s condition was stable and he would be discharged on Monday.Party sources said Mr. Pawar’s frenetic schedule and constant travel had perhaps contributed to his condition.The NCP chief was in the city for a book launch at the Bal Gandharva Rangmandir in the morning. Mr. Pawar’s health has been a source of constant speculation in recent years.In 2013, he had complained of uneasiness while on a visit to Sangli district and was compelled to cut short his visit. In 2012, Mr. Pawar was admitted to Mumbai’s Breach Candy Hospital. NCP leaders, eager to dispel alarm, then said it was for “a routine medical check-up”.
