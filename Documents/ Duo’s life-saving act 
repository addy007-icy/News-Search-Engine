The mini-bus echoed with laughter and song of doctors and interns returning from a trek to Anantagiri hills on Sunday evening before it stopped at a roadside eatery in Bandalguda. All the doctors stepped out to stretch and walk into Dwaraka hotel, when a miracle happened. Rather, two doctors Dr Faizah Anjum and Dr Savitri Devi, performed a miracle on a road accident victim.Armed with just a pen and a newspaper the quick thinking doctors created a bespoke contraption to save a life. “It was 7 p.m., as the other doctors went into the restaurant we were resting when the driver said he would move the bus as there was an accident. We rushed there and waded through the crowd to see the victim lying on the road near the divider. He had feeble pulse and his pupils were dilated and we got to work,” says Dr Faizah Anjum.The accident victim was a 30-your-old man, who while running on the road, slammed onto an onrushing RTC bus and fell aside near the divider, informed an official of Narsingi police station.“We started work on him right there without moving him on the road itself,” says Savitri.“We kept a pen to keep his tongue from blocking the air passage. While Savitri used the newspaper to blow air into his lungs, I kept working on his chest for the CPR. After about 20 minutes, the patient came to his senses and started breathing on his own and even started screaming. Then the ambulance came and we gave him an IV drip before he was taken to the tertiary care centre of Osmania General Hospital,” said Faizah.So, how does it feel to have saved a life? “It gives a sense of satisfaction and purpose,” said Savitri Devi.
