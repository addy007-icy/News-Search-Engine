Aiming at faster movement of trains, the railways has commissioned the electrification of 140-km Ghaziabad-Moradabad section, a key link between Delhi and Howrah, at an estimated cost of Rs 155 crore.The electrified section will be used as an alternative rail link for the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Moradabad-Lucknow-Sultanpur- Varanasi-Mughalsarai route bypassing the over-saturated Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad-Mughalsarai section.This will result in faster movement of passenger trains and higher traffic on Varanasi-Lucknow-Moradabad-Delhi route, an official release said.Introduction of suburban trains on Ghaziabad-Moradabad section will also provide faster rail link between Delhi and Ghaziabad to the towns and rural centres in western U.P. Faster movement of freight trains on electric traction will help the agricultural sector, sugar industry, and craft industry of U.P. - PTI
