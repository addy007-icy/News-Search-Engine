“The Bharatiya Janata Party had offered me around Rs.15 crore to Rs. 20 crore to join the party as part of ‘Operation Lotus’. But I did not accept it,” senior Congress leader and government Chief Whip Ashok M. Pattan has alleged.He made this statement to counter the allegations that he was among those who worked against Veerkumar Appaso Patil, the Congress’ candidate in the recently held elections to the Legislative Council from the local bodies constituency in Belagavi. At a press meet here on Saturday, he said, that he was “born and brought up in the Congress.” “Nobody can question my loyalty. To me, working against the party is equal to matra droha,” Mr. Pattan said.Asked to identify the BJP leader(s) who made the offer, he said that he could not name any particular leader now, as it would be difficult to prove it.
