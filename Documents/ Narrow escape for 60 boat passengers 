At least sixty passengers travelling in a mechanised boat had a miraculous escape on Tuesday morning, after the boat capsized in a water channel at Upputeru near Gollalapalem village in Krithivennu mandal.According to Krishna District Fisheries Department Deputy Director A. Solomon Raju, the operator had allowed more passengers than the capacity to board the boat crossing the channel from Gollalapalem to Patapadu in West Godavari district. The boat capcized owing to the heavy weight and low depth of water. Some passengers from Chinna and Pedda Gollapalem swam to reach the fish market at Patapadu, while others were rescued by boatmen, he said.
