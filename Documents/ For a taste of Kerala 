Though the intricate movements of Kathakali are tough to master some will do whatever it takes to try their hand at learning the mudras .One such was Henry Golding, presenter of BBC’s The Travel Show . His attempt in enacting the art form took place at Kochi recently during the shooting of an episode for the programme.The performance was from ‘Narakasura Vadham’ (The Killing of Narakasura), an 18th century play. The event was organised for the BBC team, which was on a six-day visit to Kerala to film an episode on the State’s culture and nature-endowed destinations.Mr. Golding also climbed a coconut tree in Alappuzha as the BBC team filmed locations in the town to capture visuals of a coconut climbing competition between traditional climbers and those who use machines for climbing the trees.What’s in a name?The age-old discussion over the renaming of Cochin International Airport Limited after K. Karunakaran seems to have settled down, at least for the time being.Official sources said the Union government was toying with a proposal to stop naming airports in the country after famous personalities and instead call these projects after the nearest city.

The Congress-led UDF government also expressed its keenness for the same.John L. Paul and Hiran Unnikrishnan
