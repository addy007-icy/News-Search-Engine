Social responsibilities of the banking sector will take a back seat if state-run banks start functioning like their private counterparts, Prabhat Patnaik, economist and political commentator, said.Mr. Patnaik, who was also the Vice-Chairman of Kerala State Planning Board, said the government first should stop interfering in their functioning and pressurising the public sector undertaking banks to grant corporate loans.India could not have achieved green revolution, strengthen the priority sector lending in agriculture, fishery, small business and other sectors without the PSU banks, he told delegates at the 20th All India Conference of Corporation Bank Officers’ Organisation here.The state-owned banks should focus on strengthening the domestic market as the economic slowdown across the world has shrunk the market affecting exports from India.This can be done through promoting education, health and agriculture sectors in rural areas, he said. Private banks will not be able to achieve this and public sector banks should go back to the 1960’s making a specific demand with the central government in this regard.No to privatisationAll India Bank Officers’ Confederation President Y. Sudarshan said trade unions are opposed to privatisation of public sector banks. Citing non-performing assets as one of the grounds for privatisation is myth, he said.A majority of the bad debts can be attributed to corporates and the government should empower public sector banks to recover non-performing assets.Mr. Sudarshan also said the unions are opposed to the proposed Industrial Relations Bill, seeking to consolidate various laws pertaining to trade union and other industry-related activities.The government could achieve many of its projects due to the public sector banks. When officers and staff work overtime to implement government schemes they should also be compensated properly, he said.The two-day conference is being attended by over 2,500 delegates from across the country.
