According to a proposal by Standing Committee chairperson Mohan Bhardwaj, interest and penalties for that period will be waived off if the defaulters make the payments before March 31.Mr. Bhardwaj, who proposed the scheme in his budget speech to the House on Thursday, said the exemption will apply to all those who owe property tax from the period after the unit area method of calculation was implemented in 2004. Mr. Bhardwaj also proposed a 15 per cent rebate for industrial estates that pay property tax by June 30.Currently, those who don’t pay their property tax before June 30 have to pay an interest of 1 per cent per month for that financial year, plus extra penalty for subsequent years.Meanwhile, certain relaxations were also proposed by the EDMC’s Standing Committee chairperson Lata Gupta.During her budget speech, Ms. Gupta said a 5 per cent rebate on property tax would be given to parents of a single girl child, and an 8 per cent rebate for parents of girls studying in municipal schools.
