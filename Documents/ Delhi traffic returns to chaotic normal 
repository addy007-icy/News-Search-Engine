: Crawling traffic was witnessed in many parts of Delhi a day after the odd-even experiment came to an end. As expected, many commuters took to social media to directly link the bumper-to-bumper traffic to the car-rationing formula.The traffic snarls were witnessed in the morning hours of Saturday and returned to haunt the commuters in the evening. What left commuters miffed was that the situation existed on a weekend when fewer vehicles are expected on the roads.In the morning, traffic congestions were witnessed on roads leading up to or passing through Dhaula Kuan. Beginning around 9 am, jams continued until afternoon on West Delhi’s Pankha Road, stretching up to Uttam Nagar.Chock-a-block traffic was reported on roads connecting Central Delhi’s Jhandewalan to Shadipur, Vikas Marg, Burari Bypass, IIT Flyover and Outer Ring Road.The situation was even worse in the evening as commuters had to wait 45 minutes just to cross the ITO intersection. “It took me more than 30 minutes just to reach ITO signal from the nearby Tilak Bridge,” said Shikha Singh, a banker.Many others used the traffic jams to demand re-implementation of the odd-even policy. “…The state of Delhi traffic today stands as a testimony that it was successful… #OddEvenSuccess,” posted a Twitter user Samir Faraz.Demanding that the policy be brought back, an independent filmmaker took to Facebook to describe how a journey from DLF in Gurgaon to Gulmohar Park in South Delhi took her 90 minutes on Saturday, as against just 40 minutes during the 15 days of the scheme.However, some other commuters as well as the Delhi Traffic Police social networking websites blamed a host of other factors for the traffic jams.“There were at least four non-functional major traffic signals on a 10-km stretch of road in Central Delhi today,” said Ranjeet Sharma, a commuter. The traffic police blamed many of the jams on broken vehicles, construction of foot-over-bridge, etc.
