After a successful launch last year of the Tamil Nadu International Balloon Festival (TNIBF), Department of Tourism Tamil Nadu, Sharnalayam and Global Media Box (an international Media development and Events Company) bring back the hot air balloons and this time they promise to be bigger and better.The Balloon Festival will take off at Pollachi and will offer visitors a unique flying experience atop a sea of lush green coconut trees and stunning landscapes.TNIBF 2016 will be held from January 12 to 16 at Sakthi Mills Pollachi. As part of the celebrations a music concert will be held at Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, on January 14.Eight hot air balloons from six countries will participate. These balloons feature regularly in festivals in Albuquerque, Dubai, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia and other global festivals.There will be cultural shows and fun contests for students, besides food counters and music to add to the colour. The idea is to make TNIBF a calendar event that will attract both national and international tourists to it. It is extra special as it coincides with the Pongal festival that is celebrated with so much fanfare in this region.The events are distributed between Sakthi Mills Ground, Pollachi â€“ Coimbatore Main road, Pollachi and Kumaraguru College of Technology, Saravanampatty, Coimbatore.For details contact phone: 9500090850/9488254204.
