The Cricket Association of Bihar (CAB) wants the BCCI to implement the recommendations of > Justice R.M. Lodha led panel so that cricket activities could resume in the state after 15 years.Bihar lost its Full Membership and voting rights after the bifurcation of the state into Bihar and Jharkhand in 2000.“It is of utmost urgency that the > BCCI immediately implement this recommendation of the > Lodha Committee and recognise the Cricket Association of Bihar, so that further losses are not caused to the cricketers of the State,” CAB Secretary Aditya Verma said.“The recommendations are welcome and encouraging for the young cricketers. For the past 15 years, the only victim of the policy of the BCCI towards Bihar has been the game of cricket. Bihar is one of the most populous states in the country and due to the discriminatory policies of the BCCI, a full generation of players have had to suffer.“The unequivocal recommendation of the Lodha Committee for the grant of full membership to Bihar has vindicated the stand of the Cricket Association of Bihar. The BCCI was formed primarily to further the objects of the game of cricket in the entire country,” Verma added.The CAB Secretary lamented that Bihar does not even have a team participating in any first class tournament conducted by the BCCI, including the Ranji Trophy and they get no financial supports for development of the game.The Lodha panel recommended that all states should have only one team and one vote. It means that states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat, who have three teams each, will have to give full membership to only one team and relegate the other two as associates without voting rights.
