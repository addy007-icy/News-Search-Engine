There is a telltale upswing in the interest and curiosity surrounding a 95 year old football event that splits the city apart in distinct loyalties every time it is held. The decibel is on the ascendance once again as debates intensify on which one of the two — East Bengal or Mohun Bagan — will emerge victorious ahead of their 338th meeting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday evening.Being one of the oldest football derbies in the world, the first meeting of the new year between the two has generated quite a heat with hundreds of supporters lining up for tickets outside the two clubs. Mohun Bagan, as the defending I-League champion and with back-to-back wins at home, is tipped the favourite.East Bengal has a clean edge in statistics having won 123 while Mohun Bagan has 103 wins overall. Even in the I-League head-to-head East Bengal has won 14 times and lost 11 times on the 36 occasions the two have squared up against each other.Currently, Mohun Bagan, with six points, is sitting pretty on top of the current standings while East Bengal, having won one and drawn the other in its two outstation ventures, is placed lower in the rungs.“The Kolkata derby is always about making a statement, stats do not matter here. You do not play the derby on paper and worry about statistics. Derby is different, it is about pride,” said East Bengal coach and former international Biswajit Bhattacharya.What will be keeping the East Bengal supporters in a tizzy is the fact that Mohun Bagan will have the full cast of its foreign recruits — Trinidad and Tobago striker Cornell Glen, Haitian forward Sony Norde, Japanese midfielder Katsumi Yusa and Brazilian Luciano Sabrosa — keeping it high on form and formidability.What is keeping the Bagan fans upbeat is that East Bengal has only two fit foreigners (Nigerian striker Ranti Martins and defender Bello Rasaq), one doubtful starter in injured Korean striker Do Dong Hyun and an absentee — the former French international Bernard Mendy, who is yet to arrive despite formalising a contract with the club.“We are always hopeful of getting three points. I do not want to talk big but would like to play and show it on the ground,” Sanjoy Sen, who guided Mohun Bagan to its first I-League triumph (its previous three were NFL crowns) last year, said.
