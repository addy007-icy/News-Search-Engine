The Vishwa Prani Kalyana Mandal has launched a public campaign to discourage people from sacrificing animals at the Chikkalluru Siddapaji Jathra festival in Chamarajanagar district.The drive is spearheaded by Dayananda Swami, who has held discussions with senior officials in the district administration to invoke the law and implement the provisions of the Karnataka Prevention of Animal Sacrifice Act (1959), which prohibits animal sacrifice in public places.Dayananda Swami expressed concern that thousands of animals would be slaughtered during the annual jatra festival and hence, the awareness drive among devotees to eschew violence and call for peaceful celebrations.Pamphlets and information brochures are being distributed among the public attending the jatra, which is currently under way near Hanur in Kollegal taluk. The jatra will conclude on January 29 by when more than 50,000 animals would have been sacrificed.Dayananda Swami said convincing people to eschew animal sacrifice will take a long time but the mandal members would persist with it. “We are trying to stop animal sacrifice since the last five years and the number of animals being sacrificed have declined but our efforts will continue till it the tradition is eradicated,” he said. A similar campaign was held to stop animal sacrifice at B.R. Hills.
