Santaram Kadam is an ordinary-looking man who is often seen in Bidari village of Jamkhandi taluk riding on his motorcycle.However, he is not merely a wealthy farmer but one passionate about adopting modern technology in his farm to increase agriculture output.This craze for automation and mechanisation in the field of agriculture has prompted Santaram Kadam to spend unusually large sums of money in his grape and pomegranate farm.Santaram Kadam’s 25-acre farm has two machines imported from Israel for supplying water/fertilizer through drip irrigation system and tractor-driver pesticide spraying machine.“I have spent Rs. 14 lakh on the first machine and I paid Rs. 23 lakh for the second one,” he said, while showing his hi-tech machines installed in his farmhouse.Elaborating on the advantages of the first machine, he said that the computer-operated machine does the job of at least five workers.“All one has to do is to set the time and the quantity of water/fertilizer to be supplied. The rest is done by the machine itself. The machine switches on at the set time and shuts off automatically after supplying the fixed quantity water/fertilizer,” he said.He said that because of this machine, the output has increased by 40 per cent as it supplies water uniformly and only what is needed for each plant.“It also reduces wastage by at least 40 per cent, which turns out to be additional profit for farmers. Though I supply water to only 40 acres of land, the machine can cover 100 acres of land easily,” he said.The second machine, Santaram Kadam said, is used to spray pesticides.“This machine uses only 40 litres of water for spraying pesticide in an acre of land in only 30 minutes. The traditional method requires at least 300 litres of water and takes at least two hours to cover an acre of land,” he said.Admitting that it is not possible for every farmer to spend this much money, he, however, believes that if the government offered at least 50 per cent subsidy on such machines, many farmers would adopt mechanisation in their farms.
