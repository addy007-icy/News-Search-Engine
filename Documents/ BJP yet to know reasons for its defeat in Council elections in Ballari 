Even 48 hours after the results of the Legislative Council election from the local bodies constituency were announced, the district unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to analyse the reasons for the defeat of its candidate.“We have convened a core committee meeting on Sunday to discuss the poll outcome, the reasons for the defeat and also on how to go about in the upcoming elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats. The party’s defeat will also be discussed at the State-level committee meeting on January 4,” Nemiraj Naik, president of the district unit, told presspersons here on Friday.Dismissing allegations that BJP leaders had supported the Congress in the elections, Mr. Naik said, “All our leaders are committed to the party and will not stoop to such a level for money. All our leaders and workers had strived hard to retain the seat. Probably, our candidate lost because the Congress used money power.”Mr. Naik also denied the allegation that there were differences within the party over the selection of candidate. He said that the candidature of Channa Basavanagouda Patil was finalised unanimously by all the leaders, including B. Sriramulu, MP.Mr. Patil said that initially, things appeared to be in his favour, but he could secure only 1,500 votes because the Congress used its money power.
