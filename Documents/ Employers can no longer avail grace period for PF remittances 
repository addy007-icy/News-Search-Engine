Employers, who have been so far entitled to avail of a grace period of five days in addition to the statutory provisions for payment of Provident Fund (PF) contributions and administrative charges, can no longer claim the same with effect from January dues, payable in February, 2016.Addressing a media conference here on Tuesday, Regional PF Commissioner R.K. Sahoo said that employers were required to pay the contributions and administrative charges within 15 days of the close of every month as per the provisions of EPF and MP Act, 1952 under three schemes: Employees’ PF Scheme (EPFS), 1952, Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995, and Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLIS), 1976.
