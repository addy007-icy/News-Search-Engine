Even as meeting of the Ballari City Corporation began, members of the Congress drew the attention of Mayor Nagamma, who was in the chair, that officials were not only showing scant respect to members but were also sidelining Standing Committees.Sudhakar Desai, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Works, said that officials concerned were not attending the meeting convened by him and were also not providing the required information of the works taken up.Other members, including B. Kumaraswamy, Venkataramana, Shashavali, Srinivas Mothkar, Mallanagouda, Parveen among others, endorsed Mr. Desai’s views and sought to know for what reason the committees were constituted.“For anything asked, the officials say that the proposals for developmental works, including those proposed out of the corporation’s own funds, had been sent to Deputy Commissioner. If all the proposals are to be approved by the Deputy Commissioner then why are we here,” they asked. The members also took exception to Arifuddin, Deputy Commissioner, Revenue section, abstaining from attending the general body meetings.They pointed out that discussion of all the issues pertaining to revenue section will have to be deferred for want of the official and urged the Commissioner to summon him to the day’s meeting and only then the subjects on the agenda could be taken up for discussion. Even after an hour, Mr. Arifuddin did not turn up and the commissioner assured the general body that he would submit a report against Mr. Arifuddin.They also protest against Deputy Commissioner, Revenue, abstaining from the meeting
