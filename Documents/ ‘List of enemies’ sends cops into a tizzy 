A background check on Sanjay Sanaria has revealed that he was in debt, had criminal cases registered against him, and a questionable record as a government employee that ended in termination of services. Add to this the differences with his family and some cases where he had lodged complaints against others.Police, in fact, are puzzled over Sanaria’s “long list of enemies”.No clear leads had emerged in the case until Sunday night with Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Parmaditya saying that several teams had been formed to probe all possible angles.The background check also revealed that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had detained Sanaria in 2011 in connection with a corruption and cheating case. It is learnt that this case cost him his job as an upper division clerk (UDC) with the State government.“Since then he started concentrating more on his real estate business, for which he started an office in the locality,” said a police officer.But these businesses involved more than just purchase and sale of properties, or earning a commission on these transfers.“Our probe has revealed that Sanjay would dupe investors of their money by showing a property and claiming to be its owner. There are 10 such cases registered against him. He himself had filed four cases, including the attempt-to-murder case, against his rivals,” said the officer.Another officer said that the house in which the murders took place was disputed property as Sanaria had sold the house to someone, but was delaying possession.Initial probe has narrowed down to property dispute and personal enmity as two key angles.Jyoti’s mother, Swadesh, has purportedly told the police that she last spoke to her daughter around 9 p.m. on Saturday.Relatives, meanwhile, have pointed the needle of suspicion at some local builders with whom Sanaria was involved in disputes over properties.A CCTV installed at the entry point of the lane where the house stands was found to be non-functional.
