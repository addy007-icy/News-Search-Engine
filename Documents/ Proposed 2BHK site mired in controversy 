A controversy is brewing over the tentative selection of a site at Danvaigudem in Khammam rural mandal, falling under the Palair Assembly constituency, for construction of two bedroom houses meant for the beneficiaries of Khammam Assembly constituency.The Revenue officials of Khammam division have tentatively identified three separate sites at Raparthinagar, YSR Colony and Danvaigudem under the Khammam municipal corporation limits for construction of two-bed room houses as part of the TRS governmentâ€™s flagship housing programme.While the sites at Raparthinagar and YSR colony are relatively smaller in size, the site identified at Danvaigudem is spread in 33 acres, sources added.However, the tentative selection of the site at Danvaigudem evoked opposition from various quarters due to its location in Palair Assembly constituency and its proximity to the nearly 40-acre dumping yard.Several former municipal councillors of the Congress party have expressed their resentment over the identification of a site situated in the neighbouring constituency for the houses meant for poor people of Khammam constituency.Congress legislator from Khammam, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, reportedly conveyed his opposition to the move to select a site in the adjoining constituency during a high level meeting on the two bedroom housing scheme held at the Collectorate here on Saturday.Mr. Ajay insisted that all the houses sanctioned under the scheme for Khammam constituency should be constructed in a central locality in the town for the convenience of the beneficiaries of the housing scheme.He suggested that the vacant government land measuring over 45 acres at the NSP camp colony, where several old NSP quarters were recently demolished, could be utilised for construction of two bedroom houses under the scheme.The officials concerned maintained that the proposals will be put forward before the ensuing meeting on the housing scheme to be held under the aegis of Minister for Roads and Buildings T. Nageswara Rao soon.The officials mooted allotment of little over seven acres of land in the NSP camp colony adjoining the bypass for construction of the long awaited new bus stand in the town.
