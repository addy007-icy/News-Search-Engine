Palestinian Ambassador to India, Adnan Abu Alhaija, on Monday, appealed to the international community to support the political efforts of Palestinian administration in establishing an independent, sovereign nation with East Jerusalem as its capital, with borders as defined in 1967.He was in city to inaugurate the India-Palestine Friendship Association on Monday.While the international community had expressed its solidarity with the Palestinian struggle ever since the movement came into being over 50 years ago, it did not succeed in bringing about any dramatic change in the lot of the Palestinians.The international community, which largely restricted its commitment to lip-service, was also responsible for the present state of affairs where large tracts of land had been illegally occupied by Israel, which also perpetrated human rights violations, he said.The Communists around the world and early leaders of the Congress in India stood firmly behind the Palestinian cause. “I hope Indian leadership will continue to extend us its support,” he said.Mr. Abu Alhaija said it was important to outlaw all by-products of Israeli occupation, including commerce and trade.Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly, VS Achuthanandan, in a video message, said that there were attempts on the part of imperialist forces to weaken the Palestinian unity and their struggle for independence.
