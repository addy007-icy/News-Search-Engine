The Supreme Court on Thursday asked 2008 Bangalore blasts case accused Abdul Nazir Maudany to approach the trial court in the next week with his plea to jointly try nine cases registered against him in connection with the serial bomb blasts.A Bench, comprising Justices J. Chelameswar and A.M. Sapre then adjourned the hearing by four weeks. The plea stemmed from a submission made by Maudany’s lawyer, Prashant Bhushan, that 254 witnesses were common to all the nine cases.Karnataka government counsel and senior advocate Raju Ramachandran objected to Mr. Bhushan’s request, saying this should be raised in the trial court concerned.Mr. Bhushan highlighted that Karnataka government had not been able to complete the trial in four months and has now sought another two years’ time. Mr. Ramachandran maintained that the trial was conducted four days every week at the designated court for NIA cases.
