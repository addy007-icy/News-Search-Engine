The last time Rahul Dravid sat in front a packed conference hall at the BCCI headquarters before leaving for an ICC event was back in 2007. The stress was evident on the India captain’s face ahead of the World Cup in the West Indies then, and it was coach Greg Chappell who was the centre of attention.Cut to Tuesday, and it was Dravid’s turn in the spotlight. On the eve of the Indian junior team’s departure for the under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, so relaxed and jovial was Dravid, the coach, that he even cracked jokes.“It seems like captains from Jharkhand do well,” he said, referring to captain Ishan Kishen, sitting by his side, and hastened to add that he had said it in jest.When it came to discussing the prospects of the young Indian side in the biennial event, Dravid was at his articulate best.“My message to them is to focus on actually improving, getting better, seeing this as an opportunity to learn and grow as cricketers,” Dravid said.“They are lucky to get this at a young age. It is just one step in their journey, hopefully, as cricketers. Nobody wants to end up being just an India under-19 cricketer. That is not the aspiration of anybody in that dressing room; not just 15 but each one of the 36 we started with (in the Challenger tournament in October last year) wants to go on and represent India and, hopefully, get to play a senior World Cup for India.”“I always keep reminding them, there are enough examples of people who play India Under-19 but don’t go on to represent India,” he said.“Conversely, there are very good examples of people who have played at this level and then actually gone on to represent India. The important thing you have to go on from here, score runs in first-class cricket, score runs in List-A games and then get the recognition from the selectors.”Despite starting barely three months ago, Dravid said he was satisfied with the team’s preparations.“For the last two years there has not been a lot of Under-19 cricket. The last time the Under-19 team actually played a match together was at the last World Cup, before we reassembled in November and tried to get as many games going as possible,” he said.Dravid said he did not want the pressure of winning to bog down any of the squad members.“This is just one more opportunity to learn, to grow, just to get a little bit more exposure — foreign exposure, to play against teams or boys of their age overseas,” he said.
