BJP leaders Narayansa Bhandge, MLC, and the former MLA Srikanth Kulkarni will head a committee to oversee the preparations to the zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat polls in Bidar.The former district unit president of BJP, Subhash Kallur, announced this at a meeting of party workers on Saturday. He recalled that BJP won most of the seats in the Bidar Zilla Panchayat and five taluk panchayats in the past as the workers had remained united. “We need to realise that no one can defeat us if we put up a united fight,” Mr. Kallur said.He cautioned workers against forces that tended to divide them. The BJP has a majority in most of these elected bodies, though the Congress is in power in the zilla panchayat.The committee would be in charge of resource mobilisation, coordination of campaigns of senior leaders, vehicle movement, working with different language groups, women and other interest groups, media management, keeping accounts and preparing the draft manifesto.Other members of the committee include party district unit president Shivaraj Gandage, Rajkumr Nematabad, Suresh Mashetty, Shivaputra Vaidya, Upendra Deshpande, Ashok Hokrane, Shakuntala Beldale, Dattatreya Tugaonkar, Shivanand Mathalkar, Ramanna Sherikar, Raju Chidri, Rajshekar Nagmurthy, Kushal Patil Gadgi and Baburao Karbari.
