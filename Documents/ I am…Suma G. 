Occupation: Make-up artisteMake-up was something that fascinated me even as a young girl and at 43 I still have the same passion for this art. I do the make-up for dance programmes, especially classical dances.I got hooked to it after I started learning dance at Regatta dance school in the city. Sreevaraham Ravi was our make-up artiste then. Seeing him work, I decided that I wanted to learn how to do it. Actually when I was in class nine I applied the make-up for a bride, one of my relatives! I was quite satisfied with what I did. So, during the summer vacation I did a beautician’s course.I got married after my pre-degree and since I didn’t want to while away my time, I joined Regatta as a dance teacher. However after sometime my focus got shifted to make-up. And I became a make-up artiste. In addition to programmes in the city, I had to travel with students who were participating in dance programmes in other parts of Kerala. I have found that parents are happy if there is a female make-up artiste travelling with their wards for different programmes. After 2000, I started getting work from various schools in the city and many dance schools too.Earlier we used to get the products of just one company for our work. But now there are umpteen brands in the field and this has naturally improved the quality of the make-up. However, I am totally against applying several layers of make-up. The dancer should look graceful on the stage and not heavily made-up. Many make-up artistes cover the original eyebrows and draw another one above that. It is done in such a way that irrespective of the change of emotions, the dancer has the same look on his or her face. I always try to highlight whatever features the dancer has.Of all the classical dances, you have to spend more time dressing up a Kuchipudi dancer, which includes styling the hair and arranging the ornaments. There is a huge difference in the way dance make-up is done in north and south Kerala. According to those in Thrissur, Palakkad and Kozhikode, make-up artistes here don’t apply enough make-up at all!Of late, dancers are spending more money on costumes and ornaments. Heavy and long chains, huge ear-rings and other jewellery is the trend, which I don’t support at all. Even for Thiruvathirakali the dancers apply a lot of make-up and wear a lot of ornaments, which is not pleasing for the eyes. After all, it is the dance that is important.I have started doing bridal make-up again and I juggle it with my make-up work in schools. The youth festival season is quite hectic, be it the sub-district, revenue district or district-level festivals. Temple festivals start by January and I get a lot of work during that time.As I said this is a job that I enjoy to the core and earn me enough to support my family. I stay near Althara Junction, Vazhuthacaud, with my parents, brother and my son, Gopinathan Thampi, a student.There is something fulfilling about doing the job you enjoy. Above all, there aren’t many women doing this job and I am proud that I have gone this far in this male-dominated field.(A weekly column on men and women who make Thiruvananthapuram what it is)
