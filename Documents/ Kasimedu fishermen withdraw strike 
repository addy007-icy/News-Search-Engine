On Tuesday, the fishermen of Kasimedu withdrew their five-day-long strike after the fishermen of Nagapattinam, Cuddalore and Karaikal agreed not to fish in boats using higher horsepower engines off Chennai and Andhra Pradesh coasts.Various fishermen's associations agreed to call off the strike after the State Fisheries Department intervened and got the fishermen from Nagapattinam and Karaikal to agree to their conditions.“The fishermen's associations in those areas have given written acceptances. We have also told them that we will seize boats having higher horsepower engines,” said Vijesh, the leader of an Association.Fishermen of Kasimedu said they were forced to go on strike as their counterparts from Nagapattinam and beyond were fishing off the Andhra Pradesh coast and damaging the nets of fishermen there.
