These six friends have shown that WhatsApp is not just an application for chatting with friends —and that it can be put to better use.The alumni of 1996 batch of St John’s School, Mandaveli, have used the platform to do some social good: they have formed the Child N U trust, to help underprivileged school and college students and stay connected through WhatsApp to guide the activities of the Trust.“I just floated the idea to the group and immediately my friends agreed. We registered the organisation in April this year,” says Shyam Sundar, founder trustee and an advocate by profession.The focus is mainly on poor children. “We will be sponsoring the education of deserving students in the coming academic years,” he adds. Also, they plan to start moral science classes for Corporation and government school students. “We have approached schools to allow us to conduct classes on environment protection and good habits. They like to start the sessions this month,” say the members.A few days ago, the members got together and distributed notebooks and stationery items and geometry boxes for children affected by the floods.“We tied up with NGOs, who helped identify the students from areas such as Jafferkhanpet, Saidapet and Vysarpadi; and we distributed the material to 1,500 children,” adds Shyam, who is also a trustee of Gandhi World Foundation.They also extend support to physically-challenged and visually-impaired students. “We distribute hearing aids, wheelchairs and Braille books to students. Also, the medical expenses of the poor are taken care of,” they say.Volunteers are welcome to join the team. “We are looking for support in any form,” says Shyam. The trust is located at Old Door No.63, New Door No.12, Flat No.3, First Floor, Navarathna Apartments, Second Main Road, R.A. Puram. For details, call 9841136901/9840161106
