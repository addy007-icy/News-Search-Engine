It was a quiet farewell for S. Murugan from the post of Mangaluru City Police Commissioner, which he held for one year, on Sunday. He told The Hindu that policing alone would not help check communalism in the region, but political will was also required to do it. Communal divide was an area of concern in the region, Mr. Murugan said.He came to the office around 10.30 a.m. After receiving the guard of honour, Mr. Murugan exchanged greetings with Deputy Commissioners of Police and police inspectors. He left the office around 11 a.m. after handing over the charge to M. Chandra Sekhar.Mr. Murugan said he was glad to leave Mangaluru with his head held high. Effective action was taken to prevent law and order problems. During his tenure, the police kept the underworld under check.Among the achievements Mr. Murugan listed out included the investigation into the murder of Bajrang Dal activist Harish Poojary in Moodbidri. “We have gone deep into the case to arrest even those who had hatched the conspiracy,” he said.Mr. Murugan said he had the last laugh in connection with the issue of screening of Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol film ‘Dilwale’. Though the police had offered to provide security to cinemas in the light of the threat of protests by Bajrang Dal activists, the owners themselves did not screen the movie. The police were wrongly blamed.The multiplexes in the city were screening the film since Friday. “They [multiplex owners] are now screening the movie and we have given the security. I am happy with this development. I had a last laugh in this issue.”
