housands of devotees visiting Jaanpak dargha to participate in annual Urs-e-Shareef celebrations are deprived of a holy dip as Krishna river and the 400-years-old auspicious well dried up as the Krishna catchment area witnessed poor rainfall during the year. The history of the well, which is called Shafai Bowli (Devuni Bai), runs parallel to that of the dargha. The devotees visiting the dargha during the annual Urs-e-Shareef drink its water and fetch it from the well to have bath since they believe that it contains medicinal value. The pilgrims also bath in Krishna river that flows just two km from the dargha. Temple priest Sayyed Moinuddin says that the well never went dry and that the river used to have some water till January. “We are disappointed since we could not have a holy dip this time,” says Kethavath Ramla Nayak, a devotee from Chivvemula. The local fishermen also used to take the devotees for a ride in the river on their boats earlier when the river was brimming with water.Deepothsavam ritual was performed to mark the end of the celebrations. However, the priest said that the place will witness heavy influx of devotees for the next couple of days. An estimated 4 lakh devotees thronged the temple during the past three days.
