Protests by Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left organisations, demanding the resignation of Excise Minister K. Babu in connection with the bar bribery scandal, marred the inaugural ceremony of the new headquarters of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) at PMG here on Monday.The protest, which ended with the police resorting to a lathicharge and forcibly removing the protesters including legislator V. Sivankutty, began around 10.30 a.m. when Mr. Babu arrived for the inauguration at the new office near the Mascot Hotel.With the protesters, comprising CPI(M), DYFI and All India Democratic Women’s Association activists, waving black flags and squatting on the road to prevent the Minister from entering the venue, the Minister was taken into the venue through another route that passed through the compound of the Mascot Hotel.Earlier, inaugurating the new headquarters, Mr. Babu said the government’s approach was to reduce availability of liquor and to strengthen its awareness campaign against alcoholism.The nine-storied new office complex, constructed at a cost of Rs.14.43 crore, is on a 28.24-cent plot with the BSNL Civil Wing taking care of the construction.
