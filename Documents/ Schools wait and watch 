: Even as the Delhi government came down heavily on private schools on the issue of nursery admission, and ordered them to scrap the management quota and “discriminatory” admission criterion, schools have adopted a cautious approach in reacting to the government’s decision.While some schools said they will follow the government order, others said that it is an attack on their “autonomy”. Various private associations of schools have also reacted against the government decision to scrap management quota, calling it a “contempt of court” as the matter is sub-judice.Reacting to the government decision, D.K. Bedi, principal of Apeejay Pitampura, said: “Our school has always followed government decisions and will abide by this decision as well.”Principal of Ahlcon International Schools, Ashok Pandey, said: “Trying to bring any order at this stage is surprising especially when the admissions have already begun as it will create further confusion for parents. Further, the government’s move is a direct intervention in autonomy, which is granted to schools by the Constitution.”Amity International and Delhi Public School in R.K. Puram refused to comment on the issue, saying they have not received the circular so far.The school associations, which had moved court in 2014 after Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung had notified the scrapping of quota then, claimed the matter is still pending and hence the announcement amounts to “contempt of court”.There was a judgement by a single bench of High Court granting autonomy to schools for deciding quotas. The government had sought a stay before a double bench, and the matter is still pending in court.“Such an announcement at this stage, when the matter is sub-judice amounts to contempt of court,” said a member of the Action Committee for Unaided Private Schools, which has 400 schools registered with it.The govt's move is a direct intervention in our autonomy, which is granted to schools by the ConstitutionAshok Pandey,Principal of AhlconInternational Schools
