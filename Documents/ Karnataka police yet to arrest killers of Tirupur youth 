For M. Rathinasamy (62), a farmer from Mathamputhur near here, the wait to know the killers of his son Karthik Vishnu soon after one of the New Year day celebrations at a Bengaluru city hotel in 2013 continues.It was on January 1, 2013, Karthik Vishnu, a Tirupur-based computer engineer, and an alumnus of Sainik School, Amaravathinagar, was stabbed to death soon after he came out of the hotel.Vishnu sustained a stab right in the heart.“Till now, the police could not track or get any clues of the actual culprits though they have questioned many. Since the investigation has been going tardy, I moved a writ petition in Karnataka High Court more than a year ago seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the murder. The petition is yet to be disposed of as Karnataka police have been seeking more time to file their version which caused the delays,” said Mr. Rathinasamy.He sounded hopeful that the court would be pronouncing the verdict very soon as the time sought by the police for their reply was over. Vishnu, who worked as a freelance computer engineer from his home here after completion of B.E studies, went to Bengaluru for a professional assignment.He took part in the New Year celebrations along with seven friends, many of whom said to be Sainik School alumni.R. Sekar, brother-in-law of the deceased, said the murder happened between 1.15 a.m. and 1.45 a.m. on the said New Year day outside the hotel.The video footage at the hotel where Vishnu and his friends went showed that they were dancing without any untoward incident till the end of the programme. So, something went wrong after he came out which still remains a mystery, said his relatives.
