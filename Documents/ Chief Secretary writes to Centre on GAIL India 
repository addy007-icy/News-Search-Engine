Concerned about the sluggish progress of GAIL India’s project for a natural gas pipeline passing through seven districts in the State, Chief Secretary Jiji Thomson has now accused the agency of ‘dragging its feet’ on the project.In a strongly-worded letter to Union Petroleum Secretary Kapil Dev Tripathi on January 5, Mr. Thomson made no bones about his deep dismay and shock over the ‘callous attitude’ of GAIL India in implementing the project — which has been marred by a series of delays on several counts, including people’s protest, litigation and land acquisition issues. He said the State had taken several proactive measures, including constituting high-level nodal teams headed by an officer in the rank of Principal Secretary “to provide ground support.”However, GAIL India “did not utilise the opportunity and missed the June-August window that was created for them to finish the survey work… In addition to the regular revenue team comprising village officials and Tahsildars, additional survey equipment and manpower were provided by the Commissioner of Land Survey (sic),” he wrote castigating GAIL India for neither mobilising manpower nor lowering into the duct 31 km of welded pipe kept at various locations.“Even now, the progress of daily survey is abysmally low.”While December 1 was the targeted date to complete the survey across the seven districts, only 70 per cent of work had been done, he pointed out.Mr. Thomson attributed the delay in work in Malappuram and Kozhikode districts to troubles fomented by “some fundamentalist groups,” but said laying of pipe elsewhere could be carried out even as the survey was under way in these districts.Decks cleared“The entire stretch for Kochi-Palakkad to Coimbatore is ready. So is the stretch from Mangalore to Kannur and from Kochi till Malappuram. Strategically speaking, we should without any delay start laying of pipeline wherever panchnama work is completed and this would put pressure on the other two districts — Malappuram and Kozhikode — to follow suit. On a positive note, in Malappuram and Kozhikode, decks are cleared for survey work and 22 plus km has been already completed (sic).”Continued inactionMaintaining that continued inaction would inordinately delay the project in view of the Assembly elections mid-year, he appealed to Mr. Tripathi to intervene for accelerated implementation of the project.GAIL India has missed the deadline set for themto finish thesurvey work.
