Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has expressed total confidence that there will not be any crack in the United Democratic Front (UDF) armour and pointers from the Left Democratic Front (LDF) leadership have only brought out their lack of confidence and a rethink on their earlier stance on development issues.Speaking to media persons on the sidelines of a meeting called to announce the dedication of K.R. Narayanan National Institute of Visual Science and Arts at Thekumthala off Kottayam on Sunday, Mr. Chandy said the recent overtures to UDF constituents by LDF leadership only showed their lack of confidence to face the ensuing elections.JD(U) issueWhen asked about the open invitation to Janata Dal (U) leader M.P. Veerndrakumar from CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan at a book releasing ceremony, the Chief Minister said this only showed that the CPI(M) was on a course correction path.The UDF would face the election as one unit, he said.According to him, the comments made by Mr. Vijayan on Vizhinjam port clearly points out that they have endorsed the UDF policy on the issue.‘‘The LDF had alleged Rs.6,000 crore corruption regarding Vizhinjam. Since the UDF was confident, we did not heed to such allegations and moved ahead. Now they have endorsed our stance,’’ he said. According to Mr. Chandy, his government would move ahead only if the step they had taken was in the right direction and would benefit the State, he said.To another question, Mr. Chandy said the interaction between UDF coalition leaders and AICC president Sonia Gandhi would only help to strengthen the front. There was nothing new in UDF leaders meeting the AICC president, he said.
