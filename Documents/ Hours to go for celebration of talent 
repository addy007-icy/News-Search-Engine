Hectic preparations are on for the 56th State school arts festival that will begin here on Tuesday.At the Putharikandam grounds, work was under way even on Sunday night to get the stage and pandal ready in time to meet the deadline of Monday afternoon.

The grounds had been flattened to make it festival-ready, stage and pandal committee convener Nisam Chithara said.The rehearsal of the welcome song by 56 teachers and the audiovisual choreography by students were also held at the grounds in the afternoon. Another practice session would be held at 1 p.m. on Monday.The festival flag will be hoisted at the grounds at 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday. Director of Public Instruction M.S.

Prasanth at 11.30 a.m. on Monday. Chief chef Pazhayidam Mohanan Namboodiri will be present, food committee convener Vattappara Anilkumar said. Provisions had been stocked, and vegetables would be purchased on Monday, he said. Light and sound facilities at all venues but for the Putharikandam grounds are ready, light and sound committee convener Mohankumar B. said. The arrangements at the main venue will be over on Monday, he said.
