Karunamurthy, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Meenpidi Thozhirsanga Koottamaippu (CITU), the family members presented a common petition to the Collector S. Natarajan here on Monday and urged him to secure the release of the fishermen at the earliest.The family members from various fishing hamlets in Kilakarai region said the fishermen went to Dubai in two batches in April and June last year on contract fishing and were working in a fish company owned by an ‘Arabi’ (United Arab Emirates national).The fishermen, along with fishermen from Kanniyakumari district, were fishing on the high seas when they were arrested by the Iran navy on charges of trespassing into their waters and detained in an island with their five trawlers, they said.A Gomathi, wife of Arumugam, one of the 11 fishermen, said her husband spoke to her on Sunday night and said they were detained in the island and made to fend for themselves.
