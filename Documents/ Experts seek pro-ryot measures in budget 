Underlining the need for pro-farmer initiatives in the upcoming 2016-17 Union budget, farmer leaders, experts and agricultural economists came up with a set of demands, during a meeting organised by Federation of Farmers Association (FFA), here on Saturday.The meeting was held to elicit suggestions from the beneficiaries and forward the same as proposals in the Union budget.The participants not only demanded for a 30-40 per cent hike in allocation of funds, but also urged the Central to recognise agriculture as an industry and extend the benefits offered to other sectors for its comprehensive development.They also sought adequate funds for increasing storage facilities to safeguard farm produces.Besides this, the members also called upon the government for interest-free loans (including education loans), total compensation for crops destroyed in natural calamities and remedial measures for problems faced by farmers when it comes to bank loans.
