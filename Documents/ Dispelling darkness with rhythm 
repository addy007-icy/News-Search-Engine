Mahesh Kumar likes to look at the brighter side of life.That life itself is a continuing spell of darkness except for some very blurred images hasn’t doused his spirit to live.And this 35-year-old visually challenged from Puthu Vype insists on living a life with his head held high and not out of the society’s sympathy.That drove him to conquer his disability and master multiple instruments, including udukku and chenda. He is now a regular feature in melams at temple fests in Ernakulam and neighbouring districts. His inspirational life has also been made into a short film by the name ‘B Positive’.Before the near complete blindness forced him out of school at standard seven, Mahesh had his first spell of training under a guru in his neighbourhood. The result was almost instant as he emerged winner in chenda and first runner-up in mridangam in the district youth fest.He had two more brief spells of training before he became a veteran performer in the festival circuit. Mahesh now trains about ten youngsters for a nominal fee.Once the festival season is over, he gets busy with a variety of odd jobs. He dons the roles of a lottery seller and fish vendor. “I want to earn my living and does not want to be a burden on anyone,” says Mahesh.Introspection timeIt seems to be introspection time for engineers and institutions that churn them out.India’s ‘metro man’ E. Sreedharan had some words of advice for them, at the NIT-Calicut Alumni Association (NITCAA) Day celebrations held in Kochi two days ago. Speaking of fall in integrity, competency, will power, commitment and discipline among engineers, he said that engineers must largely be blamed for the bad image the society has about them.Citing his own experiences, he said that only strong willed and committed engineers can ward off undesirable influences.M.P.
