Minister for Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NoRKA) K.C. Joseph has described as unfortunate the Centre’s decision to cancel the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas 2016 observance. The Minister, in a statement here on Saturday, said that the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas was being observed every year since 2003 to commemorate the return of Mahatma Gandhi from South Africa in 1915. Once the NDA government took over, it cut short the observance to once in two years, and has now completely scrapped it. The move smacked of disrespect to Gandhiji and lack of concern for NRIs, he said. He demanded that the government reconsider the decision.— Special Correspondent
