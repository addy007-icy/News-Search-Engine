The Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) will hold meetings in all 29 villages in the capital region to create awareness about the detailed master plan, which was released on December 26.The first meeting will be held at Thullur on January 12, revenue officials said.Though no official schedule has been released so far, they added that CRDA personnel were making arrangements such as facilities for power-point presentations and display of the capital city map in all villages.For the record, an introductory meeting organised on January 7 was marred by protests by a section of farmers who demanded that they be allotted developed plots closer to their villages. A section of farmers had also shared their anxiety over the proposed express highway, which, they said, could slice through residential and commercial spaces.CRDA Commissioner N. Srikanth, Guntur Collector Kantilal Dande and Joint Collector Ch. Sridhar are expected attend the meetings which would be spread over a fortnight.
