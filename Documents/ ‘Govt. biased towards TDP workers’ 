Accusing the State government of being partial towards the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) workers while implementing welfare programmes, former Union Minister M.M. Pallam Raju on Tuesday recalled that the Congress had extended welfare schemes to all eligible people, notwithstanding their political affiliations.Addressing the District Congress Committee meting held at the party office here, Mr. Pallam Raju said that in the name of Janmabhoomi Committees, the government gave powers to the TDP cadre.“Now, the committees are exercising their powers to benefit only party workers irrespective,” he observed. He added that people were unhappy with the TDP and expressed hope that they would vote the Congress to power in the next elections.DCC president Kandula Durgesh said what Congress had said about the Pattiseema lift irrigation project had come true.
