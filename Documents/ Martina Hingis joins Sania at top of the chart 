It was just a question of time to get that No.1 ranking.“I’m so happy for her that 16 years later she’s become No.1 again!” Mirza, who first rose to No.1 last April, commented. “But regardless of what the ranking was, we were the No.1 team in the world. I’m so happy that we’re together now not just as the No.1 team, but as individuals as well.”
