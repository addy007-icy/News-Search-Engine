Among those, who applied for the post include N. Ramaswamy (Biotechnology), K. Sitarama Rao (Public Administration), V. Ravinder and G. Dayakar (Chemistry), Manoja (Economics), G. Rameswaram (Public Administor), Om Prakash (Commerce), G. Damodar and K. Purushottam (English).Prof. K.

His name made rounds when Prof T. Papi Reddy was selected as Chairman of Higher Education Council.As the selection of vice-chancellors was kept pending, he had to wait.However, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who maintained that whoever who worked for the movement would get an opportunity in government may not go just by that criteria in selecting vice-chancellors to nine universities in the State.He was reportedly going by the academic excellence and paper publications of teachers for the coveted post.Speaking to The Hindu, associate professor of English and Sahitya Akademi prize-winner for translation work, K. Damodar Rao said Chief Minister was right in going by theacademic excellence and research work of teachers.“The selection will be easy by the criteria. The institutions will get genuine and scholarly persons as heads which is beneficial to student community and society at large,” heopined.
