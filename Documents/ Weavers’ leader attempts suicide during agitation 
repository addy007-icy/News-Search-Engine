The agitation by weavers to press for their long-pending demands here on Saturday witnessed some anxious moments as the vice-president of their association attempted to commit suicide.However, other weavers and police personnel present at the agitation venue thwarted his attempt by immediately rushing to his side and removed the rope with which he was trying to hang himself.The incident happened in front of the head office of the Karnataka Handloom Development Corporation (KHDC) located at Vidyanagar during the agitation held by members of the ‘Akhila Karnataka Kaimagga Nekarara Sangha’ (All Karnataka Handloom Weavers Association).The weavers were staging a symbolic agitation protesting against the apathy of the Textile Minister, Baburao Chinchanasur, in solving their problem and blamed him for their plight.They said that because of the Minister’s “inefficiency and irresponsibility,” KHDC had lost Rs. 10 crore in the ‘Madilu’ kit scheme imbroglio in the last fiscal and sought action against the Minister. The weavers also demanded a hike of 30 per cent in their wages, establishment of a common weaving facility centre in Hubballi and allotment of work sheds for the weavers.The protesting weavers had tied a rope to a beam on the first floor of the head office building, to suggest symbolically that they would be forced to commit suicide if no remedial measures were taken to help the weavers. Vice-President of the Association N.J. Malawade who made an emotional speech said that despite assurances, nothing had improved for the weavers.And even as others were listening to him, he rushed for the rope and tried to hang himself. As others watched anxiously, those standing close to him rushed towards him along with the police in plain clothes and foiled his bid. Subsequently he was given water and then taken away from the venue.
