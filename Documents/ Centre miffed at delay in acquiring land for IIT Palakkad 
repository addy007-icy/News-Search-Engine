Slow progress of land acquisition initiatives launched by the State government in Pudussery West village here for setting up the permanent campus of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Palakkad, has invited the displeasure of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development.As per the earlier plan, the State was to hand over 500 acres of land close to the Kanjikode industrial belt in Pudussery West to the Ministry by December 31.On its part, the Union Ministry had promised to start the construction work in January itself and to complete it within three years. A sum of Rs.1,000 crore was earmarked for the first phase of construction.Though the deadline has lapsed, the State government is yet to acquire about 360 acres of private land because of the delaying tactics of real estate mafia.Now, the district authorities are threatening land owners that indentified land would be taken over using provisions of the Land Acquisition Act if the owners refused to accept the market price fixed by the State government.It was at a recent high level meeting in New Delhi that the HRD Ministry expressed its displeasure over the slow progress in land acquisition. Land acquisition for new IITs in Telengana, Jammu and Kashmir and Karnataka have already been completed, the officials told State government representatives who attended the meeting. The Centre has directed the State to complete land acquisition by January-end.Of the remaining 140 acres, only those under the State government and the local panchayats can be acquired easily.About 43 acres of land has been identified as forest land and its transfer requires permission from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests.The State government is required to find 86 acres of land elsewhere to hand over to the Forest Department for afforestation.Though the Revenue Department has been asked to find land in Attappady at a price of Rs.5,000 per cent, officials said getting fertile land close to forest areas in Attappady at the meagre rate was difficult.Three more monthsAccording to sources, the government is in need of at least three more months to complete the formalities to acquire land for the IIT. Formal handing over will take at least six more months.At present, the IIT functions from its temporary campus at Ahalya Group of Institutions in Kozhipara near Walayar.
