A PIL petition has been moved before the Madras High Court alleging irregularities in sand quarrying in the districts of Karur, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam. The PIL sought the court to direct the authorities concerned to initiate action to control illegal quarrying in the districts.When the plea moved by R. Fathima came up for hearing before the First Bench comprising Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M. Sathyanarayanan, the Bench directed the High Court Registry to verify whether any other connected petitions are pending before the Madurai Bench or the Principal Bench in Madras relating to the subject matter and to submit a report.The petitioner in her PIL plea alleged that sand was being quarried in these six districts above the prescribed limits illegally. “Particularly in Cauvery and Kollidam rivers, over 80 per cent of sand quarried is above the prescribed limit,” the petitioner alleged.Claiming that the authorities failed to take action on a representation made by her regarding the issue on November 1, 2015, the petitioner wanted the court to direct the officials to initiate immediate action.The PIL plea has been posted to March 1 for further hearing.
