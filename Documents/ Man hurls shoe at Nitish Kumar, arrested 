A man hurled a shoe at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar when he was addressing a function at his native Bakhtiyarpur in Patna on Thursday.The man, said to be in an inebriated condition, was apparently unhappy with the Chief Minister’s decision to ban liquor in the State from April 1.The shoe, however, fell short of the dais. Mr. Kumar was addressing a function organised on the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Shilbhadra Yaji. The former Chief Minister of Haryana Bhupendra Singh Hooda was present on the dais. The man identified as Pravesh Kumar Rai was later arrested, said Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Manu Maharaj.Mr. Nitish Kumar had just begun his address and was reiterating his commitment to the implementation of a total ban on liquor when the man hurled the shoe. The security personnel immediately took him into custody, but Mr. Kumar was heard saying “tum sharab pita hai kya? [do you drink liquor?]…chhod do [leave him].” He was, later, taken to the Bakhtiyarpur police station for further interrogation.
