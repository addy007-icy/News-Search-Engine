The Bombay High Court on Thursday rejected the State government's plea to hold the Maharashtra night of "Make in India Week" at Girgaum Chowpatty.A Division Bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice C v Bhadang was hearing an application filed by the State on January 21 to seek permission to hold the cultural function at Chowpatty on February 14, 2016.Advocate General Sheehari Aney, appearing for the State submitted a chart of the function that slotted space for a stage, green rooms, music system and washrooms and said that it would take up space upto 2,00,000 sq ft.The court explained, so many structures on the beach and said that allowing permission to hold this function will open gates for private parties as well.Mr. Aney said the function will only be held for four hours in the evening and the beach will be open for the public at large. He added since Prime Ministers and 57 foreign dignatries will be present it will be nice to host the function at the attractive skyline of Marine drive.The court then said, (we are) not concerned about how to impress people but asked why should the function be organised at the beach?The AG also said that the beach was used by leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and others for holding public meetings and immersion of idols.The Bench was informed about an order passed by HC in 2011 had granted permission to the State to hold the 1st and last day of a function to celebrate 50 years of Statehood at Girgaum Chowpatty.The court said guidelines were made by a high powered committee that has mentioned occassions when the beach can be used including Ram Leela and immersion of Ganesh and Durga idols.The court on Thursday said except activites mentioned no other activities should be held and the beach will always be open for the public. The court also recorded that an exception was made to celebrate Statehood and that "Make in India" cannot be held solemn.The court further said presence of foreign dignatries does not make a case for treating this at par with a function to celebrate Statehood and rejected the plea.The 'Make in India' initiative is aimed at making India a global manufacturing hub and create millions of jobs. The entire Week is organised to promote India as an investment destination and increase its share in global foreign direct investment
