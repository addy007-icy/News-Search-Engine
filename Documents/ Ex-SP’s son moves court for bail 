Nikhil Balachandran, 23, son of retired Superintendent of Police (SP) K.B. Balachandran and an accused in a criminal case, who recently gave the slip to the chasing Thiruvananthapuram police, has approached the Kerala High Court with a plea for an anticipatory bail.In his petition filed on Tuesday, he said that he had been implicated as accused in a criminal case registered by the Museum Police station for offences punishable under sections 452, 506 and section 34 of Indian Penal Code read with section 27 of the Arms Act. The case was registered on the complaint of Beena Chandy of Pandits Colony, Thiruvananthapuram.According to the petitioner, Beena Chandy had not written the petitioner’s name in her complaint.But the Museum Police due to influence of some police officers who were inimical to his father, a retired IPS officer, had alleged that the petitioner was involved in the crime.The police came on December 27 to his house looking for him. As the petitioner was not at home, the police forcefully broke open the front doors of his house, despite the plea of the petitioner’s mother and sister.The police had created a “fearful atmosphere by demolishing the window panel and doors” of the house. They had informed the police that the petitioner was on a pilgrimage trip to Sabarimala and Mookambika. Refusing to heed their words, the police had entered the house as if they were hunting for a terrorist or a big criminal.If the petitioner was involved, the police should have given a written notice to the petitioner’s father or any of the petitioner’s family members under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code requiring the petitioner’s presence at the police station. He had not committed any offence as alleged by the police. The police under influence of the enemies of his father were hunting the petitioner and trying to implicate the petitioner and petitioner’s father in cases involving non-bailable offences. The intention of the police was to arrest the petitioner in order to humiliate him and his father.The petitioner reasonably apprehends that he would be arrested and detained illegally at the instance of a senior police officer who is in inimical terms with the father of the petitioner.Says police is under influence of the enemies of his father, a retiredIPS officer
