The Dammapeta police arrested two members of an inter-State cricket betting racket on Wednesday.The arrested persons were B. N. Reddy of Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh and Bharath of Sattupalli in Khammam district of Telangana, according to police sources.The arrests were made based on a complaint filed by M Naresh, a B.Tech graduate of Naidupeta, who had reportedly lost one of his kidneys after falling prey to a gang involved in kidney transplantation racket, against the duo.The duo had allegedly duped Naresh by collecting huge amount from the latter during his stay in Hyderabad in search of a job last year. Naresh had landed in a financial crisis after being allegedly exploited by the duo and subsequently fell prey to a different gang involved in kidney racket, sources added.The police, however, maintained that the arrested had no role in kidney transplantation racket.Meanwhile, the police stepped up the investigation into the kidney racket by evaluating the call data of Naresh.
