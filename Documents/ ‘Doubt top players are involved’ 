Responding to the reports of match-fixing in tennis, India Davis cup team captain Anand Amritraj on Saturday said he believed that the sport’s top players would not have indulged in it.“I have a hard time believing that it’s the top players. Lower-ranked players, like say, outside the top 100 or 150 may have resorted to match-fixing.”He said that the large amount of money involved in the sport now has made it more vulnerable to the practice. “There was no match-fixing during my time because there was lesser money involved in the sport than how it is like now.”The 63-year-old felt that it’s a hard task to monitor the players on a regular basis. “The thing with tennis is that it’s difficult to constantly monitor and even if it’s done, it’s very hard to say whether a player is being genuine or not.”
