The hepatitis A virus is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water or through direct contact with an infectious person. The first symptoms of the disease are fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle pains, nausea and low-grade fever. When the disease matures signs of liver problems can show up and these include dark urine, light-coloured bowel movements, yellow skin (jaundice), yellowing of the sclera, stomach pain and itchy skin. Though hepatitis A is a self-limiting viral disease, it causes significant morbidity. Even those cured will a take a couple of months to recover fully. Under favourable conditions the virus may survive in the environment for months. In areas with very poor sanitary conditions, most children have been found to be infected with the virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience noticeable symptoms, but develop lifelong immunity. So outbreaks of hepatitis A are uncommon in areas with very poor sanitation because older children and adults are generally immune. But in Kerala with comparatively better sanitation and better standards of living, children often escape infection. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions led to a higher susceptibility in older age groups and higher disease rates, as infections occur in adolescents and adults. Studies in this backdrop show that huge outbreaks of hepatitis A have to be expected in the State in coming years.
