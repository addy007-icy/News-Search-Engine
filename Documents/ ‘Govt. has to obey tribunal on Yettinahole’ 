It is for the State government to follow orders of the National Green Tribunal and not carry out work relating to the Yettinahole project till they get mandatory clearances, said Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, here on Wednesday.Talking to presspersons, Mr. Kateel said that the tribunal had passed orders restraining the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited from carrying the work on a petition by green activists.“If the reports that the KNNL is going ahead with the work are true then it shows that the government has no regard for the tribunal’s orders. The green activists would definitely bring this to the notice of the tribunal,” he said. Mr. Kateel said that the Regional Empowered Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests has recently given clearance to carrying out first phase of work in the private land in Sakaleshpur. “This clearance has been given on the claim by the KNNL that the project was for drawing flood water.”Mr. Kateel said that the Ministry was yet to give clearance for use of forest land for the project.He said activists from Chikkaballapur and Kolar are convinced that they are not getting water from the project for which government was spending Rs. 13,000 crore.
