The first day of the odd-even plan had seen lax police deployment at Delhiâ€™s border points with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which remain largely unchecked. Monday, the first working day after a long New-Year weekend, however, was a completely different story.Not only most border checkpoints saw heavy deployment of traffic police personnel, senior police officers and officials of Delhi government's revenue department oversaw arrangements and prosecution of violators.The police put up barricades on the Delhi-Gurgaon border for the first time since the odd-even plan came into force on January 1. More than a dozen traffic policemen kept a hawk-eyed vigil on the service lane of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from 8 am, flagging down vehicles and issuing challans to violators. Realising soon that not many vehicles were taking the service lane, the traffic police shifted the barricades to the expressway signalling to stop the vehicles coming from Gurgaon.Around noon, Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Muktesh Chander, along with other senior officers, reached the spot to oversee the challaning process. Mr. Chander himself signalled a couple of vehicles to stop and issued challans.The barricades on the expressway, however, led to traffic snarls which extended up to IFFCO Chowk in the evening.The carriageway that sees traffic coming from Ghaziabad was manned by six traffic policemen, while the parallel road for Ghaziabad-bound traffic was manned by two traffic policemen, two Delhi Police personnel, apart from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Seemapuri, Subhash Chand, who himself signed all the challans.Seeing the heavy police presence, many violators coming from Ghaziabad tried to take a a U-turn near the Apsara border. One team of traffic policemen was then posted closer to the U-turn.The Delhi-UP border between Anand Vihar and Kaushambi saw the deployment of only three traffic policemen and a couple of civil defence volunteers holding placards for awareness. However, a bigger team of traffic policemen were posted beneath the flyover leading towards Ghazipur, as all vehicles coming from Ghaziabad have to drive towards that side to enter Delhi.
