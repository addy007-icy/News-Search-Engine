The faithful at the Cooperage football ground may have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of football dished out by the two teams — Mumbai FC and Goa’s Salgaocar Sports Club — in their I-league match on Sunday.But first the energetic and enterprising Japanese captain of the home team, Taisuke Matsugae, and his band of players and thereafter some meticulous undertaking by the visitors ensured that the spectators got their money’s worth and a best weekend holiday. Mumbai FC won 2-1.For straightforward reasons the 33-year-old midfielder, Taisuke was the toast of the evening, scoring the first goal of the season for his side with a long range pile-driver in the 37th minute and thereafter back-passing for Sushil Kumar Singh to hit home the second in the 48th that clinched the first big points for the home team.Always a threat, Salgoacar’s Jackichand Singh found the net in the 66th minute to raise hopes of a dramatic finish. A weary and nervous Mumbai FC faltered many times in the second half, but it managed to hold on to the one-goal lead and when the play came to an end after three minutes of added-on time, there was much relief and joy in the home team’s ranks and supporters.Although coach Khalid Jamil had gone overboard to say that he would not be disappointed with a drawn result, his charges believed otherwise. The presence of Japan’s Ryuki Kozawa appeared to have injected a massive dose of hustle and bustle in the home team’s front line. With the likes of Izumi Arata and Sushil Kumar looking to capitalise on the fine work done by Jayesh Rane and Liberian Eric Brown on the wings, the emphasis was heavy on attack.Right from the start there were a number of shots directed at the goal that kept the Salgaocar goalkeeper and captain Karanjit Singh watchful and busy inside the penalty box. Attention was riveted on Kozawa who made his I-League debut, but the man who took centre-stage was Taisuke.He was the livewire and completely caught the rivals by surprise eight minutes from half-time. A yellow card for committing a foul did not deter him from going full throttle to add to the pressure sustained by Rane, Brown, Arata, Sushil Kumar and Kozawa.There was a sort of scuffle after Taisuke put his side ahead, and also a strong riposte from the Goan side in the last five minutes of the first session. The match lifted itself to a level of a true contest in the second half with the individual brilliance of Darryl Duffy and clever movement by Jackichand, Calvin Mbarga and defender Gurjinder Singh taking long range shots on and off.Mumbai FC impressed with its short passing and body feints; maybe Brown and Sushil Kumar overdid, but it went down well with the 2500 odd spectators. There were a number of free-kicks that raised the excitement quotient, and Mumbai FC gasped when substitute Manandeep Singh’s shot skimmed over the cross bar in the first minute of the add-on time.The result: Mumbai FC 2 (Taisuke 37, Sushil Kumar 48) bt Salgaocar SC 1 (Jackichand Singh 66).
