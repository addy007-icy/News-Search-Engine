A team from the Forest Department reached the spot and rescued the crocodile.‘‘It is a fresh water crocodile and an eight-member team struggled hard to handle it and tie its snout,’’ said K.R. Krishnadas, assistant wild life warden, WWS, who led the operation. It would be released in its natural habitat, he said. This is the first time that a crocodile has been sighted in the area.
