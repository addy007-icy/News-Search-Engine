The Andhra Pradesh Vyavasaya Karmika Sangam demanded that the government cancel Janmabhoomi Committees and provide works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in villages.Addressing newsmen here on Saturday, sangam State general secretary V. Venkateswarlu said in all 83,09,706 job cards were there in the State. In 2013-14, works were provided to 34,28,146 card holders by spending Rs. 1,986 crore and during 2014-15, works were provided to 33,12,115 card holders and only Rs. 1,878 crore was spent.Even as the government was announcing drought in the State, the workdays were decreasing and many families were rendered jobless.But, the works were being allotted to TDP leaders and activists who were enrolled in Janmabhoomi Committees and Neeru-Chettu programme.Though the State government declared drought in 359 mandals and assured to provide works for 150 days, the Centre had announced that only 196 mandals were identified as drought-hit in the State.“During a survey conducted by the AP Vyasavaya Karmika Sangam it was observed that large-scale irregularities have taken place and public money was misused. The Sangam will organise a ‘Chalo Assembly’ during the ensuing Budget Sessions, if works are not provided to all the card holders in the State and cancel Janmabhoomi Committees,” Mr. Venkateswarlu warned.Some thousands of agriculture labourers lost their livelihood in Krishna and Guntur districts due to destroying of crops and fertile lands on the pretext of setting up capital. But, the government has not announced any alternative livelihood for them, said Upadimetla Sangam State secretary T. Kranthi Kiran.Mr. Venkateswarlu demanded that the government enrol the activists from AP Vyavasaya Karmika Sangam, social service organisations and village sarpanches in the State council, and provide 200 workdays in a year in drought mandals in the State.Vyavasaya Karmika Sangam says the workdays are coming downin the State
