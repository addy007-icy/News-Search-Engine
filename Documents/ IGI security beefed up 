Such calls are technically called non-specific calls and this particular one originated from an international number. It is also suspected to be executed through the Internet,” DCP (IGI Airport) D K Gupta said.“The caller, whom we are trying to trace for details, called up and said that a man who is heading for Germany from IGI will do something big in Delhi before he leaves. He did not disclose any further details,” Mr. Gupta added.Yesterday, security agencies went into a tizzy after the police control room received a call about a bomb at the Parliament premises but it turned to be hoax.
