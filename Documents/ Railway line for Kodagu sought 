Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, has urged Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, to include the Mysuru-Kushalnagar-Madikeri new railway line in this yearâ€™s budget. In a letter to Mr. Prabhu, the MP has said that Kodagu district lacked rail connectivity and it was a long-pending demand of the people. He said the survey work up to Madikeri has been completed and the consolidated report would be submitted to the Railway Board by the end of this month. He has also sought a road over bridge (ROB) at level crossing number 3 in Hassan to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles.
