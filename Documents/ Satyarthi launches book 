Decades after he questioned the idea of child labour, Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi launched his book “ Azad Bachpan Ki Or ” recently, dedicated to all the child labourers he has come across so far.The book is a culmination of Mr. Satyarthi’s long-drawn march against the rights of children employed in various odd jobs. It comprises articles, pamphlets and other writings on the subject.Tracing Mr. Satyarthi’s journey from 1981 onwards when he first rescued a girl from traffickers, the book narrates how he started working towards protecting children since then. In fact, the activist pointed out that some of his articles even “question religious beliefs and dogmas” that fall silent on “malpractices like begging”.Throughout the course of his sustained attack on child-traffickers, Mr. Satyarthi himself has been at the centre of many assaults. He recounts an incident when his residence was surrounded by a violent group that intended to kill him. “Such threats allowed me to intensify my attacks on those who deprive children of their basic rights,” said Mr. Satyarthi.Arguing that all government departments must work in cohesion to facilitate the development of children from deprived sections, Mr. Satyarthi underlined that “only 0.4 per cent of India’s GDP is spent on the welfare of children.”He also attempted to burst the popular notion that confuses poverty with an increasing trend in favour of child labour. “Employing children as labourers is an easy way out as they cannot protest or join a union. The parents of such children remain unemployed as children alone comprise an unaccounted and unregulated workforce that needs no care,” said Mr. Satyarthi.(The author is an intern with The Hindu )
