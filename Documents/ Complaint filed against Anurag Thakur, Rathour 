And (he was) reappointed in Nov. 2015 when Mr Thakur was the Honorary Secretary of BCCI. It is found that Mr Rathour &/or his family members and Mr. Thakur &/or his family members are directors in various companies,” he added.Gunde has also attached the details of the various companies. The Hindu is in possession of all the documents.The documents reveal that Rathour’s relative, Raj Kumar Rathour, has been a director of Sant Online Systems Pvt Ltd since April 16, 2001. Thakur is managing director of the said company since November 10, 2000.TGR Industries Pvt Ltd is another company whose ownership details Gunde has cited in his complaint. Rathour is a director of this company since Oct. 29, 2011. Thakur is a former director of this company.“It is clear that both these administrators are connected through business commercial relationship that either of them failed to disclose. It is a clear case of conflict of interest,” Gunde writes.Thakur and Rathour are cousins. Thakur said, “The relationship between my family and Vikram’s goes back to the previous generation. It is more than 40 years old and it has nothing to do with cricket. People with (ulterior) motives are filing these mischievous complaints just because they have got a platform.”
