Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala has asked the Director General of Police (DGP) to give special protection to T.N. Prathapan, MLA, after he received a threat letter. The police have intensified investigation to find the sender. The letter has warned the MLA against his alleged stand against the Sangh Parivar forces.“The letter points to the increasing intolerance in the State,” Mr. Prathapan said. If the condition continued, people would not be able to express their views or pray peacefully in religious places, he added. “I was targeted as I stood firmly against injustice,” he said. He attended the inaugural function of Thrissur Revenue District Youth Festival on Tuesday.
