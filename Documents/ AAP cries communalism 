Alleging the Bharatiya Janata Party of spreading communalism through Ram Janma Bhoomi Temple issue, Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday said that the saffron party should not use varsities for such seminars and alleged that the move was aimed at the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.Terming it a “sensitive issue”, senior AAP leader Ashutosh said that the case is pending before the Supreme Court and the decision on it should be by the judiciary and not outside.“We are not opposed to the move of discussion on Ram Mandir in DU as we believe that the universities should be a place for healthy discussions of various issues. Our problem is using the seminar for communalising the atmosphere,” Ashutosh said.“There were riots in Muzaffarnagar before the Lok Sabha polls. Then there were communal riots in Delhi before the state polls. Ahead of Bihar polls, Dadri (where rumours of beef consumption led to killing of man) was exploited. And before the Uttar Pradesh polls, you (BJP) have brought up the Ram Mandir issue again,” he said.“We want politics over Roti Kapda aur Makan and not religion,” Ashutosh said.AAP's Delhi unit convenor Dilip Pandey also questioned the move of renting out the venue for the seminar as the varsity in the past had denied permission to the party to carry out party-related programmes in its premises.Meanwhile, the Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS), party's student wing, also agitated against the seminar in the campus. The protesters were detained by the police but were later let off.
