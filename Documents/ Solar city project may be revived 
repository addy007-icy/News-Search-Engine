The MCC is planning to revive the solar city project, which has been put on the back-burner. The government had released Rs. 50 lakh a few years ago towards the project. Mayor Byrappa told The Hindu that he was surprised to know that the project had not been implemented though the government had released grants to set up an office and install solar power plants at certain places, including three selected parks in the city. He said that the proposed solar park was expected to generate huge quantity of solar power. However, the project did not take off due to official apathy, the Mayor added. Mr. Byrappa said that he would trace the related files and revive the project at the earliest. The Mayor also said that he had information that solar units were installed in Kuppanna and Cheluvamba parks and a few solar lights were functioning at the parks.The government had releasedRs. 50 lakh a few years ago towards the project
