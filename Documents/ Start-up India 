No one can dispute the fact that a scheme like ‘Start-up India, Stand-up India’ is long overdue (“PM unveils liberal start-up ecosystem,” Jan.17). The government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has taken a commendable step by providing tax sops and simplifying procedures. However, allocating Rs.10,000 crore for seed capital amounts to colossal mismanagement of the taxpayers’ money, at a time while the aggregate spending on various social welfare schemes is low. Besides, the condition that funding will be given only to start-ups managed by firms having experience of at least five years is spurious and goes against the very idea of a start-up.Abdu Dhwani,ThiruvananthapuramThe scheme, providing a welcome platform for aspiring minds, has great potential. The youth in our society are changing their attitudes towards entrepreneurship. However, the government also needs to promote collaboration between academia and industry. Universities should have special innovation centres for research on agriculture, health, environment and other areas. Educational courses need to be moulded and made more industry-friendly to make students prepared and motivated to take start-up projects early in their career.Narsing Kendre,Latur, Maharashtra
