The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission has struck down a plea by Kerala State Electricity Board Limited to recover fuel surcharge from consumers for the whole of financial year 2014-15 as the Board has not been regular in filing details under Fuel Surcharge Regulations, 2009 at the end of each quarter.“Since KSEB Ltd had not submitted the necessary and sufficient details pertaining to the eight quarters in the financial years 2012-13 and 2013-14, KSEB Ltd has forfeited its claim to recover admissible fuel surcharge in accordance with the provisions of the Fuel Surcharge Regulations,” said the Regulatory Commission order. The Commission had, however, acknowledged KSEB’s claim.The surcharge claim comprised Rs.34.95 crore to be recovered from consumers for the period between July and September 2014; Rs.44.55 crore for the period between October and December 2014; and Rs.43.85 crore for the period between January and March 2015.The Commission directed the Board to submit relevant data to enable it to take an appropriate decision on the issue. The Commission observed that data for the whole of 2012-13 and 2013-14 might not have been filed because the Board might have been forced to repay the excess realisation of electricity charges to the consumers.
