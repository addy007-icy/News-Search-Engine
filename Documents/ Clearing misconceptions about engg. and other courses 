Curious to learn about courses ranging from microbiology to ‘military training’, around 300 eleventh standard students from prominent city schools converged at a career counselling session at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Hall here on Monday.The event was organised jointly by The Hindu in School and Gitam University. R. Venkat Nadh, Deputy Director of Admissions, School of Technology of the university’s Bangaluru campus, cleared a few misconceptions among students about engineering and other courses.Referring to courses such as mechanical and civil engineering, he said that they might not rake in as much salary as in the IT sector and graduates might not be sent abroad on assignments. But they have a relatively ‘smoother’ life. Electrical and electronics engineering is a seemingly tough course, but graduates get posted in public-sector enterprises like Indian Railways. Software professionals need sound analytical skills and command over maths and physics is secondary.Many students from Kerala are opting for B. Tech (petroleum engineering) course, because of job potential in West Asia. Masters in petrochemical engineering is yet another attractive career option.Detailing the difference between agriculture engineering and B.Sc (Agriculture), Mr. Nadh said that the former is focused on equipment and machinery used for agriculture, harvesting, etc., while the latter probes ways to increase crop yield. Many youths who fail to get admission for MBBS course are opting for B.Tech (Bio-Chemical Engineering).He exhorted students and parents not to take at face value details of different colleges and universities and the degrees they confer. “You must personally visit these institutions and enquire with others.”Interesting questionsThe interesting questions included ‘How to pursue military studies’. The NDA selects plus-two graduates and impart training. They can also pursue B.Tech and M.Tech while in the services.Government jobs are aplenty for B.Sc (agriculture) graduates. Allied courses include horticulture, dairy, food technology and food science. Do not go by the name alone of each course since there are misnomers, Mr. Nadh told the students.
