How could it be if about 6,000 litres of water is recharged near a borewell? Well, there can never be water problem. If this is replicated at every residential school and hostel, the students need not worry about water problem at all.This is what the administration is aiming at.What could be termed as an ambitious task, the district administration is proposing to recharge as much as 12 lakh litres of water every day in the district. This will be implemented by constructing soak pits at government residential schools and hostels, whose number is put at 264.It is estimated that there would be around 40,000 students in all these schools and hostels and the water each student uses per day would be about 30 litres for bathing and other requirements.This novel scheme would be implemented under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) by involving Panchayat Raj and Rural Development departments.The estimated cost of each soak pit would be around Rs. 2.34 lakh, whereas the individual soak pits that were constructed in villages was about Rs.4,000.This was continuation of an initiative that was commenced and implemented successfully at Ibrahimpur village in Siddipet mandal of Medak district.Novel initiativeThe initiative was taken by Collector Ronald Rose, and the district administration has decided to extend this to all the hostels and residential schools in the district.The experiments of soak pits commenced at Ibrahimpur, a village adopted by Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao, and it was a grand success, and it was stated that the ground water level increased by three feet in the last six months due to percolation about one lakh litres of water every day.“The result of implementation of soak pits in Ibrahimpur and some other villages was excellent and the ground water level has considerably increased. Hence, we want to implement that in hostels where the water consumption would be heavy. The difference will be that the size of soak pits would be much bigger when compared to the individual soak pits constructed in villages,” Mr. Ronald Rose told The Hindu .
