Members of the district unit of the Karnataka State College Guest Lecturers’ Association will go on an indefinite strike protesting against the delay in fulfilling their demands, from Monday.Association district president Sushil Jadhav said that guest lecturers from government colleges would boycott classes and launch a dharna outside the office of the Deputy Commissioner in Dharwad.Mr. Jadhav said that the government was not serious about fulfilling their demands. The government had not increased the salaries of guest lecturers despite several appeals. They were getting only Rs. 9,500 even as they should be paid Rs. 25,000 a month as per the University Grant’s Commission guidelines. Unlike the regular staff, guest lecturers were being paid salaries only for nine to 10 months a year.Their other demands include fixing work load between eight and 16 hours and extension of casual leave and maternity leave benefits.
