To protect consumers from misleading advertisements and sale of fake products, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs is now focussing on creating consumer awareness through a public-private partnership (PPP) initiative.Announcing this decision here on Saturday, Union Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that the Union government has also discussed with companies, the possibility of setting aside a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility fund to create consumer awareness, especially in rural areas. Mr. Paswan was speaking after inaugurating the Southern Regional Consultation on Consumer Protection.He said that the PPP initiative would be launched on the occasion of World Consumer Rights Day on March 15.“We have already discussed the issue with industry bodies such as CII, FICCI and Assocham … They are also open to the idea of taking up consumer awareness as part of their CSR ,” Mr. Paswan said.Consumer Protection AuthorityTo initiate a strong consumer protection regime, the Union government is working on stringent consumer laws encompassing a product liability clause.This will enable the Union government to make erring manufacturers and suppliers liable to pay punitive damages not just to the complainant but to all those who have been affected by the sub-standard product.For instance, if there is a complaint of a faulty car engine, the proposed authority will have powers to check if all the engines manufactured in that particular batch are defective and penalise the manufacturer, Mr. Paswan explained.Expressing concern over pendency of cases in consumer courts, he said that the Union government has plans to revamp infrastructure and strengthen these courts.
