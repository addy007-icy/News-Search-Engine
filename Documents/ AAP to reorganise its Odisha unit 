In a bid to reorganise the party to become a feasible political alternative in the State, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is expected to come up with its new State committee in Odisha by February-end.Stating this to newsmen here on Monday, observer of AAP for Odisha, Khemchand Jagirdar said the party has already dismantled its State committee. At present the party is continuing with its ‘mission vistar’ in Odisha to reorganise and strengthen its grass root level organisation here. According to Mr Jagirdar, the aim is to reorganise the party from booth-level to the Assembly constituency-level through ‘mission vistar’. But when asked whether the AAP will fight the coming panchayat polls in Odisha, Mr Jagirdar said it had not been decided.Mr Jagirdar was critical of the BJD government and said it remained in power only because the voters here did not have a better alternative. “It is an irony that Odisha CM still lacks knowledge of Odia language and has no direct link with the common masses,” he added.
