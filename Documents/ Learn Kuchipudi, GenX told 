Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Monday exhorted the people to contribute to their mite to preserve the glorious Telugu culture.Floored by a scintillating performance by Kuchipudi artistes during the third phase of the Janmabhoomi Maa Vooru here, he said: “Our traditional dance forms get more patronage across the world than in the State of their origin.”The situation should change for the better with each and every household introducing youth to Kuchipudi. Interacting with a pensioner, Konda Reddy, the Chief Minister said: “Our family system is our strength. We must not ape the western culture, where families members get separated at the drop of a hat.”
