Angry commuters got down on the track and prevented the movement of a suburban train at Guindy railway station on Tuesday evening after a 52-year-old man was allegedly assaulted by a policeman.R. Rajkumar (52) of Thoraipakkam, working in a hotel, said that he was beaten up by Natarajan, a special sub-inspector (SSI) without provocation while he was waiting to return home. Commuters at the station said one waiting passenger had complained to the SSI about Rajkumar’s offensive behaviour, reportedly under the influence of alcohol.However, the policeman, instead of asking Rajkumar to behave properly, started beating him up.

As news about the police action spread, the waiting commuters got down from the platform on the track and prevented the train’s movement for nearly 20 minutes.However, railway police said that Natarajan, attached to of Virugambakkam police station, was on duty at the time and that he resorted to only “minor force” on Rajkumar, who had, under the influence of alcohol, disturbed a waiting passenger and used abusive language when the SSI intervened.
