Hence, commuters wait by the side of the highway.”However, he added that even though a few buses take the service road, many people stand by the side of the national highway to board a goods carrier or lorry to save on the bus fare.ProtestsImmediately after the accident, people of nearby villages blocked NH 48 for more than an hour. They also burnt tyres on the road. They alleged that buses do not use the service road, forcing people to wait by the side of the highway despite risk to their lives.
