Increasing traffic and demand for greater parking space is set to cost Vijayapura one of its heritage structures. The Model Government Girls’ School at Gandhi Chowk, which is over a century old, will soon give way to a parking place or a city bus stand.The school, with a current strength of 250 students from classes I to 7, was built in 1906 in memory of Queen Victoria during the British rule. Recently, the district administration issued an order to close the school and shift the students to a nearby Government PU College.Speaking to The Hindu , S.G. Rajashekhar, Commissioner of the city corporation, said once the building is handed over, they would start demolition. “The corporation has already earmarked Rs. 3.5 crore for the purpose and are waiting for the Education Department to pass the building to us,” he said.However, many former students and teachers feel the school should not be demolished as it one of the oldest government girls’ schools in the State. Recently, some of them staged a protest against the decision.Ranganath Akkalkot, a former teacher, said such a school of historical significance needed to be preserved. “Such marvellous architecture should not be razed,” he said.Unmindful of these arguments, the district administration feels it is “inevitable” to find some solution to the growing problems of traffic and parking.The officials, defending the decision, said since the students will be shifted to the PU College located just a few yards away from the school, it will not make much difference. “The PU College has a bigger playground, which is not available in the present school,” an official said.Besides the school, an old library, also known as Radio Maidan, which is adjacent to PU College, is also likely to be demolished to provide parking facility.
