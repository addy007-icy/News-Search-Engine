Utnoor Integrated Tribal Development Agency and Community Health Centre on Sunday organised a special medical camp for pregnant Adivasi women. About 88 women from the Kolam tribe got their blood samples tested for anaemia and were subjected to scanning by experts. ITDA Project Officer R.V. Karnan urged the Adivasis to seek treatment at government hospitals and shun superstitious practices. He said an ambulance can be summoned to transport a pregnant woman to hospital by dialling the toll free number 18004255226.The Project Officer suggested that the Adivasis cultivate vegetables in their backyard. Eating leafy vegetables regularly will control anaemia, he added.
