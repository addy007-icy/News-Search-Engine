Justice Vilas Afzulpurkar of the Hyderabad High Court on Monday directed the AP Government not to dispossess the farmers of the lands being cultivated in the name of Greenfield airport at Bhogapuram in Vizianagarm district.The judge was dealing with a batch of petitions filed by the farmers.They said that land acquisition was bad in law. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, was invoked for issuing the notification.While giving notification, the State government relied upon the ordinance issued by the Central Government that dispensed with the social impact assessment and protection to the double crop lands. This ordinance had lapsed without becoming a law.The petitioners contended that the notification dispensed with pubic consultation while preparing the social impact assessment. As the ordinance lapsed, the notification failed.The judge felt that there was prima facie case and said that the farmers may not be dispossessed.The ordinance lapsed the day on which the Collector issued the notification. The case is adjourned for final hearing. Mr. Justice Vilas made it clear that the petitioners could file their objections before the authorities and that the latter would consider the same and pass appropriate orders that were subject to the final outcome of the case.
