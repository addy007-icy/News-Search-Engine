Few have captured the soul of India like photographer Raghu Rai.The country’s most iconic moments, from the Bhopal gas tragedy to Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister via Varanasi’s ghats and Old Delhi’s bazaars , all have been timelessly captured by Mr. Rai’s lens.In a self-curated exhibition at Ojas Art Gallery here till January 30, the award-winning photographer presents 50 images from an illustrious career spanning 50 years.Tucked away in a serene enclave beside the Qutub Minar, the gallery houses Mr. Rai’s work away from the cacophony of traffic noise and street chatter. The minimalist gallery abandons all ornamentation and draws the viewer to the intended subjects — large framed photographs along a dimly-lit corridor, each one from his diverse portfolio of travels around the country over the past five decades.Walking through the exhibition, which began on December 18, visitors are transported from their immediate surroundings to various locations across the country.Mr. Rai’s first photograph of a baby donkey in soft focus, taken with his brother Yog Joy’s camera, hangs inconspicuously amongst other recognisable classics. The other photographs feature the Dalai Lama’s home in Dharamsala and the surreal landscape of Ladakh. Mr. Rai’s photography inspires an immediate reaction from the audience.He said: “If people can connect with my pictures and enjoy them, that’s enough for me. It is just like a little nudge… a recognition of humanity and life.”While Mr. Rai is a household name in the country, exhibition organiser Devyani Sahai remarked: “We wanted people to revisit his work. He has played a very important role in Indian photography, but the younger generation does not know about his contributions.”(The author is an intern with The Hindu )
