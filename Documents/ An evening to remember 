For the young trainees at the Global Table Tennis Academy celebrating its fifth anniversary, it was an evening to remember as two of the big names in Indian table tennis – Soumyadeep Roy and Soumyajit Ghosh – shared their experiences and gave a few tips to them during their brief interaction.Soumyadeep, a two-time national champion and also Commonwealth Championship team gold medallist, and Soumyajit, reigning national champion, who are in the city for the on going Senior National Championship, reminded the young paddlers that there is no short cut to success. “You have to play the game with passion and complete dedication. This is the best way to taste success at the highest level,” they remarked. The champion shuttlers appreciated the role of parents and coaches in shaping the career of the young paddlers even while recollecting how they were the beneficiaries of supportive parents who sacrificed a lot for their success. The two of the leading paddlers from India also appreciated the contribution of GTTA coach, Somnath Ghosh, in producing international and national medallists from this relatively obscure academy which has only two tables on the first floor of the community hall. “Somnath is known for his dedication. Back home, we feel very happy for his achievements,” Soumyadeep said. In the presence of the two special guests, the GTTA coach Somnath was felicitated by the senior coach Mihir Ghosh.“Bengal’s loss is Telangana’s gain. My State is unable to take the services of Somnath because he is working in Hyderabad,” said Mihir Ghosh, a proud father of a promising paddler, Arjun Ghosh.Responding to the felicitations, Somnath said that he would continue to dedicate himself to producing more champions from the GTTA.
