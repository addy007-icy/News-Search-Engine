With the district police setting the deadline of compulsory helmets for two-wheeler riders and pillion as January-end, helmet sales has suddenly proliferated in the district.On Railway Station Road alone, at least a dozen helmet sellers were found busy selling helmets. The price ranges between Rs. 350 and Rs. 500. With residents of the city having no choice, but to buy the helmets, most of the shops were crowded. And as far as the vendors were concerned, they were doing brisk business. Meanwhile, speaking to The Hindu , Superintendent of Police, S. N. Siddaramappa, said that the police would give time for the residents to buy helmets before they start fining the violators. “In the interest of people, we are giving them some time to buy helmets. It would not be fair to start fining them now … most of them are yet to buy helmets owing to short-supply”, he said. He, however, said that the police would implement the rule strictly from February 1. “As per the norms, the rider and the pillion should wear a helmet while riding.”He also rubbished rumours that half-helmet (a helmet that covers only the head) is meant for women. Mr. Siddaramappa also advised people to buy helmets with the ISI mark on them. Meanwhile, he admitted that ensuring people follow the rule is a hard task for the police, mainly in rural areas.“In cities and town limits, the police can keep a vigil … but it is too hard in rural areas owing to limited police staff. However, we will try our best to implement the rule across the district”, he said.He said that first-time violators would be fined Rs.100 and the second-time they have to pay Rs. 300. If they violate for the third time, then their driving license would be cancelled, he said.
