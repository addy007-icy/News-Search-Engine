The Puducherry Contract Medical Officers Association (PCMOA) has urged the Government to regularise the services of medical officers on the lines of contract doctors who were regularised in 1981. A resolution to this effect was adopted at a consultative meeting of PCMOA recently.The association also wanted the government to regularise the services of those who had put in over 18 years of service in the health department.In another resolution, the association has demanded the government to increase the pay scale of contract medical officers besides sanctioning general leave and maternity leave with pay.No proper salaryThe association said that the medical officers taken on contractual basis do not get proper salary.The contract medical officers cannot avail medical leave and even female doctors cannot claim maternity leave or benefits. Besides, they can avail only one day leave in a month. If they take more than two days, their salaries will be cut.The other demands of the association include scrapping of renewal of contracts after 120 days of work and two days of leave, posting of adequate medical officers in all Primary health centres and government hospitals as per the doctor-patient ratio in the country.Job regularisationThe association has also urged the Puducherry administration to seek approval from the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to regularise their jobs on the lines of the new policy in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
