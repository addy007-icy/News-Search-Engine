Government is planning to create coastal economic zones along the country’s 7,500-km long coastline covering many States, ports and special economic zones having uniform policy to further boost manufacturing.“There is a thinking in the government that there should be a port-led development as was done in China where cities were granted special status of open coastal cities. These cities enjoyed special policies of the government,” a senior official told PTI.Though India has many ports, there is no cluster or a section of coastline that enjoys special status and incentives.However, there are special economic zones where investors can set up their manufacturing base and get incentives such as tax exemption, speedy regulatory clearance, round-the-clock power and security.
