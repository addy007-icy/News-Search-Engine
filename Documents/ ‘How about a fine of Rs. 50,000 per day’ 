The Supreme Court on Thursday proposed slapping a recurring fine of Rs. 50,000 on builders who violate pollution control laws at construction sites in Delhi and the NCR.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India T.S. Thakur was reacting to submissions made by amicus curiae and senior advocate Harish Salve that a one-time fine of Rs. 50,000 under the present pollution law is hardly a deterrent for polluting builders with multi-crore construction projects in their kitties.“It can be a recurring fine of Rs. 50,000 every day. Will this not be a deterrent for polluting builders?” Chief Justice Thakur responded to Mr. Salve.The court slammed pollution control authorities for turning an alleged blind eye to polluting builders and asked the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority to conduct surprise checks at construction sites and report back on the activities witnessed there so that appropriate action can be taken by the court.The hearing also saw the Delhi government submit that vacuum cleaning of Delhi streets would start from April 1, 2016. It said that vacuum cleaners purchased for the Commonwealth Games were not functional.The court also issued notice to the National Thermal Power Corporation and the Centre on a proposal to either close down the Badarpur Thermal Power Station or provide alternate fuel other than coal to power the station.It has asked for report on this from the EPCA.
