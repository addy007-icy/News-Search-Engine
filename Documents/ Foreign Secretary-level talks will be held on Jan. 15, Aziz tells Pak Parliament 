Amidst of uncertainty in the wake of the Pathankot terror attack, Pakistan Prime Minister’s Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has said Foreign Secretary-level talks with India are scheduled to take place on January 15, 2016.In reply to a question in the National Assembly, Pakistan's Parliament, Mr. Aziz on Friday said Pakistan and India’s Foreign Secretaries are scheduled to meet on January 15.He said the two Foreign Secretaries will decide the time schedule of various meetings under the newly agreed “Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue”.Mr. Aziz said Kashmir will be part of the talks between the two countries along with several other issues.Mr. Aziz’s response came to a query by Pakistan Tekreek-e-Insaf party’s Shireen Mazari, who wanted to know the status of dialogue after India’s outgoing envoy T.C.A. Raghavan’s reported remarks that his country will only discuss PoK in talks.Putting the ball squarely in Pakistan’s court, India has linked the Foreign Secretary-level talks to Islamabad’s “prompt and decisive” action on the Pathankot terror attack for which it has provided “actionable intelligence”.Uncertainty prevails on talks scheduled for January 15 in Islamabad between Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry following the terror strike on the Pathankot air base which originated from Pakistan.
