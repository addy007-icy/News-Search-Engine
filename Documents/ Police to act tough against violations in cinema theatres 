Selling eatables at astronomical rates, way above the fixed MRP, is not the only violation that one can witness in multiplexes and single theatres. If one were to go by the recent memo issued by Cyberabad Police to the theatre managements its limits, dozens of rules have been thrown to the wind for years escaping any serious action.For instance, every cinema hall should have two spaces for placing two wheelchairs at convenient positions with clamps for the benefit of the handicapped and the aged. Coming to drinking water, if piped water supply is available then water taps have to be provided at various places inside the theatre premises for free public use.Failing to find space between the routine advertisements is a short documentary that should have been screened during the shows to explain the audience on fire safety measures and emergency escapes.These are just 49 rules that are part of the memo that have been sent to the managements with an observation from the Cyberabad police that most of these rules are not being complied.“The emergency department telephone numbers of nearest hospitals, police station and fire department shall be displayed in every show,” was the 47 rule in the memo while the 48 rule read, “The management should obtain insurance coverage for all the employees and audience/visitors/vendors.”Providing escalators and elevators for the audience at the end of the show, maintaining AC temperatures between 24 C and 26 C and prohibition of advertisements to assist childless in begetting children are some of the other rules mentioned.Rakesh Reddy Dubbudu, social activist and founder of public information portal, Factly, filed the complaint against the theatre managements with the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate.
