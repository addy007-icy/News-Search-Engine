: Slamming Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for “paralysing” the functioning of civic bodies, the Delhi BJP on Friday demanded that the AAP government immediately implement recommendations of the fourth Delhi Finance Commission for payment of salaries to corporation workers. The party also threatened of taking to the streets along with employees of the municipal corporations.Attacking the government over the poor financial condition of the three BJP-ruled civic bodies, Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay said the bodies also owe Rs.2,917 crore under the third Finance Commission recommendations. “For the last one year, we have been demanding the government to provide funds to the civic bodies as per recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission, but the Kejriwal dispensation, due to political malice, has not implemented it,” he said.
