The Nishagandhi open-air auditorium, the only one of its kind with a permanent screen and stage in the State, on the sprawling premises of Kanakakunnu palace in the capital is to get butterfly-shaped permanent roofing.The green-hued roofing for the stage and auditorium that can accommodate 3,000 persons is designed to gel with the environs of the 18-acre premises of the palace that is listed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) as a heritage monument.The decision to provide permanent roofing and to make it an ‘all-weather venue’ comes in the wake of the demand for an auditorium from many quarters, including the film fraternity, to hold film shows and cultural programmes.Once the roofing is provided, Nishagandhi can even be used during daytime to screen films and to stage dance, music and other entertainment programmes. The work for roof has commenced with the government giving the administrative sanction for the Rs.3.5-crore work.The permanent roof using the hollow steel is being executed by the public sector Steel Industries Kerala Ltd. (SILK). The government has given the SILK six months to complete the work. A five-member technical committee headed by Director, Tourism, has been set up to examine the quality and financial aspects.The work will be taken up after the week-long Nishagandhi festival and the permanent roof is expected to be completed in one month, a tourism official told The Hindu .“The roof will look like a giant butterfly from the top and it will match with the heritage beauty of the palace and the green environs”, he added.Money-spinnerThe roof will turn out to be a money-spinner for Kerala Tourism, as it will be able to rent out the auditorium for all 365 days. The ample parking space and the adjacent Sooryakanthi exhibition grounds for holding fairs and exhibitions are the other advantages of Nishagandhi auditorium.The landscaping of the palace, an erstwhile durbar and banquet hall of the Travancore royal family and one of the key landmarks of the capital, was completed in 2015. The auditorium was the venue for the recent concert of Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali.
