The Central Information Commission has pulled up the National Green Tribunal for its wasteful expenditure towards litigation fee to press its demand for payment of Rs.40 for disclosure of information.The matter is related to a query by RTI activist R.K. Jain, who had sought to know the number of RTI applications received by the NGT and the status of their disposal. The CPIO insisted on payment of Rs. 40 for 20 pages of information.Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order that it appeared from the RTI responses furnished by the NGT that it was ready to spend more than Rs. 33,000 to deny 20 pages, claiming Rs. 40 from the appellant despite direction by First Appellate Authority to give information.“The officers concerned should mind that such an amount belonged to the people of India and officers are like trustees, who need to decide to spend only for the benefit of general public without causing wastage,” said the order.The Information Commissioner recommended that the NGT Chairman, who is also a former Judge of the Supreme Court, consider recovering the amount, if any, spent in the case, from the officer found responsible for it and deposit the amount back in favour of the NGT.Mr. Acharyulu said it was pathetic that the NGT office did not care while incurring expenditure of Rs.11,000 to hire services of lawyers to argue in the first appeal that the information was not given because of non-payment of Rs.40.For the same, they were ready to forgo Rs.21,000 for lawyer to argue a single sentence before the Commission in the second appeal, stated the order.The CIC imposed the maximum penalty on the CPIO, saying his liability under Section 20 of the RTI Act had been established by all means. A penalty of Rs.25,000 was imposed on him, which will be recovered in five instalments of Rs.5,000 each.The Information Commissioner also instructed the NGT to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the CPIO for not following orders of the First Appellate Authority within the NGT.CIC pulls up green body for wasteful expenditure towards litigation fee over an RTI
