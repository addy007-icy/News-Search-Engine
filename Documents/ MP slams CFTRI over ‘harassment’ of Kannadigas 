Pratap Simha, MP, on Monday alleged that the CFTRI management had been unkind to Kannadigas working in the premier institute and said the alleged “suffocating atmosphere” had to be set right immediately.During his address at a programme held at CFTRI campus here, Mr. Simha maintained that the Kannadiga staff members had lost trust in the administration with restrictions imposed on pro-Kannada activities in the campus.“The employees are being victimised,” he charged.The MP said he had raised the matter with Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, who was present, and with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. There is a need to establish an appropriate environment for our scientists to function at the institute, he suggested.Referring to those at the helm of affairs at the institute, the MP said, “You can take my words either as an advice or as a warning.”The MP said the management must remember that the magnificent palace which houses the institute had been gifted by the Mysuru Wadiyars and it should refrain from “committing” any “unsettling” acts.It may be mentioned here that some pro-Kannada groups had staged protests here in the past against CFTRI director Ram Rajashekaran over the allegations of “anti-Kannada” stance by the institute.However, the director had strongly denied such charges.
