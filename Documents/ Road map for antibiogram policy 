A public-private entity will be set up to monitor and audit the implementation of the antibiogram policy that the State will soon have. Such an entity will bring in more accountability regarding the use of antibiotics in all public and private institutions, K. Ellangovan, Secretary, Health, told The Hindu .It is yet to be decided what shape the entity will take, a society or board.It will be an industry-driven body that will be taking up the role of the auditor, he said.There is no legal remedy for inappropriate use of antibiotics and medical negligence. The antibiotic policy will empower the civil society with information. As the patient communityâ€™s approach to a physician is trust-based alone, such information will also help patients have an evidence-based approach to health-care demands, Dr. Ellangovan said.According to medical experts, though antibiotics are generally used for bacterial infections, they are commonly used for treating common cold, acute diarrhoeal infections, and fever.This is inappropriate because antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. Faulty treatment regime results in microbes evolving with antibiotic-resistance properties.The antibiogram policy will create a model for judicious use of antibiotics, for both public and private health facilities, Dr. Ellangovan said.
