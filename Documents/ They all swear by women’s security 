With more women in the fray this year than in last elections for the GHMC, women’s security has become de-facto part of manifestos. Noticeably, aspirants are making promises about improving security which strictly is not a municipality subject.Compared to 2009 elections when 40 wards were reserved for women, 75 wards have been reserved this time. In all, more than 300 women are in the fray in the city with 34.5 lakh registered female voters. The women reserved wards alone have 17.7 lakh female voters, nearly a quarter of GHMC’s electorate, which according to candidates is reason enough to discuss women security.“Though a state subject, women security cannot be alienated from the city’s functioning. In areas like Ameerpet where there are many hostels with women, security inadvertently is part of the discussion, with voters raising the matter,” said Dr. Kathyayani Burugula, the BJP aspirant from Ameerpet. “As an aspirant I am assuring voters of my support in bringing increased police presence, CCTVs and dedicated help centers for victims of gender-perpetuated crimes.”Most other women candidates in reserved wards are making similar promises. The ruling TRS party for instance, with the police at its disposal, has made Safe Hyderabad as part of its stated manifesto. Unlike others, its women candidates are not being reserved about increasing police security, women police stations and stepping up electronic surveillance.Toddy compoundsContrastingly, for the opposition TDP-BJP combine, the ruling party’s policies of instituting toddy compounds are the biggest security threats to women. Says Keerthi Mekala, TDP’s Seethaphalmandi aspirant, “Though the ruling party has instituted SHE teams, half a dozen toddy compounds and wine shops in our areas, combined with unkempt parks are trouble for women here.”
