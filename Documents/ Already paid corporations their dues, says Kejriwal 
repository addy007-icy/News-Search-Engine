The fight over funds between the Aam Aadmi Party government and the BJP-ruled municipal corporations continued on Monday with the former claiming that it had cleared all the dues.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Commissioners of the corporations had admitted that the government did not owe the civic bodies any more funds.“We held a meeting on January 15 to review the finances of the corporations. The three Commissioners gave it in writing that the government has already paid what was due,” he said at a press conference.He added that the BJP leadership in the corporations was politicising the issue. “The Mayors are political animals,” said Mr. Kejriwal.The government even released the minutes of the meeting, which show that the amount allocated for the corporations for 2015-2016 has been released. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation had been given Rs.892.92 crore and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs.465.53 crore as non-plan budgetary allocations. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation had been paid 80 per cent of the Rs.830.41 crore allocated, with the rest having been given since then.The government said the corporations had been given the non-plan budget, from which salaries are meant to be paid. The North and East Delhi corporations have been unable to pay salaries on time, with three months’ wages pending currently.The civic bodies have had a long-standing demand for money from the Municipal Reform Fund (MRF). The government said that there was a provision of Rs.374 crore as MRF for the bodies, but all but the SDMC were ineligible for it as they had failed to improve their financial position.Meanwhile, officials of the corporations said they had made the required reforms to be eligible for the MRF. They also claimed that funds for the education sector had been deducted by the government.
