Commuters using Kempegowda Bus Station (KBS) are back to avoiding the skywalk again, barely three months after a teenager was knocked down by a bus when she was crossing the road.Security guards in charge of ensuring that people do not cross the road at unsafe spots are at a loss as they have to deal with hundreds of irate pedestrians every day. Most refuse to use the skywalk, saying it is inconvenient to use, and find it easier to dodge buses. It doesn’t help that the skywalk is not built in a manner friendly to the differently-abled and senior citizens. “We have several elderly people who, when told to use the skywalk, say they do not have the energy to climb up the stairs. Those with physical disabilities tell us they cannot use it. We have no choice but to let these people cross,” a security official said.The station sees an hourly traffic of about 160 buses and 3,000 passengers. In addition to 15 officials tasked with ensuring safety, 20 more were deployed last October. However, all of them say they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of people who break the rules.All over the bus station, people can be seen walking side by side with moving buses or crossing the road. The Mount Carmel student’s death seems to have been forgotten. “I keep a lookout for buses and only cross the road after ensuring no buses are anywhere near me. However, it has been a while since I used the skywalk,” admitted Raghu, a commuter. Another official said pedestrians need to take look after themselves and understand the risks of not using the skywalk. “We try and send people to the skywalk whenever possible, but it is impossible to stop and turn back large groups when they decide to cross,” the official said. A zebra crossing designed over a road hump is also ignored by the commuters as it is located exactly in the middle of the semi-circular bus station.
