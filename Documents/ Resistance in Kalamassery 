: Though the Kalamassery municipal council unanimously approved the laying of pipeline for domestic natural gas connections in wards 10 and 12 of the municipality, a small group of people have come out against the project.Vast majority are in for PNG, said T.A. Abdul Salam, member of the municipal council representing Peringazha, ward 10. He said he wanted PNG connections to all the homes in the ward, though initially it was planned only for around 250 households.V.S. Aboobacker, councillor representing HMT Estate, ward 12, of the municipality said that some people had expressed apprehensions about the safety aspect and pointed out that a group of officials had met the local people to explain.The group opposing the pipeline had demanded that the pipeline should be laid only after the road passing through the Kinfra park was repaired. Mr. Aboobacker said that the minister for public works had promised to repair the road.Mr. Salam said that the road was an excuse for some people to block the pipeline work. Linking the two issues was not logical, he said. There is enthusiasm among the people as Kalamassery would have been the first municipality to have domestic PNG connections, he added as he called for creating awareness among people. He also pointed out that expatriates from the area were the ones who came out strongly in favour of the piped gas project as soon as it was announced.
