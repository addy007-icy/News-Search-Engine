A 30-year-old woman’s blood-ridden body was found at her home in North-East Delhi’s Seelampur area on Wednesday morning.Since the woman’s husband has been missing ever since the crime came to light, the police suspect him to be behind the murder.The couple’s seven-year-old son too has not been traced yet, prompting the police to believe that he has been taken away by his father. A search for both was on at the time of filing this report.Neighbours have told the police that the couple quarrelled frequently over domestic issues. The police have also learnt that there was trust deficit between the couple, which is being seen as one of the primary reasons behind the murder. The victim has been identified as Firoza, a native of West Bengal who lived with her family in Seelampur’s Shastri Park area.Firoza was a housewife, while her absconding husband did odd jobs. They had moved into the rented flat only around a month ago.The crime came to light around 11 a.m. on Wednesday when a relative came to visit the family. He opened the house that was latched from outside to see Firoza lying in a pool of blood near the door.He immediately informed the neighbours who in turn called police. The victim was declared brought dead at the hospital and her body was sent for post-mortem.Given the nature of injuries, she is suspected of being killed with a sharp weapon, possibly a kitchen knife. However, no weapon of offence has been recovered yet.Given the nature of injuries, she is suspected of having been killed with a sharp weapon
