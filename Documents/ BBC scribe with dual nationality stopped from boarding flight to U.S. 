A BBC journalist has been prevented from boarding a flight to New Jersey because of her dual British-Iranian nationality after a new U.S. law barred dual citizens of some countries, including Iran, from using the visa waiver programme.Rana Rahimpour, who is a presenter at the BBC’s Persian service, was stopped from travelling to New Jersey because of the U.S.’ tough new visa-waiver programme, which bars dual citizens from several nationalities — including Iran — from entering the U.S. without a proper visa.Visitors to “terrorist havens” excuseThe new legislation also excludes anyone who has travelled to countries designated as “terrorist havens.”Citizens of European Union member states, including Britain, have previously been able to enter the U.S. without a visa as long as they have been cleared in advance under an electronic authorisation scheme known as Esta.Have to apply for visaBut the new restrictions mean anybody who has travelled to Iran, Iraq, Syria and Sudan since 2011 will have to apply for a visa.The new rules apply to anyone, including journalists, aid workers and business executives. Only soldiers, who have been deployed in the countries by their own governments, are exempt.Unfair to Iranians: RahimpourAfter being stopped by officials at Heathrow on Tuesday, Ms. Rahimpour said: “Most people think new U.S. travel restrictions not effective until April.“I just feel it’s unfair, it’s unfair to many Iranians. My cousins, who were travelling with me and faced similar problems, have left Iran 20 years ago, they don’t know how to write or read Farsi and they are paying the price for the politics of a country that they have nothing to do with,” she told the Guardian.Last month, the visa-waiver changes had triggered protest by EU Ambassadors to the U.S. over what is seen as a de-facto visa regime.
