 It was a celebration of autism. The three-day conference ‘Healing Autism’ was a forum for parents to share their experiences of living with children who have autism spectrum disorders, for special educators to speak about the knowledge they gain from these children; and for researchers to look at the ‘spiritual’ aspect of the condition.Also, the event also celebrated those with autism spectrum disorders who have displayed unparallel knowledge.The brain behind this one-of-a-kind event was Mythily Chari, special educator, who has worked with people in the spectrum for over 30 years.“I owe this to my students. Whatever I know about autism, I have learnt from them. They are my gurus. These children can be poets, philosophers, orators, unmanageable teenagers and babies all at once. Some display exceptional inherent talent. There is a need to understand them, beyond medicine. This conference seeks to do just that,” she says.The conference had a mix of lectures and workshops, with the focus on healing through yoga, music and diet. The conference took autism a step further to call those in the spectrum ‘a new race’.Thasleem Farzana, a special educator, spoke in her lecture about how ancient scriptures and writers had foretold the coming of the sixth race.“Those on the spectrum belong to this race. At present, we are only looking at treating the external symptoms those in the spectrum display. We hardly have any understanding of their core,” she says.The event also saw the release of five books on autism, one by Aishwarya Sriram, a person in the spectrum, who can solve huge puzzles in no time. The conference was held in collaboration with Lotus Foundation at Alumni Club Anna University, Boat Club Road.
