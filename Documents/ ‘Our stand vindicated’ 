The Delhi High Court’s decision to transfer the municipal corporations’ pension scheme to the State government was seen as a vindication by the leaders of the civic bodies who have been saying that their funds were being stopped by the government.The Court told the corporations to give the details of the beneficiaries of their pension scheme for senior citizens, widows and differently-abled persons to the government, which was in turn asked to accommodate them. The civic bodies have been unable to disburse pensions to the about 2 lakh beneficiaries over two years now.Ashish Sood, the Leader of the House in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, said: “The court’s decision has vindicated our stand. We have been saying that the Delhi Government has withheld our funds due to political reasons.”The court had taken into account the poor financial health of the corporations when it asked the government to take over the payments.Mr. Sood added that it was not important which agency paid the beneficiaries, but only that they were given their pensions on time.Echoing that, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Ravinder Gupta said the citizens should get relief.He added that the North Corporation had already given the Delhi Government’s Social Welfare Department, which also has a pension scheme, the details of beneficiaries.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the worst-hit financially, would have paid the pensions if the government had been releasing funds on time, said Mayor Harsh Deep Malhotra.
