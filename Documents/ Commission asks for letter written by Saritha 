The G. Sivarajan Commission inquiring into the solar scam on Friday directed one of the prime accused Saritha S. Nair to produce the controversial letter purported to have been written by her while languishing in prison at Pathanamthitta.Counsel for the accused submitted that the commission could not ask for the production of the letter as it was a personal matter and did not have anything to do with the solar case. Besides, the terms of reference of the commission did allow the commission to issue such a directive.However, the commission rejected the contentions and issued the directive. The commission exempted Tinny Joppan, former personal staff of the Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, from appearing before the commission on Thursday.Mr. Joppan had filed an application seeking exemption on health grounds.
