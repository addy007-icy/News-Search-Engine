In a stark pointer to the dismal condition of the shopping-cum-bus station building complex at Kumbla near here, a young girl was on Friday injured after a concrete flake fell on her.Ayishath Shahina, a resident of Kolathur, along with other students, was waiting at the building to board a bus when the broken concrete material fell down. The injured girl was shifted to a nearby hospital.The complex that was built in the mid 1970s has been in a dilapidated condition, possibly due to the low quality construction work. The governing body of the grama panchayat had submitted a proposal to the technical consultant, Kitco, for taking up reconstruction work. However, the request was not approved by the State government, former Kumbla grama panchayat president P.H. Ramla told The Hindu .The panchayat had approached a Kozhikode-based agency to prepare a building plan to replace the existing one. But, the agency could not come up with the sketch apparently due to uncertainty over the location of the bus station.“There is an urgent need to speed up the proposed reconstruction work of the building complex as around 5,000 students use the bus station,” Ms. Ramla said.The previous governing body had faced serious problems in implementing orders to evict traders from the building. “Though the officials had managed to close down major entry points to the building, the decision had to be quashed owing to pressure from influential quarters,” she said.
