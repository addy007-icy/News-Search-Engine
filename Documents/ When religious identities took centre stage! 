Political parties often reach out to the most religious within communities as means to their ends, echoed writers of varying faiths at the Hyderabad Literary Festival on Sunday.Speaking during a discussion titled ‘Minding the Minority’, the authors narrated instances from their past which unwittingly made them conscious of their religious identities. From the Babri Masjid demolition to riots in Gujarat, the authors stated that such events and others have communalised all communities.“The most religious in every community have been pampered by political parties for vote, but most others have been neglected. This has happened in all religious communities,” said author Tabish Khair, even as he explained the discussion’s title.Author and lawyer Flavia Agnes recounted her experience as a Christian from Mangalore where her religion did not give her an identity. After moving to Mumbai, she said she was made conscious of her identity.Sahitya Akademi Award winner Esther David, who was born into a Jewish family, echoed similar thoughts when she spoke about post 2002 riots in Gujarat, where she hails from.Notwithstanding, the growing intolerance among minorities, the title of the discussion seems to imply, the authors did not make direct references to it.“Minding the minority not only conveys a sense of disgruntlement the minorities may have, but also implies the need to heed to all sections of minority communities,” Mr. Khair said. The discussion was moderated by author Zafar Anjum.
