The Kerala Lalithakala Akademi is on a mission to take art to the common man, as part of which its mobile art gallery will get going from Wednesday.The objective is to conduct art exhibitions where there are no art galleries, said Kattoor Narayana Pillai, chairman of the Akademi. The art gallery has been set up on a bus with state-of-the-art technology. There is ample space to display paintings, sculptures, and books, the chairman said. On display will be cave paintings, traditional murals, and works of Raja Ravi Varma, K.C.S. Panicker, Padmini, and M.V. Devan. The gallery, which will focus on Kerala art history and the latest trends in the art world, will feature works of contemporary painters too.Documentaries related to art will be screened. After an initial tour covering all districts, the mobile gallery will reach each village of the State. The gallery will display different set of paintings on each day, said Akademi secretary Vaikam M.K. Shibu.Art buffs can buy books and paintings and painters can organise independent exhibitions in the gallery. ‘A painting on a wall’ is the slogan of the mobile gallery, set up to ensure painters’ welfare. The venture aims at creating a market for paintings in the State. “Artists should be able to make a living from art. Though there are enough art aficionados in the State, Malayalis generally hesitate to shell out money for paintings,” the Mr. Shibu noted.Such a large mobile facility is first of its kind in the country, according to the Akademi. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy will flag off the mobile gallery in front of the Durbar Hall Ground on Wednesday. Art camps, documentary screening, and workshops will be organised in all districts as part of the tour.
