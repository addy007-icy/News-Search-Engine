Of course in Arunachal Pradesh, none of the stakeholders is blame-free, but the >Editorial (Jan.27), is a grim reminder of the continuing saga of misuse of powers by the Central governments of the day and the blatant misuse of discretionary powers by State Governors who often behave like the henchmen of the Centre. One can also not forget the non-assertive role of the President. We have to keep our fingers crossed to see how the Supreme Court reacts on the matter.Suddapalli Bhaskara Rao,Muscat, Sultanate of OmanThe use of Article 356 to dismiss elected governments with impunity and engineer defections began in Kerala when the E.M.S. Namboodiripad government was dismissed by the Congress government in New Delhi. Since then it became a weapon to dislodge governments inconvenient to the Centre. The Congress is now tasting its own medicine following events in Arunachal Pradesh. The Modi government’s use of this much despised statute shows that the BJP is not immune from the politics of power play and which is trying to gain a foothold in the Northeast.C.R. Narayanan,CuddaloreThe decision to promulgate President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh appears to be one of the hastiest acts ever on the part of the President (“Pranab gives assent to Central rule in Arunachal Pradesh”, Jan.27). It is unfortunate that this had to happen on Republic Day and is bound to have serious repercussions in Parliament. The nation has already seen how crucial Bills have met with non-approval in some of the most unproductive parliamentary sessions. Ultimately, it is the citizen who will have to pay the price.N.
