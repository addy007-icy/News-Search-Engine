Various public sector banks here have begun marketing the second tranche of sovereign gold bonds, which was launched earlier this week. Against an issue price of Rs. 2,684 a gm during the first tranche sold during November-December 2015, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has fixed the issue price of the second tranche of bonds at Rs. 2,600 per gm or unit. The bonds carry an interest rate of Rs. 2.75 per cent per annum on the initial value of the investment. Chief Manager of SyndicateBank’s Lashkar Mohalla branch N. Pinageeswaran said all the branches of the bank are canvassing the sale of bonds in accordance with the guidelines. The public can approach the bank’s branches to subscribe for the bonds by filling up applications, he said.The last date for subscribing to the bonds in the second tranche is January 22, while the bonds will be issued by RBI on February 8, 2016. In view of the lukewarm response to the scheme during the first tranche, public sector banks have set targets to their branches. The banks are hopeful of selling more bonds during the second tranche. Applications for sovereign gold bonds can also be submitted at the two head post offices in Mysuru (Irwin Road and Saraswathipuram).The Postal Department officials at the two head post offices, however, said the response for the scheme during the second tranche has been negligible. During the first tranche in November-December 2015, only four bonds were sold by the department in Mysuru. “While one bond of 20 gm was sold from the head post office on Irwin Road during the first tranche, three bonds of 80, 10 and 5 gm, respectively, were sold from the head post office in Saraswathipuram,” a Postal Department employee said. Though the RBI has brought down the price of the unit, investors do not find the interest attractive enough, said another Postal Department employee.Against an issue price of Rs. 2,684 a gm during first tranche, Reserve Bank of India has fixed Rs. 2,600 a gm for the second tranche of bondsPublic can approach any of SyndicateBank’s branches to subscribe for bonds by filling up applicationsLast date for subscribing to bonds in the second tranche is January 22RBI to issue bonds on February 8Applications for sovereign gold bonds can also be submitted at Irwin Road and Saraswathipuram head post offices in Mysuru
