Women writers from different backgrounds in South India shared their experiences on Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University campus on Thursday. As many as nine women interacted with the audiences on the second day of the South Indian women writers’ conclave titled Resonance and Resistance at Tirur.Inaugurating the session, novelist Chandramathi lashed out at society for its attempts to silence women, both in life and literature. Protests often go in vain, she said. “My mother cried when I published my first story,” she said, adding that she resisted society’s jeer by lampooning at it.P. Geeta, writer and activist, said that writing provided an opportunity for her mind to travel unchained. It was the village experience and a youthful curiosity within her which honed her writing, she said. Khadeeja Mumtaz, former faculty at Government Medical College, Kozhikode, said that she still lacked confidence as a writer. Religion, according to her, is a jail for women. Kannada writers L.G. Meera and H.S. Anupama, poet Bindu Krishnan, Tamil writers K.V. Shailaja, T. Vijayalakshmi and Jayanthashree Balakrishnan too shared their experiences. The three-day conclave will conclude on Friday.
