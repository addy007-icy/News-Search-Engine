A youth hailing from Odisha, suspected to be mentally deranged, was on Friday picked up by the Panagudi police here after he was wandering in a secluded place situated about 3 km from the ISRO’s Propulsion Research Centre (IPRC), Mahendragiri, a high security complex.Last month some locals had spread a rumour about a glider flew over the IPRC and landed in a nearby forest prompting the police to conduct a massive search operation in the jungle of the Western Ghats close to the high security premises but in vain. Against this backdrop, police received information about the movement of a man at Kannimar Odai near Panagudi on Friday and detained him.“He responded incoherently in Odiya to our questions. He appeared to be mentally ill and we’re trying to establish his identity,” said a police officer.
