In order to “teach a lesson” to the Congress for its reluctance in adopting the Justice A.J. Sadashiva panel report that recommended reallocation of reservations among Scheduled Caste communities in a more equitable manner, Madiga Reservation Horata Samiti (MRHS) has resolved to campaign against the Congress in the imminent bypolls to be held for Bidar, Hebbal and Deodurg Assembly Constituencies.Addressing a media conference here on Monday, the organisation’s State committee president B.A. Keshava Murthy said that local leaders and cadres of his organisations would, basing on local dynamics and contesting candidates, decide whom to support against the Congress candidates.“Most of the benefits of reservation allocated to Scheduled Castes have been disproportionately grabbed by a few relatively advanced communities within them, depriving a vast majority of most backward communities, particularly Madigas, of their legitimate share. The Sadashiva commission objectively studied the issue and came up with rational recommendations of redistributing reservations . However, some leaders of relatively forward communities are opposing the report on the grounds that it would be against the interests of their communities. Successive governments have time and again assured that they would adopt the report, but showed no interest in doing so owing to pressure from these forward communities,” he said.When asked, Mr. Murthy said that their decision of working against the Congress in the bypolls might favour the BJP which was also against the Sadashiva report, but they still wanted to mount pressure on the party in power.S. Mareppa, honorary president of the organisation said that they had also decided to build farmers’ movement demanding land rights to bagair hukum cultivators who had been cultivating government lands for decades for their livelihoods.MRHS State committee members Shivaraya Akkaraki, Badakunte Nagarajaiah, Hanumantha Mannapur, G. Krishna, and Shantha Kumar and others were present.
