Flaming torches pay obeisance to the sacred bull and the torchbearers pay respects to the elders and mother earth and then start a rhythmic performance with the torch as a part of the traditional ‘Seva Garidi’.The two torchbearers, one after the other, first took the lighted torch and paid obeisance to the sacred bull and carrying the lighted torch move under the animal. They went between the legs carrying the torch. They touched the earth where the sacred animal stands and then carrying the torch touched the feet of elders of the troupe and after the ritual started their performance.The performance lasts three to four hours at a stretch. Another member of the troupe is ready with strips of cloth which is dipped in oil and wrapped around the flaming torch to ensure the flame does not go off.The two torch bearers along with the sacred bull were ringed in by the other devotees beating cymbals rhythmically and singing aloud. “We narrate the Dasavatarams and other religious texts, depending upon the event,” troupe leader Urukuti Raju told The Hindu at the district-level Sankranti Sambaralu here on Wednesday.“We perform at temples and religious events and at auspicious functions like gruhapravesam , the sacred bull stays at a temple and is not used for any other purpose,” he explained. Apart from the religious events and temple functions devotees ask them to perform at their functions and bear the costs of the travel and the team.The troupe comprises devotees who are working elsewhere and have to take a break from their job to participate in the ‘Garidi’, so they have to be paid a day’s wages, Mr Raju explained.
