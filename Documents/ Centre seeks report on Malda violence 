The Union Home Ministry has sought a report from the West Bengal government over the violence at Kaliachak in State’s Malda district.The development comes three days after the incident of violence at Kaliachak that triggered communal tensions in the area.On Wednesday, the State Bharatiya Janata Party leadership raised the pitch over the issue. Party MLA Samik Lahiri, who tried to enter Kaliachak earlier in the day with a BJP delegation, was arrested and released later.A party delegation led by former State president and national secretary Rahul Sinha met Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi on the issue. Speaking to journalists, Mr Sinha said that the Governor has assured the delegation that he will inform the Centre about the developments at Malda.While 10 persons have been arrested in connection with the violence in which a mob ransacked the local police station, the BJP leaders claim that the action is “too little and too late”.Trying to derive political mileage from the issue, the BJP leadership is alleging that the attack on Kaliachak police station on Sunday was an act of “anti-national” elements who have been operating in the area for quite some time.It is also learnt that the BJP, which plans to hold a political rally at Malda later this month, will highlight the issue. A senior Central Minister or a national-level party leader is likely to address the rally.Sources within the BJP said like the accidental blasts at Khargragarh in State’s Burdwan district which revealed a web of anti-national elements operating in the State, the violence at Malda may have an insidious agenda and it is a result of ruling Trinamool Congress dealing with such elements with “velvet gloves”.
