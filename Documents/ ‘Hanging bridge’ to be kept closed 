The ‘hanging bridge’ that lends a crossover to the rocky edges for a bird’s eyeview of the gushing falls in all likelihood will be kept closed for the foreseeable future, much to the dismay of tourists.The bridge provides access to the reserve forest shared by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.View pointFor several months now, the entry to the bridge enclosure has been open to tourists only as a viewpoint.No entry is permitted to the forests or the open rocks to view the falls.According to Collector K.Vivekanandan, the bridge cannot be opened till the edges are fortified by barricades from a 10 feet distance.“The closure of the hanging bridge has made a tangible difference to casualty.Since that part falls under the Forest Act no permanent structures can be constructed,” says Mr.Vivekanandan.Sources say the decision was impelled by the reckless behaviour of several tourists at the spot.
