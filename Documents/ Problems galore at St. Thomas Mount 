The Beach – Tambaram is among the busiest of the suburban sectors in Chennai and St. Thomas Mount is an important station on it, with even a turn-back service during the morning rush hour – an indicator to the number of commuters who use the station.The station – between Guindy and Pazhavanthangal railway stations is strategically and provides quick and low cost public transport connectivity to people from Alandur, Adambakkam, Vanuvampet and West Velachery.Despite several thousand people using the station everyday, there are plenty of complaints about the overall quality of passenger amenities here.Need for more countersCommuters say ticket counters are always crowded, not just during the morning and evening rush hours. A.Raghavan, a commuter said they needed additional counters for quick purchase of tickets.Public toilets are inadequate here and the vehicle parking lot is very poorly maintained.The reason, commuters said, was the absence of a contractor.Commuters also complain that the narrow pathway leading to the station is eaten up by hawkers.Two-wheeler theftCommuters also highlighted the absence of contractors in the parking yard at the railway station posing risk of loss of vehicles. V. Rama Rao of Traffic and Transportation Forum, said instances of two-wheeler theft were common.The motorcycle of a Southern Railway was stolen before Christmas last year, he said.The vast open space near the station should be put to better use, he suggested.Commuters also complained about the last mile connectivity of poor bus facilities to reach the station.Southern Railway officials said: at present, the construction of the metro and elevated Mass Rapid Transit System works have put the station development work on hold.
