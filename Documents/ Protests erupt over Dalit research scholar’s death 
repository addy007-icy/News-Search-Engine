Anger spilled on to the streets of the city as protests erupted over the death of Rohith Vemula, a Dalit research scholar of the University of Hyderabad (UoH), who hanged himself on Sunday, 15 days after he was expelled from his hostel along with four other researchers.While students of Bangalore University’s Baba Saheb Dr. B R Ambedkar Students’ Association demonstrated on the varsity campus, the All India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO) too staged a protest, blaming the Union government for Rohith’s death. Later in the afternoon, various groups, fighting for the rights of Dalits and minorities, progressive thinkers, writers and students, along with student organisations staged a demonstration in front of Town Hall. Protestors demanded the resignation of not just Minister for Human Resources Development Smriti Irani as well as the Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao.
