To incentivise the usage of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refuelling during non-peak hours, Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) on Thursday announced a discount of Rs. 1.50 per kilogram in the selling prices across the National Capital Region (NCR).In a statement, IGL said the discount would apply between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. at 230 outlets in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad from Friday night as a New Year gift for its customers. The remaining 30 outlets will offer similar facilities soon.The move would make the consumer price of CNG Rs. 35.70 per kg in Delhi and Rs. 41.10 per kg in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad.The CNG price during 5 a.m. to 12 a.m. at these select stations, as well as a few stations where this discount is not been offered, remains unchanged at Rs 37.20 per kg in Delhi and Rs 42.60 per kg in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, the statement said.“This first-of-its kind initiative by IGL is aimed at providing comfortable fuelling experience to its customers and also ensuring effective utilisation of its CNG refuelling infrastructure during off peak hours.Due to increased environmental awareness and exemption of CNG run cars from odd-even rule in Delhi, the demand for CNG in the region is expected to grow with more vehicles, especially private cars, expected to run on CNG,” the statement added.The statement added that to promote conversion of private cars to CNG, a CNG kit retrofitment scheme is also being been rolled out through ICICI Bank, which would offer payment for CNG kit retrofitment through easy instalments.The discount will apply between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m. at 230 outlets in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad from Friday night
