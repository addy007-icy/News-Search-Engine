The Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) has demanded that the State government release a white paper on the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation scheme to allay apprehensions among farmers.The government should take steps to ensure that farmers were paid adequate compensation for foregoing their lands and transparency should be maintained in the project implementation.TDP polit bureau member Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy expressed concern over the repeated orders being issued by the government on change in project design as this could lead to confrontation between the farmers of adjacent districts.The frequent changes in the project design had ensured that the estimated cost of the project had increased from Rs. 25,000 crore to Rs. 40,000 crore. The secrecy maintained on the project, which by and large remained on paper thus far, and the frequent government orders released in this regard were creating confusion among farmers.Alleging that over 2,000 farmers had committed suicide in the State since the TRS government took over the reins, he urged Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan to console the families and direct the government to take steps to adequately compensate the bereaved families. It was unfortunate that the Governor had not responded to the spree of suicides by farmers in spite of being the constitutional head of the State.The Governor had also not responded to the violation of model code of conduct by the TRS government in the ongoing campaign for the GHMC. The administrative machinery too was acting hand in glove with the ruling dispensation and was cooperating with the TRS leaders in violating the election code, he said.
