Wearing a new dress for the greatest day of his life, Wazir Naikodi was embracing his fellow inmates, with emotion and jubilation.“It is no less than a festival for me; perhaps, the biggest of my life. However, I also pray never to see such festival again in my life,” he said.Wazir Naikodi was among the 38 inmates who were released from the District Central Prison here on the basis of good conduct during their jail term.Speaking to The Hindu inside the jail before being released, he said that he was just 18 when he came to jail on the charge of murder, and was now being released after serving 17 years of sentence.“A few minutes of anger took away my 17 years of life. If I had controlled my emotion for a few moments, I would not have been wasting precious years of my life in jail,” he said, with a choked voice.He said that he has no idea how he is going to start his new life after the release. He, however, wishes to take up a business.Sharing his experience, he said that each day was emotionally agonising and reminded him of the horrific moment of the crime he committed. He said that he would ensure good education for his two children and raise them as good human beings.Arun Kumar Ramanna, native of Bhadravati taluk of Shivamogga district, felt that in view of the enormity of his crime, he should have been serving more years in jail.“This I have felt after regularly attending the meditation programme conducted by Om Shanti, spiritual organisation at the prison,” he said.Arun Kumar Ramanna, who was also convicted in a murder case, said that he was 29 when he committed the crime. After serving term in prisons in Shivamogga and Bengaluru, he was shifted here about six years ago.“The preaching has taught me the value of life,” he and vowed never to kill even an ant in his life.
