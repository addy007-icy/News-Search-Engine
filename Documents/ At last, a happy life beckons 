A compassionate act of a town-based social worker has not only helped a 60-year-old person of Karimnagar district, who until over a year ago wandered aimlessly across the district, regain his mental health, but also paved the way for his reunion with his family after nearly a one-and-a-half decade.According to sources, B. Rajamallu of Mutharam in Peddapalli mandal of Karimnagar district, had gone missing from home around 15 years ago.After all their attempts to trace him proved futile, his family members presumed him dead. They had even reportedly performed funeral of an unidentified body, recovered in Karimnagar district, assuming it to be that of their missing family head a few years ago, sources said.Rajamallu was found wandering the streets in Khammam by Annam Srinivasa Rao, a social worker and the vice-president of Lions Club of Khammam Platinum, more than a year ago.Mr. Rao rescued him, provided him with medical care and got him admitted in the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) at Erragadda in Hyderabad with the help of the local police. Rajamallu regained memory gradually after treatment. On his discharge from the IMH, he took shelter in the house of Srinivasa Rao and informed him about his native place in Karimnagar district.Srinivasa Rao traced the exact address of Rajamalluâ€™s family members with the help of the Lions Club representatives in Peddapalli. Rajamallu will meet his family members in the presence of police officials concerned in Peddapalli on Friday, says Srinivasa Rao.
