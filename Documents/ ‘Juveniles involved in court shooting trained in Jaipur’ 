Tyagi made the arrests while three others including Jamaluddin, Asim and Mohd Ajim are absconding, said Mr. Gurjar.While the three arrested men were lodged in jail, the absconding accused carried out the operation on the ground, which involved training of the juveniles and conducting a reconnaissance of the court premises.“Jamaluddin provided money and weapons to the syndicate of Delhi.
