The former Bihar Chief Minister, Rabri Devi, has criticised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for adopting double standards in its approach and asked elder members of the organisation, if they weren’t ashamed to “come out in public wearing half-pants.” She also questioned RSS members attacking the RJD for its lathi rally when they themselves carry lathis [sticks].“What type of organisation is the RSS in which even old people wear knickers… don’t they feel ashamed of coming out in public wearing half-pants?,” said Ms. Devi, while addressing the 9th triennial open session of the RJD’s national council in Patna on Sunday.Party delegates from 21 States attended the meeting in which her husband Lalu Prasad was re-elected party president for the ninth consecutive term.“RSS men themselves carry lathis. Then why do they and the BJP leaders term the RJD ‘lathi mein tel pilawan party [party that puts oil on sticks]’,” asked Ms. Devi.“If it is a practice for RSS men to carry lathis in their daily training camps, then why do they mock the RJD when its workers were asked to come to a rally with lathis in Patna?”Ms. Devi called upon the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) leaders to remain united. “If you remain united, the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance government will continue for 20 years in Bihar,” she said.The former Bihar CM advised party leaders and workers not to raise internal issues before the media or outside the party forum.Ms. Devi also referred to the recent controversy over Mr. Prasad issuing instruction to health officials, doctors and making “surprise inspection” of government-run hospitals, and said, “Laluji has every right to inquire about people’s problems.”
