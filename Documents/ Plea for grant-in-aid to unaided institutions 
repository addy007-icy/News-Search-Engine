Members of the Association of Teachers, Staff and Managements of Unaided Schools/Colleges in Karnataka have appealed to the State government to extend grant-in aid. State unit president Jalamangala Nagaraju said the government is neglecting teachers and staff of 280 unaided institutions, who are working for a meagre salary.He said, “We have been staging a dharna near Freedom Park since January 4 asking the government to fulfil our long-pending demands. But, no government representative has come forward to hear us out.”He said the government should ensure that grant-in aid is extended to all unaided Kannada schools and colleges started after 1995, and also extend all facilities that are being given to government schools and colleges to unaided Kannada schools and colleges in the State to help teachers and students.
