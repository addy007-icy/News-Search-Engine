Nearly a year after district authorities took away their community forest rights (CFR) titles to rectify an error, villages in Gondia district have still not got them back.On December 5, 2015, representatives of 10 villages of Devri and Sadakarjuni talukas wrote to the district and forest authorities requesting them to return their titles.“Between March and September 2012, 10 CFR titles were given in the name of gram panchayats,” the letter stated. “However, from January to February 2015, they were taken back from us on the assurance that they will be re-allotted in the name of gram sabhas. Eight months have passed, but the titles have not been returned. This has created hurdles in planning schemes for protection of forests and development of the villages.”The titles in the two talukas, which have 50 per cent adivasi population, were given for an approximate area of 22,700 hectares. About 43 per cent of area in Gondia has forest cover.“So far, the government has given titles in 840 villages in Gondia. Palandur village got the first title in 2008,” Geetanjoy Sahu from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences pointed out at a workshop on CSR on Sunday. “But these titles were given without mapping the land and forest resources. The people were not even aware why these titles were given.”Mr Sahu pointed out that the titles were given with conditions marking portions of land for grazing, for water bodies and cremation grounds. In the neighbouring Gadchiroli, villages of Madia Gond adivasis are moving towards ensuring their habitat rights, including mountains and places of worship, which are linked to their traditional practices.
