The organisational reshuffle of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has yet again proved the clout former State president V.Muraleedharan continues to wield in the State unit of the party.Almost all leaders who owe allegiance to Mr.Muraleedharan have been accommodated by the national leadership and some of them, most prominently, M.S. Kumar, who have fallen from grace, have been left out from the list of office-bearers released by incumbent Kummanam Rajasekharan on Sunday.According to party sources, the camaraderie which witnessed following a change of guard in the State leadership is on the wane and chances of some of the prominent leaders of yesteryears such as K. Raman Pillai and P.P. Mukundan returning to the State unit are too bleak.Whether the reorganisation would augur well for the party, especially in the wake of the Assembly election, remains to be seen.NSS factorFor, the party does not enjoy cordial relations with the Nair Service Society (NSS) and the parleys with certain denominations of the Christian community have not yet crystallised too.The NSS had openly spelt out its discontent with certain leaders and that has to be addressed again. Though the leadership had been dithering about the reshuffle before the election, ultimately it decided to take a call on it and announced the list.Rival factionsMost of the leaders of the rival factions headed by both Mr.Muraleedharan and another former president P.K. Krishnadas have found their way into the list, but the list shows that it is heavily weighed in favour of the former.RSS behestShoba Surendran who had openly come out against Mr.Muraleedharan’s leadership is understood to have been accommodated at the behest of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The State leadership was sore over her dissident activities and that too at the peak of the local government elections, ignoring the repeated warnings of the party national leadership and the RSS State leadership.Dominant sectionA dominant section in the party holds that the reorganisation has been done to humour the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) leadership and that would have serious bearing on the party’s relations with other communities like the NSS which had been supporting it earlier.Much more than the incumbent, the onus is now on Mr.Muraleedharan and his cohorts to ensure an impressive performance in the election.
