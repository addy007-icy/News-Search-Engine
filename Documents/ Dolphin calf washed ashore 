A dead Risso’s dolphin calf was washed ashore on the Alambarai Kuppam beach, near Marakanam, on Friday.Volunteers of the Sea Turtle Protection Force from the TREE Foundation received a call from residents near the area who spotted the dead animal.They identified it as a Risso’s Dolphin based on the furrow on its head, which is said to be the most striking feature of the species.“The dolphin could not have been more than a few days old as it only measured 142 cm in length. Deep marks were found near the blow hole area of the dolphin, which indicated that it might have got caught in a net,” said Supraja Dharini of TREE Foundation.Following an examination of the dolphin, the volunteers buried it 30 metres above the high-tide line.
