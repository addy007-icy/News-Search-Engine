The move to inaugurate the second nine-storey annexe to the government Secretariat without mandatory clearances, including that of the city Corporation, and without completion of electrical and plumbing work has raised eyebrows.The government has decided to open the building before the announcement of the elections to the Assembly and has fixed January13 as the tentative date for the inauguration.Yet to get NOCInformation collected through RTI from the House Keeping (B) wing of the General Administration Department said the second annexe was yet to get the No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services.Inquiry by The Hindu revealed that the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services had not been approached till date for the NOC.Official sources said the building did not have the setback prescribed in the Kerala Municipal Building Rules (KMBR), and movement of fire tenders through the sides of high-rise building in case of an emergency like blaze would be difficult.The second annexe has come up on 131 cents of land adjacent to the first annexe and close to the Cantonment (north) gate of the Secretariat.It is mainly to overcome the space constraints and parking problems on the sprawling main premises facing the arterial road and the present annexe.In full swingAlthough the work is on in full swing, the electrical and plumbing works is unlikely to be completed before January 13. The connectivity between the two annexes for the hassle-free movement of the personnel and the visitors without stepping onto the busy road also remains in paper.The air conditioning units installed in the annexe were the one purchased for the National Games held last year, sources said.The estimate of the building executed through the PWD’s Special Building section has also crossed Rs.40 crore.The estimate for the building whose works started in 2011 has gone up by another Rs.10 crore.Moves are also on at the bureaucratic level to get the TC from city Corporation without submitting the NOC and the completion report.The two lakh-sq ft building was initially to house the finance and taxes wing, a sub-treasury and three clinics – modern medicine, ayurveda and homoeopathy – to cater to the health needs of the 5,000-odd Secretariat employees, and a canteen.But, the government move to house the Home Department has come in for flak.The basement and the ground floor are for parking and 140-150 cars can be parked on the new premises.The building is a blend of modern and traditional Kerala architecture.January13 fixed tentatively for the inaugurationAnnexe is a two lakh-sq.ft building on 131 cents of land
