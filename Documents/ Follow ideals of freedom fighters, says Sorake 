Vinay Kumar Sorake, Urban Development Minister, said on Tuesday that people should remember the sacrifices of the freedom fighters and follow their ideals. He was speaking at the 67th Republic Day celebrations organised by the district administration at the newly constructed Mahatma Gandhi Bayalu Ranga Mandira at Beedinagudde, here.He also inaugurated the Bayalu Ranga Mandira, constructed by the Udupi City Municipal Council (CMC) at a cost of Rs. 98 lakh, on the occasion.Since the model code of conduct is in force for the zilla and taluk panchayat elections, Mr. Sorake’s speech had no new announcements or mention of developmental works. Instead it was focused fully on the freedom struggle and making of the Constitution.Mr. Sorake said that it was on January 26, 1950, that the country adopted its Constitution. The Constitution had declared the country as a Sovereign Democratic Republic. “It is our duty to celebrate the Republic Day in a meaningful manner,” he said.The Constitution provided guidelines for successful functioning of a democratic system and emphasized on the welfare of all citizens. The adoption of the Constitution was the one of the most important steps after the country gained Independence on August 15, 1947.Since the Indian National Congress which was spearheading the freedom movement had declared “Purna Swaraj” for the country on January 26, 1930, it was decided to adopt the Constitution on January 26, 1950, to commemorate the 1930 declaration.It was under the leadership of stalwarts of the freedom movement such as Rajendra Prasad and B.R. Ambedkar that the biggest and most systematic constitution in the world was produced.
