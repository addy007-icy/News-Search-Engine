Activists of peasants’ organisation All-India Krantikari Krusak Sabha (AIKKS) alleged that tribals were being exploited and terrorised in rural pockets of Ganjam.The Ganjam unit of AIKKS held demonstration outside the office of the Deputy Inspector General of police in Berhampur on Wednesday.AIKKS representatives, including Ganjam district secretary Sankar Sahu, met DIG Amitabh Thakur and discussed their complaints. Mr Sahu alleged that despite several complaints, the police were not taking any action against those involved in exploitation of tribals.As per the organisation on December 23, 2015, a group of miscreants had reached tribal village Dimiripalli under Jagannathprasad police station on four wheelers and bikes. They then tried to take possession of a cashew orchard in the area, which is a source of livelihood of local tribals, alleged Mr Sahu.According to AIKKS leaders, the police have not taken any action. AIKKS Buguda block leader Balabhadra Mallik cited instances from his block like attack on tribal women by miscreants of higher castes at Kandarai village and terrorisation of tribals at Nimapalli and Samalei villages.Miscreants had also resorted to bombing at Rampo village under Tarsingh police station to terrorise the tribals, said Mr Sahu. As per the AIKKS, these terror tactics are being used by miscreants to take over jungle land and cashew plantations being utilised by landless tribals for their livelihood.The organisation has decided to take up agitation if no action is taken to protect rights of tribals.“Despite several complaints, the police were not taking any action against the accused”
