Sugarcane growers are planning to hold a rally outside the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru seeking clearance of sugarcane dues worth Rs. 4,500 crore.Kurubur Shanthkumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association, said that they would organise a ‘Vidhana Soudha Chalo’ agitation if the government did not clear the dues within 20 days.He told presspersons here on Thursday that Rs. 3,500 crore was due for the crushing season 2015-16 and Rs. 1,000 crore was due for the 2014-15 season. The mill owners had not paid it despite agitations by growers and promises by the government. It had prompted farmers to commit suicide, Mr. Shanthkumar alleged. He criticised Minister for Cooperation H.S. Mahadev Prasad for delaying the fixing of sugarcane price, even though the Centre had announced the Fair and Remunerative Price.“The Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments have announced Rs. 2,800 a tonne for sugarcane. Karnataka is not taking a decision only to protect the interests of sugar mills controlled by politicians belonging to the Congress and the BJP,” Mr. Shanthkumar said.He said that if the government did not have funds, it should seize 20,000 tonnes of gold lying idle in temples across the country, which would fetch Rs. 50 billion crore. That could be invested for boosting agriculture and farmers’ income, Mr. Shanthkumar said.Earlier, he handed over a cheque for Rs. 2.53 lakh through Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram to the bereaved family of Vitthal Arabhavi of Kankanwadi of Raibag taluk, a sugarcane grower who committed suicide at a protest site in front of the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha when the winter session of the legislature was being held in Belagavi on November 26, 2013. The amount, contributed by the farmers of Shivamogga district, was handed over to the widow and two sons of the deceased farmer.
