The yield in potato farms, where certified seeds were sown, is better, compared to the fields where non-certified seeds were sown, said B. Suma, Deputy Director of Horticulture, here on Monday. Earlier, the department had procured certified seed potatoes and distributed them among 63 select farmers in the district.Speaking to presspersons here, Ms. Suma said that certified seed potatoes were sown in 63 farms, where irrigation facility was available. “Owing to excess rainfall, the crop was washed away in three of those farms. In the remaining 60 farms, the yield has been good. For every bag of seed potatoes, the yield was six to seven bags. However, in fields where non-certified seed potatoes were sown, the yield was around three to four bags,” he said.A. Manju, Minister for Sericulture, Animal Husbandry, and in-charge of Hassan district, announced recently that the district administration had decided to procure a large quantity of certified seed potatoes this year for distribution among potato growers.
