Simple themes and clear expression have earned city-based artist Kurma Venkata Siva Prasad an unprecedented recognition from the Art Revolution Taipei-2016 — he has been asked to send 30 works to be displayed and sold there.An estimated 4,033 pieces of artworks by artists from 78 countries were submitted for the 2015 International Artist Grand Prize Competition organised by the Taiwan International Contemporary Association.Champion of ART-2015, Prasad has been commissioned to create 30 works for display at the ART-2016 at Taipei, where he would be given five booths to display his works at the international art expo to be conducted at the World Trade Centre in Taipei from April 21 to 25.“The jury and the director of the art show have been impressed by some of the works that I proposed to send for the expo this year, and they asked me to work on some themes,” Prasad told The Hindu .“Art lovers and collectors have been known to buy most of the works on display at the art show, which is a recognition in itself,” he said.He is scheduled to send the 30 acrylic on canvas works to Taiwan by the end of the month.It took him over seven months to work on the themes and paintings.The choice of vibrant colours and clear lines make Prasad’s symbolic works stand out. The series of contemporary artworks focus on village women and village life and traditional musical instruments.“My training under ‘Kala’ Appa Rao of Kala Arts while painting signboards during my initial years helped me in my visualisation and gave me a command over the brush. With over three-decade experience in handling a brush, I am comfortable using it for the fine lines unlike most artists who use a pen,” he explained. Since most of my works are bought by collectors, I try to work on themes and use colours that have a greater acceptance so that the piece of art gives the collector joy every time he or she looks at it, he said.Art Revolution Taipei askscity-based artist Prasad to send30 works for display and sale
