The controversy over the conduct of examinations at the Ernakulam Maharaja’s College took a new turn on Monday with a section of students launching an indefinite hunger strike at the college gates.As many as seven activists of the Students Federation of India led by Rohit Ajay, a third-year B.A. student and chairman of the College union, resorted to the protest citing a delay on the part of the college authorities in completing the syllabus and conducting the first semester examination once again. The issue pertains to the boycott of examinations by about 600 of the 690 first semester students here last month, who had cited that the teachers had failed to complete the syllabus in many subjects.“The college authority had guaranteed to lecture the left-out portion after a joint inquiry committee completed an investigation into the issue. The committee submitted its report about a week ago, but a decision with regard to commencing the classes is yet to be made,” Rohit said .The panel, supervised by the college Principal and comprising the college union chairman, general secretary and first-year degree representative in its report, termed the demands raised by the students justifiable, he claimed.The college authorities, however, said any decision with regard to rescheduling the classes and the examinations would have to be taken by the college governing council. “We completed 65 class days during this semester and all the core papers have been fully covered. However, only about 15 per cent of the total students appeared for the examination .Any further decision on rescheduling the exams will have to be taken at the governing council,” explained N.L. Beena, college Principal.Meanwhile, the teachers are divided over the issue with majority of them opposed to the idea. They have demanded that a decision should be taken only after proper inquiry.
