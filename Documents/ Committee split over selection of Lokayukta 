The panel, headed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, is split over selecting the next Lokayukta. The final name to be forwarded to the Governor is yet to emerge with members having varied opinions, according to those involved in the selection process.At the meeting held on Monday, Mr. Siddaramaiah and Legislative Assembly Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa backed the candidature of Chairman of the Karnataka Law Commission S.R. Nayak, while other members favoured Vikramjit Sen, who retired as the Supreme Court judge on December 31.Members, who attended the meeting, said that acting Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka Subhro Kamal Mukherjee was the first to suggest the candidature of Mr. Sen as he has an impeccable record. Supporting Mr. Mukherjee’s move, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Jagadish Shettar, his counterpart in the Council K.S. Eshwarappa, and Council Chairman D.H. Shankaramurthy also supported Mr. Sen’s candidature.It is said that the BJP defended the name recommended by Mr. Mukherjee on the ground that only a reputed legal luminary can lift the image of the Lokayukta institution, whose image was dented in the recent past following alleged corruption.The Chief Minister and Mr. Thimmappa, however, preferred Mr. Nayak since the former had worked in the State and was well-versed with the local language and State machinery.CM, Assembly Speaker back candidature of law commission chief S.R.
