Two days after the Centre declassified 100 files relating to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, his grand-nephew and convenor of Open Platform for Netaji, Chandra Kumar Bose, on Monday joined the BJP. Mr. Bose, who since 2012 has been leading the movement for declassification of Netaji files joined the BJP at a rally where party national president Amit Shah was present.The 55-year-old economics graduate from London took the BJP flag from Mr. Shah in the presence of senior leaders of the State unit of the party. While speculation is rife that the Bose scion may get the party ticket in the coming Assembly polls, Mr. Bose told The Hindu that he was ready for any responsibility.“I am not the first person in the Bose family to join the BJP. My father Amiya Nath Bose in the 1980s was associated with the BJP,” he said. Chandra Kumar Bose, who debunked the theory that Netaji died in the air crash on August 18, 1945, was critical of the Congress and accused the party of “doing injustice to Netaji.”“I believe that it is only the BJP that can realise the vision of Netaji, Swami Vivekananda and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. The Congress has taken the country far from their vision,” Mr. Bose said.
