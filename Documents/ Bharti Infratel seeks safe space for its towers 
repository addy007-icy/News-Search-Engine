Bharti Infratel Limited (BIL), a leading telecom infrastructure services company, has sought allocation of land nearer to either police stations or camps of paramilitary forces to erect telephone tower after its communication infrastructures have been increasingly attacked by the Left wing extremists in Odisha.Expressing concern over repeated blasts near its towers, the BIL said that the attacks caused huge financial losses to the company, besides adversely affecting the needs of the common mass and posing security threat to its employees.The company said since 2010, the Naxals triggered as many as 12 blasts and five of those were in 2015. The company has suffered major losses in Koraput district, as 11 out of 12 blasts have taken place here.On December 20 last year, two of its towers at Chipakur and Kalaital under Boipariguda police station limit of Koraput district were blown up. As many as three towers were in 2010 while last year saw the number of attacks going up.All these blasts occurred under the Boipariguda police station limit where two BSF personnel were killed in a landmine blast on Friday.“Thefts at battery banks, copper cable, galvanised iron strips and diesel from generators are reported every month leading to operational disaster. It appears organised gangsters are operating throughout the State,” the company noted in the letter to the Home Department.“Space may be allotted in these Naxal-affected areas inside or near police stations or stations of paramilitary units,” BIL urged, asking for immediate discussion with officials on the issue.Seeking round-the-clock patrolling near telecom towers, the company said, “We may require police support at different point of times for guarding our towers at certain critical and strategic locations for a brief period till such critical sites is restored to normalcy”. The State government had identified 253 sites in the districts affected by the Left wing extremism those remained to be connected through telecom and telephony network. Telecom towers have been prime targets of extremists as they fear good mobile communication network would adversely impact their movement.Of the 12 attacks on BIL’s telecom towers, 11 have taken place in Koraput district
