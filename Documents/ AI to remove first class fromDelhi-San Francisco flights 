Owing to low occupancy, national carrier Air India has decided to do away with the first class cabin on its Delhi-San Francisco non-stop flight — barely a month after it began operations on the route.Air India officials said the airline will change the configuration of its B777-200LR aircraft to add more economy class seats which has higher demand.“The passenger load factor in the first class cabin is only 20-25 per cent, while there has been a pickup in the demand for business class seats by 30-35 per cent since the launch. We have decided to add more seats in the economy cabin,” a senior AI official said.At present, the aircraft has eight first class seats, 35 business and 195 economy class seats on this route. The new configuration will see 298 economy class seats. The first class cabin was used by chief executives of top business houses and witnessed a low demand, an official added.The airline operates all the three B777-200 LRs on the Delhi-San Francisco route. Air India began operations on the route in December making it the first direct flight between India and the U.S. west coast, covering the distance in 17 hours. The Air India also flies non-stop daily flights to Chicago, New York and Newark.
