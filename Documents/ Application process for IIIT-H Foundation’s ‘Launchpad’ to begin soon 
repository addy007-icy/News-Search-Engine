The application process for the IIIT-H Foundation’s ‘Launchpad’ programme for early stage technology start-ups will begin in the first week of February.A co-working space, Launchpad is for helping start-ups building their MVP’s (minimum viable products) and/or gearing up to release their products into the market. The Foundation, known as Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, said this on Monday while announcing a shift in the focus from being a business incubator to deeper technologies gearing up to work in the areas of deep learning and AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality) products and solutions. The first batch of deep tech start-ups will start working from the incubator in March. The incubator offers ‘Tech Propellor’, a programme for growth stage startups. The Foundation, which has funded 13 start-ups in the past through under different schemes, in the coming months would search for 3-6 more startups to invest in. It is in discussion with various angel networks, a press release said.
