A group of over 150 moulvis and heads of mosques and madarsas across the State held a meeting at Idgah grounds on Sunday to discuss the arrest of moulvi Anzar Sha Khasmi, and decided to extend legal help for his release.The group also decided to submit a representation to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Home Minister G. Parameshwara seeking their intervention for a fair probe.Expressing doubt over his arrest procedures, the members said the Delhi police linking him to the terrorist outfit was not reasonable. “We do not support anti-national activities and the manner in which he was arrested and portrayed as a terror suspect merely on suspicion is very disturbing,” Syed Shafiulla, convener of the meeting, said. Even the city Police Commissioner admitted that they did not have information pointing to his involvement in anti-national activities, they said.His arrest has caused resentment among the youth of the community and we have appealed to them to keep calm, while legal course to secure Khasmi’s release will start at the earliest, they added.
