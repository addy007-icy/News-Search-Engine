BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday held a meeting with all Ministers of Rajasthan government, the first such interaction where they reportedly discussed progress of the Central and the State schemes. Mr. Shah was received at the airport by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the party’s State president Ashok Parnami.On a query whether it would be a review of Rajasthan Ministers’ performance in the last two years, Mr. Paranmi on Tuesday said: “The meeting will take its own course. It’s difficult to predict. Of course, the central and state governments’ development schemes could be on focal points.”Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition (Congress) Rameshwar Dudi took a jibe at the BJP president over the visit saying that it showed the Chief Minister has lost the trust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. - PTI
