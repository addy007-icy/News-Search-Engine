Adivasis owing allegiance to various organisations staged a protest against the celebration of the New Year by wearing black badges in Bhadrachalam on Friday.According to sources, the protest was organised as per the call given by the Jharkhand-based Akhila Bharata Adivasi Mahasabha to express dissent against the “imperialist cultural offensive” on the centuries-old rich Adivasi culture and traditions.Several activists of the Adivasi Sankshema Parishad (ASP), Konda Reddi Sangham, Nayakpod Seva Sangham and some other organisations participated in the demonstration held in front of the office of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) in the temple town.The ASP coordinator Madivi Nehru and other Adivasi leaders led the “black-badge campaign.”The protesters shouted slogans denouncing the celebration of New Year terming it as a “detrimental practice” being promoted as part of “invasive western tradition” and capitalist consumerism.As the ITDA office was closed on account of holiday declared by the State government, the activists visited the Youth Training Centre and the Nutritional Rehabilitation Centre on the premises of the ITDA headquarters.They urged the Adivasi employees to become active partners in the campaign to save the distinctive cultural heritage of Adivasis from the onslaught of ‘cultural imperialism’.
