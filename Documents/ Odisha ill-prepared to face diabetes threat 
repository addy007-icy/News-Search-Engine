Even though nine per cent of Odisha’s total population is estimated to be living with diabetes, the State government is yet to structure a suitable public health response leaving a large chunk of population to remain outside the scope of diabetic care.Health and Family Welfare Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak recently informed the Assembly that 9 per cent of the State’s total population was estimated to be diabetics and the government was trying to train general physicians and paramedical staff for the same.However, the State does not have more than 20 diabetologists and endocrinologists and 200 general physicians, who have undergone short-term refresher’s course to see diabetic cases.“We require doctors to write 1.6 crore prescriptions annually if 40 lakh diabetics of the State are to be given proper care. But with the present strength of diabetologists and trained physicians, barely 15 lakh prescriptions are generated,” said Alok Kanungo, chairman and managing director of Kanungo Institute of Diabetes Specialities (KIDS), eastern India’s largest diabetes hospital here on Sunday.Dr. Kanungo said under National Programme For Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke (NPCDCS), around 2.4 lakh people having diabetes were detected in four backward districts in Nuapada, Kalahandi, Bolangir and Bargarh.The State government does not have any arrangement in public health care institutions in these four districts to provide universal diabetic care. Moreover, there have been no proper diagnostic centres to do basic tests required to detect symptom of diabetes.“Many people with diabetes are able to prevent or delay the onset of complications if patients are provided proper care and doctor’s advice. It is necessary for the government to understand that if diabetes is not controlled at primary level, the patients upon experiencing health complications will add burden to skeletal public super-speciality care,” he pointed out.Apart from shortage of doctors, inadequate dieticians and other paramedical staffs also make things complicated.The State government must provide refresher’s course to MBBS and AYUSH doctors so that they could start to handle diabetes at primary level and trained diabetologists and endocrinologists would take care of cases with complications.
