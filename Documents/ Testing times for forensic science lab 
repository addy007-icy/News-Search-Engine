Shortage of manpower including trained investigators coupled with lack of new tools and technologies at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) housed at the premises of the Kirumambakkam police station on the city’s outskirts is hampering the lab in carrying out routine and crucial testing of samples for speedy investigation.The Forensic Science Laboratory was established in 2013 under the Police Modernisation Programme by the Central Government on a request from the territorial government.Slow progressThe Centre had sanctioned Rs. 8 crore for the lab to be equipped with the latest facilities. However, the Centre released only Rs.3.5 crore so far due to slow progress in providing the required facilities by the Government.“The FSL is an important link in investigation of crimes such as theft, accident and murders. However, the major challenge is the shortage of new technologies and Forensic divisions.At present the FSL has only Biology and Serology labs and as many as eight important divisions including DNA, Fingerprint, Chemistry, Documents and Photography have not been established so far,” a senior official on anonymity told The Hindu .A proposal sent by the Department to the Puducherry Government to expedite the establishment of DNA and Chemistry divisions is gathering dust for the past one year. The Department is pursuing the matter with the authorities.Major hurdleThe major hurdle arises out of a senior official holding additional charge of the post of coordinator in the Forensic Science Development Board headed by the Chief Secretary.The official has not been able to do justice to both the departments and the FSL has been getting a raw deal, the official said.The FSL requires as many as 27 permanent staff including Joint Director, junior analysts and Finger print experts. But no recruitments have been made and the works are being carried out by personnel engaged on contract basis.The FSL doest not have a triangular microscope which is an important part of scientific investigation.According to sources, the FSL receives around 30 cases on an average related to fingerprints, cybercrime and murder.Due to want of facilities cases that required forensic testing are sent to Chennai and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in Hyderabad.Delay of resultsWith both the centre having a backlog of cases there has been a delay before the results are obtained.The government has already been approached for development of infrastructure and buildings. Although a site has been allotted for establishment of a two-storey structure for FSL in the campus of the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital at Rs.5 crore the works are yet to commence, an official said.
