A day after Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad ‘inspected’ Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) here to take stock of its infrastructure and facilities, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday sought an “explanation” from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the issue.In what capacity did the RJD supremo ‘inspect’ the IGIMS and was briefed by the officials, he asked, adding, the Chief Minister “owes an explanation” over it.Mr Prasad had ‘inspected’ the IGIMS at Sheikhpura in the State Capital on Sunday and was briefed by its officials about the infrastructure and facilities.‘Two power centres’His activism proved that there were “two centres of power in Bihar’s Grand Alliance government”, the senior BJP leader alleged.“The RJD chief’s advisory to the Chief Minister on law and order situation and visit to the IGIMS make one believe that Mr Kumar holds the crown on his head, but it is Lalu Prasad who calls the shots in the government,” Mr Modi said.The former Deputy Chief Minister accused Mr Prasad of “usurping” the duty of his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who is the Health Minister, by inspecting the premier medical institution and “issuing directive to the officials of the department”.‘Reluctant Minister’Referring to Tej Pratap’s absence from previous Assembly session on health grounds, he alleged, the Minister appeared to be a “reluctant Minister” not bothering to reply to questions by lawmakers.Mr Modi charged the RJD chief with “harbouring greed for power”, and said that if it was possible Mr Prasad would not “mind taking part in Cabinet meetings too”.Amid alleged spurt in crime graph, the BJP leader accused the Chief Minister of failing on law and order front and said Mr Prasad was indirectly reminding Mr Kumar about his status as “junior leader” to him. -- PTI
