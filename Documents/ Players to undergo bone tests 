The fate of the second semifinal of the Harris Shield Inter-School U-16 (Elite) Cricket Tournament hangs in the balance.But following the firm opinion of the Cricket Improvements Committee (CIC) of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), the Mumbai School Sports Association (MSSA) has decided to conduct bone tests for the players against whom both Rizvi Springfield (Bandra) and Swami Vivekanand International School (Borivali) have lodged a protest.An MSSA official monitoring the alleged “age-fudging” episodes by a handful of schools, said that letters have been sent to the two schools to deposit money (refundable) with the association for conducting the bone tests at a government hospital next Monday (February 1). “Four players of the Rizvi Springfield did not clear the BCCI’s TW3 bone tests, and they are not part of the team. But there are two doubtful cases in the team and a large number from Swami Vivekanand. Once the results are out, the MSSA and MCA can meet and find a way forward for the second semifinal,” said the official.As of now, only Don Bosco (Matunga) is certain to play the semifinal; if the players of both schools are found to be over-aged, then there is a possibility of a lower-placed team in the particular group playing the semifinal. “The MSSA usually suspends the teams itself should they violate rules. The priority now is to get the bone tests done.”A meeting of the MSSA officials and MCA scheduled on Wednesday was put off with the former deciding to proceed with bone tests. It is understood that the government hospitals follow the TW2 method, whereas the BCCI follows TW3 method.MCA vice-president and CIC chairman Dileep Vengsarkar told The Hindu that only those who clear the bone tests should be eligible to represent Mumbai in the under-16 tournaments.The practice thus far has been that players/schools submit birth and school-leaving certificates as proof of birth. But there have been instances of players producing multiple birth certificates and other documents, and hence the BCCI makes it mandatory for U-16 players to undergo the TW3 bone test. “The trend now is that players do not play the U-16 tournaments and come directly for the U-19 tournaments for which they have to produce only documents,” said an official.
