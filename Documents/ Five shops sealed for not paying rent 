Five shops in Yeshwantpur commercial complex were sealed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for not paying rent for nearly five years.According to a communiqué on Saturday, though the owners claimed that they had remitted old rental rates, the BBMP officials said that several notices under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, had been issued asking them to pay rents as per the revised rates, but many had not complied with it.After the shops were sealed, the owners gave cheques for Rs. 98,000, while one shop owner assured the BBMP of submitting a demand draft for the pending rent on Monday. During an inspection of the complex by the BBMP’s Standing Committee for markets, it was found that several shops were sub-leased by the original allottees. Committee chairperson M. Gayathri directed the officials to take action against the original allottees as under the KMC Act, besides calling for a tender for maintenance of parking space.
