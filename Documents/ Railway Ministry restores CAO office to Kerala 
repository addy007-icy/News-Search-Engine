Bowing to pressure from the State government and following an agitation by MPs from Kerala, the Railway Ministry has restored the office of Chief Administrative Officer, Construction, in Kochi. It was shifted to Allahabad last year.The Chief Minister’s Office on Thursday received a communication from the Union Railway Ministry intimating the restoration of the office in Kochi, official sources said.But, the Railways had not posted the personnel to the post of the CAO vested with ample administrative and financial powers to take up development works in the two railway divisions.The Railway Board’s decision to shift the office of the CAO from Kochi had invoked widespread protest. It was feared that it would further slow down development works, especially the doubling of tracks via Kottayam and Alappuzha, and diversion of funds earmarked for the State.The Railways took the decision when works to the tune of Rs.600 crore were progressing. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had also personally taken up the issue with Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu. Mr. Chandy had pointed out that the shifting of the CAO post had affected the liaison between state and railways. At the meeting of the MPs convened by General Manager, Southern Railway, Vashishta Johri, in the capital earlier this month, Congress MPs took it up and walked out saying that the assurance given to the Chief Minister to restore the office in Kochi was not adhered to.The officer was posted in 2012 to expedite development of the railway network in Kerala. It was made to contain the clamour from all quarters for the creation of an exclusive rail zone for Kerala and as a solace for agreeing to bifurcate Palakkad Railway Division to create Salem division.The post of the CAO, Construction, is equivalent to that of Additional General Manager and above Divisional Railway Managers of Thiruvananthapuram and Palakkad.
