: The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Thursday conceded in the Delhi High Court that the Rs. 50,000 fine for violating dust control norms was “not a deterrent” for big construction firms and said it would take steps to shut down projects violating norms from now.DPCC also submitted its action plan for tackling the issue of poor air quality, in which it has detailed the steps being taken to address the various causes of air pollution.Advocate Sanjeev Ralli, appearing for DPCC, made the submission before a bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva during the hearing of a PIL initiated by the court on the issue of rising air pollution in the city.On the dust generated by huge construction sites, DPCC said it had issued notices to around 172 projects of which around 40 were found violating dust control norms and fined Rs 50,000 as per directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).It said over Rs 22 lakh was collected for such violations.The bench, however, was not satisfied and said under the Air Act, the committee had the power to initiate prosecution and shut down the sites that continue to violate norms.It also said the Rs 50,000 fine was not a deterrent as after paying the amount a person would keep on violating. DPCC agreed with this view and said it will take steps to shut down projects which repeatedly violate the norms.DPCC said it would be strict and initiate prosecution against violators.On burning of leaves, garbage, plastic and rubble, DPCC said a fine of Rs 5000 is levied upon those found violating and added that it was also keeping a close watch on MCD dump sites to prevent burning of waste.Referring to thermal power plants in Delhi, DPCC said a plant run by the city government at Rajghat has been shut down till March 15 and the committee has also ordered closure of four of the five units of the NTPC plant at Badarpur.
