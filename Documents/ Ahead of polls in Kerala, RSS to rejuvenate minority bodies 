The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Kerala leadership is learnt to have plans for stepping up the activities of the Rashtriya Isai Manch and the Muslim Rashtriya Manch to reach out to the Christian and Muslim communities before the Assembly elections.Sources say the Sangh leadership, which will spearhead the BJP campaign, is trying to rope in leaders, including historians, legal luminaries, academicians and bureaucrats, from both communities to head the movement. The leadership is understood to have identified some of them and has held discussions in some cases.The idea is to project the manch as a socio-cultural forum of the Sangh to efface the popular notion that the State BJP unit is being headed by hardcore Hindutva proponents, sources say.Though the change of guard in the BJP State leadership was expected to give a fillip to the partyâ€™s plans to win over the Nair Service Society and different denominations of the Christian community, a dominant section in the party still holds that it did not yield the desired results.
