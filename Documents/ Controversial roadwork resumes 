Work on the controversial road, adjacent to the ancient to Kamalapur tank of the Vijayanagar period, has resumed. Road-laying activities have been going on briskly with earthmovers being pressed into service and gravel being laid to strengthen the base. Work has resumed despite objections from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which apprehends that the ancient water system would be threatened.In March last, the Public Works Department had taken up work to lay a two-kilometre stretch of road adjacent to the tank bund where two sluices, which are above the ground level, are located. The 15th century tank irrigates around 1,500 acres of land throughout the year.Work was stopped after objections from te ASI on the ground that the laying of the road would distort the original character of the ancient tank, which fell within the core zone of the Hampi World Heritage Site. The ASI has written to the Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority in Hosapete, with Deputy Commissioner of Ballari as its chairman and also Principal Secretary, Kannada and Culture, seeking their intervention in the matter.Meanwhile, in June last, the apprehension of the ASI came true when a crater developed near one of the sluices. However, the reason for the shrinking of a portion of the road was not known; it was suspected that the movement of heavy vehicles, transporting mud, might be the reason as the area was receiving continuous rainfall then.Sources in the ASI, while expressing shock, told The Hindu that they would take up the issue with the authority concerned to get the work stopped.
