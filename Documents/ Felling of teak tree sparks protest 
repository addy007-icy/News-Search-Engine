The felling of a 20-year-old teak tree on the premises of the Kerala Water Authority headquarters at Vellayambalam to construct a building to house its Central Control Unit triggered strong protest from the public on Sunday evening.As workers employed by the KWA contractor were uprooting the teak tree using JCB, a few people who had gathered on the Manaveeyam Veedhi to watch an evening programme, resisted the move. “When we questioned the workers, they left the place in a hurry,” said Prakash, managing trustee of Indus Cycling Embassy and a member of Tree Walk.The activists took up the issue with Forest Department officials, whose permission is required for felling trees. Deputy Ranger, Social Forestry Wing, K. Udayan Nair said the department had not accorded permission to cut the tree.The KWA had sought permission to cut 12 trees to enable construction of the new building and it was given after scrutiny by the Tree Committee.“For this particular tree, the KWA has not sought permission. If the public had not alerted us, at least two more teak trees could have been axed. Action will be initiated against the contractor for violating the Tree Protection Act 2005,” he said.The new 10-storey building, in addition to the control room, will house the office of the Managing Director and the administration block. “It is the first green building in the city. It has been designed in a way to avoid damage to trees. The KWA management should conduct an inquiry on who had directed the felling of the tree,” said a KWA union leader.
