He must have been knocked down by a vehicle first and then decapitated. But what could be the motive and who had cut painter Kiran Kumar’s head off are the questions the Manchal police of Cyberabad are not able to find answers.Investigators almost hit a cul-de-sac having pursued all the clues in the sensational murder reported on December 6 last. A resident of Medipally in Yacharam mandal of Ranga Reddy district, the 22-year-old victim went to Manchal on the evening of December 6, 2015 to attend a marriage.Along with two others friends, he started on his two-wheeler for Medipally around 6 p.m. The trio stopped at Japal en route and consumed liquor on roadside. They started again after some time. This time, Kiran zoomed past his friends. They stopped at Gungal and rang him on his mobile phone but couldn’t reach him.Confused, they made some more calls and started for Manchal route only to be shocked to see Kiran’s body without head on Rangapur-Gungal road. “The killers apparently severed his head after ramming his bike with a heavy vehicle,” say the police.The next morning, they found the severed head with almost entire skin peeled off nearly 50 yards away. As mobile phone Call Data Record (CDR) gave crucial leads in many cases, investigators started off analysing Kiran’s as well, hoping to achieve a breakthrough.They went on grilling several suspects based on the CDR, but couldn’t stumble upon any fresh clues. Suspecting that strong motive like sexual jealousy could have been the motive behind the homicide, they inquired with locals. No information was forthcoming.All persons, at whom the victim’s father pointed the accusing finger, were grilled at length. No evidence was found to connect any of them with Kiran’s killing.
