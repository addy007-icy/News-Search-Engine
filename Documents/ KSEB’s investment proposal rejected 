The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) has rejected a proposal of the Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEB) to replace two faulty diesel engine generators at the Brahmapuram diesel power plant with gas turbines as it was deemed an imprudent investment.Chairman T.M. Manoharan and members K. Vikraman Nair and S. Venugopal said the KSEB had not considered the cost as well as other aspects while seeking approval. The commission is duty-bound to regulate the power purchase process of the board at the most cost-effective manner to safeguard consumersâ€™ interests. If the commission approves any imprudent expenditure of the board, it will have to be passed on to the consumers. The commission made a detailed appraisal of the additional power requirement of the State during the next five years. It reviewed whether the cost of the power generated from the Brahmapuram project would be competitive when compared with the price from other sources and also whether it would be wise to invest in a gas-based plant, especially in the wake of the gas shortage.The commission ruled that it could not approve the prohibitively high investment proposed on a gas-based plant till a fuel supply agreement at affordable rate is put in place.Proposal to replace diesel generators at Brahmapuram diesel plant with gas turbines
