On an alert by the locals, the Chottanikkara police rushed to the spot and carried out the rescue operations. “The truck took a deviation to the Chottanikkara Bypass from Irumpanam while the driver of the bus, coming from the opposite direction, lost control over the vehicle and hit the driver’s cabin of the truck ’’, officials said.
