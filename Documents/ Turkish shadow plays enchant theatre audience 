The shadow plays, Magic Tree and Garbage Monster, provided great joy to the audience, particularly children, at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) here. Coming in between plays that dealt with profound subjects, the play of shadows throws up the possibility of giving a light touch even though the theme is grave.The shadow plays by Cengiz Ozek Theatre, Turkey, use the traditional Turkish shadow theatre form Karagoz. The director and puppeteer Cengiz Ozek tried to bring a modern interpretation of the shamanic characteristic of the traditional shadow theatre form to the theatre festival.Karagoz as an art form is considered to have originated in the early 17th Century in Ottoman Turkey. Karagoz, the main character, and his best friend, Hacivat, are present in every play. The slapstick humour of Magic Tree makes it enjoyable even for a non-Turkish speaker.The manner in which the plays bring an entire fantasy world to life makes it difficult to believe that there is just one person behind the screen, who manipulates so many figures.Lessons in conservationGarbage Monster brings up important lessons in our role in preserving and caring for our environment and the planet.Having learnt about the fabrication of Karagoz figures from his teacher in school, Cengiz Ozek scanned several museums and private collections to enrich his knowledge about the subject. Today his own Karagoz figures and collections are exhibited in many museums.Thalamus , a German dance drama choreographed by Urs Dietrich, researches the secretes inherent in the changes and dissolution of the real life. It was a powerful solo performance of a dancer who consciously implements fissures and contradictions and thus infuses his work with a certain degree of irony.A male ant has straight antennae by Mandeep Raikhy and Company, New Delhi, and Colour of Trans 2.0 by Panmai Theatre, Chennai, represented the National Theatre in the festival.Playing out polarities of masculinity, ~A male ant has straight antennae challenges singular perspectives on the male body and its moorings. Presenting the struggles of trans people, Colour of Trans 2.0 forces the audience through laughter and clown forms to hold a mirror to themselves and examine their own deep-rooted prejudices against the trans people.
