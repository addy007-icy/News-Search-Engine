Amid Gujarat government’s apparently desperate attempts to reach a compromise with agitating Patidar community over contentious quota issue, the agitation leader Hardik Patel told the media in Surat while he was being presented in court that “once released from jail, he would take the agitation further and not even Chief Minister Anandiben Patel can stop it.”“The agitation will continue as per our plans and no one can stop it, not even my foiba [aunt],” he said referring to Ms. Patel.The 22-year-old is in jail in Surat facing sedition charge and was recently chargesheeted by the police. However, he continues to send messages asking the Patel community leaders to continue the stir till they got the reservation benefits for their children in universities and government jobs.Recently, as a part of conciliatory approach, the State government decided to scrap 74 “minor police cases” involving 380 persons of the Patel community, who were accused to be involved in violent agitation.Subsequently, a prominent Cabinet Minister Nitin Patel held a series of meetings with the Patidar community leaders representing religious trusts and institutes to resolve the issue.Compromise?According to insiders privy to the talks between the government and the community leaders, more than 250 other cases of serious nature would also be withdrawn by the State Home Department while those charged under draconian sedition law will be allowed to seek bail as the authorities would not oppose their bail proceedings in the court.The government's strategy to bury the hatchet with the Patels that can spoil the BJP’s prospects in the Assembly polls came as an admission that the Anandiben government has mishandled the stir with high handed police approach.“We told the minister that the way police dealt with the agitation was highly improper and we want the cases to be withdrawn against those who participated in the state wide agitation,” a community leader who attended meetings told The Hindu.Immediately after the agitation, local elections for municipal and panchayats were held in the State in which the BJP lost badly . The Patels’ drift away from the BJP was one of the factors that led to the party’s debacle in the panchayat polls.
