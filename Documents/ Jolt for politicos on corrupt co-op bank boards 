State politicians from various parties, who have been heading state cooperative banks that have in the past faced corruption charges, suffered a major setback with the State cabinet deciding to amend the cooperative law prohibiting them from contesting bank polls for the next 10 years.The State cabinet on Tuesday amended the Cooperatives Act, which would mean restriction on members of the board dissolved on charges of corruption from contesting polls in the future.Those in the dock include NCP’s Ajit Pawar, Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, Hasan Mushrif, Congress leader Madhukar Chavan, BJP leader Pandurang Phundkar, Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul and PWP leaders Jayant Patil and Meenakshi Patil, who all have been board members of State cooperative banks.After the cabinet meet, cooperatives minister Chadrakant Patil said: “It was imperative we ended wide-spread corruption in these banks. A decision was always in the offing.” The minister said cabinet decision effectively means that a sub section 3(a) will be added to the existing provision of section 73 (a)(c) of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act.The State government will issue an ordinance announcing the change. Senior officials said the cabinet decision was based on recommendations by the Reserve Bank of India and has nothing to do with allegations of political vendetta, as is being alleged by Opposition parties.Leader of the Opposition, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil claimed the BJP-Shiv Sena government was trying to scuttle the cooperative’s movement in the State, and was misusing its powers. “If it wants, this government could always take action on corruption, but this is not the way,” he said.Cooperative banks in the State have been in the red for a while now. Notwithstanding the best efforts by successive governments to pump funds into them, corrupt practices by board members meant many went bankrupt. It is widely believed the sector is dominated by leaders of the NCP and the Congress, and the BJP-Sena are trying hard to wield some influence.The government said it was high time it cracked down on corruption
