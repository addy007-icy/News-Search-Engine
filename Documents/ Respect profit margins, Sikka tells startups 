Bigger startups must have a greater respect for profit margins and the boom in the sector is a healthy sign for the economy, Infosys Chief Executive Officer Vishal Sikka said. Mr.Sikka’s statement on Thursday comes at a time when leading Indian startups have raised huge amounts of funds but most of them have not yet turned profitable.“Overall, the emphasis that is being placed in India on startups and on entrepreneur is a good thing. Of course it is true that vast majority of the startups fail. However, entrepreneurs never fail,” Mr. Sikka said. Infosys is also partnering the government in various initiatives such as Start Up India, Make in India and Digital India.“The startup movement in India is absolutely a very healthy sign. It is a very good sign. It is a very positive sign of a growing economy, of innovation, of an innovative youth culture and that's a very good thing,” said Mr.Sikka.Innovation by startups will lead to more products, applications and usage of technology in a smart way. In a move to help startup ecosystem in India, the government is holding a session on startups which will see participation from about 2,000 representatives of new startups, venture capita;ists and CEOs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to unveil a startup action plan during the event.“The government’s support to startups is encouraging as it would lead to incubation, mentoring and funding,” Mr.Sikka said.Recently, Infosys had created an Innovation Fund to invest in startups around the world.
