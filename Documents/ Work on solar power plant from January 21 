The work on the proposed solar power plant to be constructed by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) at Thalakkulathur under its Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) project will begin on January 21. Minister for Power Aryadan Mohammed will lay the foundation stone for the multi-crore project, which is claimed to be a first-of-its-kind solar power generation undertaking in North Kerala.A.K. Saseendran, MLA, who chaired a meeting of senior KSEB officials from the district at the PWD Rest House, here on Friday, said the plant, now constructed with a 650-kilowatt capacity, would be able to feed the increasing power requirements of the Malabar region with its gradual extension in the future. “The KSEB has got around 3.76 acres of land at the project area and the further extension of the project is easily possible with the timely allotment of fund by the government,” he said. “With just Rs.4.68 crore, the KSEB would be able to complete the first phase at its own land. The government has also sanctioned a separate training centre for KSEB officials at the same project site which will also be an advantage for the Malabar region,” he added.KSEB officials who attended the meeting said the area selected for the project had huge development potential and possibilities were high for the opening of an exclusive substation to support the initiative in the future.“The panels to be used for the setting up of the plant will ensure flawless functioning for at least 25 years and the investment will be worth to pool the increasing power requirements utilising the renewable energy sources,” they said.“The only concern with regard to the project is the unexpected weather changes, which can seriously reduce the power generation. Compared to other States, the cloudy sky in Kerala is a challenge, but we are optimistic to go ahead with the project at this place,” said a senior officer at the KSEB. He also said that the gradual extension of the project in different phases would definitely help the department to source the renewable energy sources to the maximum.KSEB officials said the project had already won administrative sanction from the KSEB Fulltime Directors’ Board and it would be implemented with the financial support of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).
