A fund set up by the Delhi government to boost green projects is now being used to bolster the ongoing odd-even experiment, with expenses of volunteers and monitoring teams being borne out of it.The Air Ambience Fund was set up in 2008, but the government has been able to use just about one-fourth of the Rs.230.78-crore collected so far. Collected through the Department of Trade and Taxes, the fund gets 25 paise from the sale of each litre of diesel here. Government officials said Rs.60 crore has been spent on giving subsidies to people buying electric vehicles so far.The government has now decided to start using the remaining Rs.170 crore to help the implement the odd-even policy and subsidise battery-operated rickshaws.A senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee official said Rs.3.5 crore will go towards the cost of deploying the thousand of Civil Defence volunteers and hiring about 100 taxis for teams monitoring the initiative. Meanwhile, the Environment Department is working on funding clean energy projects like the New Delhi Municipal Councilâ€™s electric bus fleet.
