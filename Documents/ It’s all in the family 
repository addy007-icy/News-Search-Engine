Mohd. Ghouse is back. And in this round of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections, he is not alone, for joining the fray are his wife and son.The three-time corporator parted ways with AIMIM following differences with the leadership after Bihar elections. The stated reason, according to the corporator Mohd. Ghouse, is bursting crackers!“The party leadership questioned me after I burst crackers when the BJP lost the Bihar Assembly elections last year. I doubted their sincerity and broke away from the party,” Mohammed Ghouse told The Hindu . However, Majlis sources said Ghouse developed a grouse because he and his family were denied tickets.Along with his wife Parveen Sultana and son Mohd. Sohail who are making their political debut in this election, he joined the Congress party. Mohd. Ghouse is contesting from Puranapul, his wife from Shahalibanda and son from Ghansi Bazaar wards. “People say no one dare contest against MIM. But our family will be contesting from three seats while other candidates of my party are fighting from nine seats in old city,” he says.While Parveen is a housewife, their 25 year-old son Sohail runs a pearl and jewellery shop at Charminar. “Politics is not new for our family, our relatives are corporators in municipalities in Maharashtra and Karnataka,” says Mr. Ghouse. The Ghouse family has been spending 16 hours a day campaigning in the old city while his wife winds it up at 6 p.m. “We are working hard. Let’s see whether the voters wake up from the slumber and support the right candidate,” he says before signing off.
