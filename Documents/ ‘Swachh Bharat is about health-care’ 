‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is not just about cleanliness. It is also about health care. Keeping our surroundings clean and stopping open defecation are the simplest measures of avoiding spread of communicable diseases,” Goutham Arali, district Swachh Bharat Mission coordinator, has said.He was speaking after inaugurating a water purification unit in the government school premises in Karanji- Bujurg village in Aurad taluk.“Most communicable diseases are water borne. If we drink clean water and keep ourselves clean, we can avoid a lot of diseases,” he said. He felicitated Yogesh Kamshetty and Swati Kamshetty, Bidar- based couple, who donated money for the water purification plant. Dr. Kamshetty, who teaches at the Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences, said this was his way of giving back to the society.
