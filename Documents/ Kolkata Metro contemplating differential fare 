Kolkata Metro is examining the feasibility of implementing differential fare during peak and off-peak hours to improve its finances.“We are currently debating on differential pricing strategy,” Kolkata Metro Rail general manager A. K. Kapoor said here on Tuesday.Differential pricing means commuters travelling during peak hours will have to pay more than those availing the service in the non-peak hours.Mr. Kapoor said the differential fare would, however, not be implemented right now.He said operational loss is almost two-third of the revenue though Metro Railway has rationalised movement of the rakes in the full-route to reduce costs. - PTI
