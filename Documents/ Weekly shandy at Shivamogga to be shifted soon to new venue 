The weekly shandy, which was earlier being held every Tuesday at a site around the Milaghatta Road, adjacent to a private bus-stand here, will be shifted to the open ground in front of the bus depot of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC).At present, the weekly shandy is being held on the roadside. As the bus terminals of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and private operators are very close to the venue of the shandy, the traffic density on Milaghatta Road is high there. Traffic snarls and jams had become common there during the weekly shandy. Movement of heavy vehicles along the stretch was causing inconvenience to traders and buyers alike.The Shivamogga City Corporation had recently decided to shift the weekly shandy to the open ground under its custody in front of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation bus-depot and had reserved a 200m x 80m space there for the purpose. As it had been planned to widen the Milaghatta Road, the shifting of weekly shandy had become inevitable for the authorities.K.B. Prasanna Kumar, Shivamogga MLA, visited the weekly shandy on Tuesday and held discussions with traders and general public there on the issue. Mr. Kumar told presspersons that the city corporation would create basic amenities at the new venue, including electricity and drinking water. The flooring would be done there with granite. The work was likely to be completed in about 15 days and later the weekly shandy would be shifted to the new venue, he said.Mayor Mangala Annappa was present.All basic amenities, including supply of power and drinking water, will be created at the new site in about 15 days.K.B.
