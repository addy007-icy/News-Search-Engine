“The laws here are not stringent enough to block soundtracks which are copied and not credited,” music director A.R. Rahman said on Wednesday.Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the launch of a neo-Carnatic single by violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan, he said when it is released, people should follow the guidelines, but should they use it and put someone else’s name, it becomes a problem. “That’s why there is a fear in putting things out first,” he said.When asked if releasing singles online would challenge the success of albums, the Oscar and Grammy-winning composer said that both of them will continue to co-exist. “The whole process about physical product and printing gets avoided. For instance, the song thalli pokathey was conceived in a week but mixed and uploaded on the digital platform the same day. The power of putting it out is simple and tremendous, but you should do it when you believe it is the right time,” he said.Violinist Ganesh said that his single, released in collaboration with singer Bombay Jayashree and pianist Stephen Devassy, wanted to present a different visualisation. “This is an age of visuals. When we think of carnatic, we relate it only to some images of temples or a community. I wanted to change the cliche.” He said he had brought the single in raga Begada and tried to portray it in a modern way. “Even people who may not usually like Carnatic music may appreciate this one,” he added.
