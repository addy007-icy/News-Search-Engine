Have you met Shop Skipper yet? It’s like the Zomato of the fashion world. You know where you can get the juiciest burgers in town, but do you know where you’d find metallic silver loafers? This new interactive app can tell you just that.Started by Kamakshi Maheshwari and Prerna Jain, it works differently from other e-commerce apps. “It helps you find stores in your city, and details what clothes and accessories they sell,” says Kamakshi, who came up with the idea when she was studying at the London Business School. “Shop Skipper eliminates the search time associated with offline shopping,” she adds.It does not deliver products to your doorstep, but tells you where to head to for that specific LBD or even those sophisticated cocktail rings.Launched during the first week of this month, the app has now planned its first event — a treasure hunt that will take place this Sunday. “It’s a two-hour event, and 200 people have already registered. There are prizes worth Rs. 10,000 to be won,” Kamakshi says. It is open to anybody above 14, and some 50-year-olds have also signed up.Each team should have four to six members, and they need to download the app on their phones to take part.Participants will be given clues in the form of riddles. This will lead them to stores listed on the app. On reaching the store, they will have to perform an activity, and get the next clue. In order to avoid cluttering, the participants will be split into five sets, and they will take five different routes.Sounds intriguing? For registrations, log on to the ShopSkipper page on Facebook. Spot registrations can also be done at the venue — CSI Wesley Grounds, Royapettah. The event starts at 10 a.m.
