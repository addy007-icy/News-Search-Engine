With work on reconstruction of Nelson Mandela Road gaining momentum, the authorities closed a stretch of the road from Millennium circle to KSRTC depot on Wednesday, affecting movement of traffic.Several motorists had a tough time negotiating their way through the adjoining narrow bylanes of Bannimantap to reach the venue. “We will complete the work on the stretch in the first phase. It will take us about 10 days to lay the concrete top and another 28 days for curing. Next, we will take up the remaining stretch of the road till Highway circle,” PWD Executive Engineer Raju told The Hindu .Nelson Mandela Road, a crucial arterial road of the city, is expected to be virtually out of bounds for the traffic for the next three months.The closure of the road saw a sudden increase in vehicular density on the narrow bylanes of Bannimantap. The motorists had to use the road leading into Bannimantap from LIC building as the alternative route, but the unasphalted track kicked up a huge plume of dust. Mujahid, a resident of Bannimantap, came down heavily on the authorities for not making alternative arrangements for traffic movement.However, KSRTC authorities worked out an arrangement to ensure that the path of KSRTC buses entering and leaving the depots on the road was not blocked.“We held a meeting with PWD officials, who agreed to take up work in two phases so that at least one gate of the depot is open. So, all the 400 buses of the KSRTC depots will be entering and leaving only through one gate,” said KSRTC Divisional Controller (Rural) M. Mahesh.
