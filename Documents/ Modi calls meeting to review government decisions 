Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called a meeting of his Council of Ministers for January 27, a day after Republic Day to seek a review of all decisions taken by the Cabinet, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in the last one-and-a-half years of the NDA government.“The agenda circulated has only one item, and it seems to be a mid-term review of sorts for the government,” said a top source. At the end of 2016, the government will be half-way through its five-year term, and this year is being seen as a make-or-break one to deliver on governance and the economy.Mr. Modi had earlier set up eight groups of secretaries to suggest innovative ideas to implement the government’s programmes, and this too is being seen as a way to keep his team on its toes. The agenda has set off speculation that there could be a Cabinet reshuffle during the winter session of the budget session of Parliament.“Politically already it was being said States like Bihar were over-represented in the Council of Ministers, and now that elections are due in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, one can expect to see some additions from that State,” said a senior office-bearer of the BJP.Sources had earlier confirmed to The Hindu that Mr. Modi would reach out to the Opposition after Republic Day to clear certain Bills, barring the Goods and Services Tax Bill, in the budget session.
