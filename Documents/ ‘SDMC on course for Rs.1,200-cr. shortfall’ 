By the end of this financial year, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation will have an income shortfall of Rs.1,200 crore, Leader of Opposition Farhad Suri said on Tuesday while presenting his budget speech to the Standing Committee. Mr. Suri said that Commissioner Puneet Kumar Goel's estimate of a Rs.600 crore decrease in targeted revenue had not included many other factors.“The actual shortfall will be at least Rs.1,200 crore as the Commissioner included money from the municipal reform fund in his income estimate even though the Delhi Government has not given this in years,” said Mr. Suri, adding that revenue from toll tax and property tax is likely to be lower than the target.“The inefficiency of the Corporation is evident as it has been unable to boost its internal sources of revenue,” said Mr. Suri.The SDMC has fallen short of internal revenue targets over the years, with the shortfall going up from 12.26 per cent in 2012-2013 to 74.85 per cent in 2014-2015.Mr. Suri also highlighted the fact that expenditure over the years had fallen 25 per cent off the target on an average.“In the budget for 2013-2014, the Commissioner has said that there was notional surplus of Rs.650 crore. Where has this money gone? If there was a surplus, how come it is not reflected in the next financial year's balance, which is zero,” he asked. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, Varyam Kaur, also gave her budget speech to the EDMC Standing Committee on Tuesday.Rejecting all the hike in property tax rates proposed by the Commissioner, Ms. Kaur said that the EDMC had failed to fulfil its basic responsibilities as employees had not been paid in months. For the first time, some of the EDMC staff attending the meeting wore black bands on their foreheads in protest against the delayed salaries.
