Andhra Pradesh Sarpanches’ Association founder president Y. Babu Rajendra Prasad on Wednesday pressed for a scheme ‘Vidya Bharat’ on the lines of Swatchh Bharat to improve the quality of education in schools run by local bodies.The quality of education in the schools run by local bodies was not up to the mark, he said while briefing newsmen on the resolutions adopted at its State-level meeting here.“Vidya Bharat should get precedence over Swatchh Bharat,” he said, adding the future of 60 lakh students pursuing education in these educational institutions in the State remained bleak now.The meeting chaired by its newly-elected president Pamidi Venkat Rao demanded 50 per cent share in the sand seigniorage fee for the cash-strapped Panchayat Raj institutions and strengthening of the local bodies with devolution of funds and decentralisation of powers as mandated by the Constitution. It pressed for release of MGNREGS funds for maintaining cement roads in villages and improving sanitation.
