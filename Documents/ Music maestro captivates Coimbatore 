 The first few lines of Rahman's latest, ‘Thalli Pogathey’, is being rehearsed during sound check and a loud cheer erupts from the crowd, which has been waiting for over three hours. A.R. Rahman’s ‘Nenje Ezhu’ is in town and people have travelled from Bombay, Palakkad etc to catch the concert of their beloved maestro.From the cute kindergarten student, Afreen, who ran to Blaaze to take a selfie, to ‘Rahmaniacs’, a group of youngsters who arrived from Palakkad who live and breathe Rahman’s music, to hordes of girls on the terrace of adjacent buildings screaming and screeching and even actors Dhanush and Trisha, who are seated in the crowd, the audience is filled with people across age groups, languages and different walks of life to groove to the concert which has an astounding line up of exceptional singers right from music veteran SPB to young blood such as Sid Sriram.The stage is set, the lights are aglow and the audience are seated, but only until Rahman comes on stage.As Azhagiya Tamil Magan’s title song announces the Music Maestro’s entry and he starts singing ‘Rathi thee thee’ from the movie ‘Sivaji’ and follows it up by the evergreen friendship anthem ‘Mustafa Mustafa’, he instantly captivates all the hearts of Coimbatore and they rise from the seats and groove to the music.The frenzy continued for nearly three hours.
