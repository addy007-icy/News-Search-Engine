A day before the Italian Marines case comes up for hearing in the Supreme Court, the president of the defence committee of the Italian Senate declared on Tuesday that the marine Massimiliano Latorre who went back home in 2014 because of ill-health will not return to face the judicial process for the 2012 murder of two fishermen off the Kerala coast.“Massimiliano Latorre will not go back to India, and work is being done on the possibility of requesting for Salvatorre Girone to be able to return to Italy,” Senator Nicola Latorre of the defence committee was quoted as saying in a report by Italian agency ANSA on Tuesday.The permission for Mr. Latorre to stay away from India will expire on January 15, after which he was expected to return.However, the comments of Senatore Latorre (not a relative of the marine), has added a new dimension to the case.
