Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan and his wife Vimala ushered in the New Year by spending about two hours receiving greetings and wishing people from different strata of society. The majestic confines of the Raj Bhavan were thrown open to public. Prominent among those who called on the Governor between 11 a.m. and noon were Union Minister of Labour Bandaru Dattatreya, Telangana Deputy Chief Minister Kadiam Srihari, and Tourism Minister Chandulal, and A. Chakrapani, Chairman of the AP Legislative Council..For the hordes of children of all ages from a half-a-dozen schools, it was an occasion when they soaked in the imposing confines of the Raj Bhavan. What was most interesting for the children were the long tables on either side in the Durbar Hall that were loaded with sweets and savouries , apart from the usual selection of coffee and tea.
