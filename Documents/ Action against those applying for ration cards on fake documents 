Ganjam district collector in Odisha on Friday ordered concerned Block Development Officers (BDO) to lodge FIR at local police stations against six persons, who had made false declarations to get ration cards under National Food Security Act (NFSA).This strict action has come up in Odisha CMâ€™s home district Ganjam, while reports of well-to-do persons including elected public representatives being included in the list of beneficiaries of NFSA are coming up from different parts of the State. The persons against whom district administration has decided to take legal action were from Buguda, Beguiagada and Shergarh blocks. All these six persons were found to have deceived the administration through false declarations and documents to procure ration cards. According to the collector, Prem Chandra Chaudhury, this strict action would surely make many others realise their similar mistake. Administration has requested persons not eligible for ration cards under NFSA to get their names stuck off from ration card beneficiary list as early possible to escape legal action.Ganjam district administration directed BDO of Buguda to file FIR against Manini Subudhi, who happens to be an Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM) posted in government hospital at Bhanjanagar. The BDO of Shergarh would file FIR with police against a lecturer of Pittal college, P.Tanuja Kumari Das and P.Sunita Patra, a clerk of Pittal junior college. Three persons, who had used false declaration to get ration cards have been targeted for legal action in Beguniapada block. They are Urmila Mishra, whose son is a High School teacher, Rama Panda, owner of a paddy cleaner and tractor, Intishree Das, who has two autorickshaws and another four-wheeler in her name. These three of Beguniapada block were from Digapada village.Till now around 17 government employees have been suspended in Ganjam district on charges of procuring ration cards by providing wrong information about their economic status.
