The Tenth Pay Commission’s recommendation for a law to regulate transfers and postings of government servants is likely to put the State’s political leadership in a fix. If the recommendation is accepted, it will take away a major weapon used by the political masters to get their way with the bureaucracy, particularly the middle level.The commission has suggested a legislation along with statutory rules on the lines of the Maharashtra Government Servants Regulation of Transfers and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Official Duties Act, 2005. The Act and the rules should be strictly enforceable, fixing tenures for postings allowing shifts only on substantial grounds.RecommendationThe recommendation had been listed in Part 2 of the report submitted to the government the other day. The recommendation for the establishment of a Kerala Administrative Service might be welcomed by the service organisations though they might have quite a few reservations in the finer details while implementing it.The panel has suggested setting up a Service Selection Board to select officers of quality and integrity, replacing the existing system of recognising quality in promotion through special rules and executive orders. In the case of Selection of Special Secretaries, Service Selection Board may consider the details of all officers in the feeder category and prepare a short list of 10 persons for every vacancy and then interview may be conducted based on which the final selection may be made. This interview may be video-graphed and preserved for future use in case of dispute or appeal.Wherever, Service Selection Board procedure is in operation. The board will have to obtain and consider report from the Intelligence Department about the officer for the last three years, the panel recommended.The Panel has apparently given special attention to the Secretariat service, by suggesting several steps to improve efficiency and structure the movement of files.
