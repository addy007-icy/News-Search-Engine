A couple of topics at the recently-concluded 103rd Indian Science Congress, which was hosted by University of Mysore on its campus, raised eyebrows.The mega science summit was not entirely controversy-free as it scheduled presentation of a paper titled ‘Blowing of Shankh – an indigenous tradition for fitness and wellness’ and a special lecture under environmental science on ‘Lord Shiva as a greatest environmentalist in the world’. Many wondered how these topics made into the Science Congress.When asked, Vice-Chancellor K.S. Rangappa told reporters here on Monday that he too was not aware of these topics. “I learnt about the topics only through the media. I even spoke to the ISC officials on how the topics got listed in the sessions. Even they had no answers,” he replied.
