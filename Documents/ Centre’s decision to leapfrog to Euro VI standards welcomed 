The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has welcomed the landmark decision of the Union government to skip Euro V emissions standards and leapfrog to Euro VI standards in 2020.“With this, India will take the first step towards fuel-neutral standards that will lower the gap between emissions standards for diesel and petrol vehicles,” the organisation observed.Said CSE director general Sunita Narain: “This is a game-changer decision and will help India leapfrog to much cleaner emissions. This is needed at a time when India is motorising very rapidly.The number of vehicles that India will add in the next decade is over twice the current vehicle stock in the country. Stringent emissions standards are needed to reduce the pollution impact of this immense motorisation.” The current emissions standards of Bharat Stage IV in a few cities and Bharat Stage III in the rest of the country are 10 to 15 years behind the norms followed by Europe.CSE researchers point out that this step is urgently required to address the concern over emissions from the current diesel technology. As India leaps from Bharat Stage IV to Euro VI, particulate emissions from diesel cars will be reduced by 68 per cent; NOx emissions can come down by 82 per cent. Reduction from heavy duty vehicles will be 87 per cent and 67 per cent, respectively, for particulates and NOx.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy in CSE and head of its sustainable urbanisation teams, points out: “These outdated emissions standards allow diesel vehicles to emit several times more nitrogen oxides and particulate matter compared to petrol vehicles.The government’s latest move will reduce the time lag with Europe to just six years in 2020.” After implementing Bharat Stage IV emissions standards and Bharat Stage III in 2010, India had virtually remained without any further roadmaps for improvement in emissions from vehicles. This also means that until 2020 -- other than expanding the current Bharat Stage IV emissions standards -- India would not have moved forward. All this while, motorisation would continue to explode based on 10-15 year old emissions control measures.Current emissions standards followed are 10 to 15 years behind the norms followed by Europe
