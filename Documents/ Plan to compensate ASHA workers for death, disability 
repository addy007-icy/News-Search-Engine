In an attempt to sustain motivation and performance of ASHA workers at field level, the Odisha government has announced monetary incentives in the event of their death and permanent disability during duty.“ASHAs are functioning at the community level in order to facilitate community level care and support for health and well being of the people. They are provided with monetary incentives for the activities which are performed by them at the community level. Further non-monetary incentives are provided to them in order to sustain their motivation and perform better at the field level,” the government guideline states.According to the National Health Mission, Odisha, ASHA workers will get compensation of Rs.1 lakh for death while at work. They will get the compensation if only death occurs while performing duty as ASHA.“The payment will be made to the nearest kin of the deceased ASHA like husband, son or any other survivor. The person concerned has to apply to the Block Medical Officer concerned within seven days of death of ASHA enclosing all relevant documents and certificates,” the guideline says.Similarly, ASHA will only get compensation for permanent disability while performing the duty as ASHA.
