The move to bring 31 grama panchayats and one municipality under the provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, better known as PESA, has rekindled the hope among tribal communities for a better life with traditional rights over their land, livelihood and resources.On a recommendation by the Department of Scheduled Tribes, the Union Cabinet would in all likely approve the proposal in two weeks. All tribal majority areas of Wayanad, Palakkad, Kannur, Malappuram and Idukki will be brought under the provisions of the law, protected by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.Talking to The Hindu , Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha leader M. Geethanandan said the move would definitely benefit over 4.2 lakh tribes people in the State who had been subjected to worst forms of exploitation. ‘‘The Act is one of the major demands of the ‘‘nilppu samaram’’ by the sabha in front of the Secretariat last year.‘‘Only Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal had delayed implementation of the Act so far. It is delayed justice, as even progressive forces have showed no enthusiasm in implementing it,” Mr. Geethanandan said. Once the Cabinet ratifies the proposal, it will come into force in these areas replacing the Panchayati Raj Act.‘‘It is indeed a welcome initiative as States such as Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have improved the living standards of tribes considerably by implementing the Act,” said K.A. Ramu, a tribal activist at Attappady.According to experts, the Constitution protects tribal rights under the Fifth and Sixth Schedules. Most tribes in the country are collectively identified under Article 342 (1&2) of the Constitution as Scheduled Tribes, which provides them overarching immunity to the extent of granting them the right to self-determination as guaranteed under Article 244 (Administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas) of Part X: The Scheduled and Tribal Areas.
