It is almost a year since the work on a road over bridge replacing an existing railway level crossing on Cochrane Basin Bridge Road in Korukkupet was completed, but the flyover is still waiting to be inaugurated.The reason for the delay: a small patch of bitumen is yet to be laid and street lights and reflectors have to be installed. Contractors say they are waiting for payment from the civic body to take up these minor works.At present, hundreds of motorists are forced to take a detour of at least five km to reach the centre of the city via Broadway.“Most of the streets in north Chennai are narrow. Due to the closure of the railway crossing, we have to leave at least half an hour early,” said S. Ranjith, a motorist from Perambur.The 500-metre-long flyover, which connects Vysarpadi Jeeva and Korukkupet, is two-lane and built across the rail line, that is primarily a freight movement corridor connecting Gudur and Ennore to Chennai. The ROB would free up road traffic on this densely-populated stretch that is lined with huts.The project was originally sanctioned in 2007 and is jointly undertaken by the Southern Railway and the State Highways Department. Work did not take off for almost two years, due to delay in the firming up of a “General Agreement Drawing” (GAD).Other reasons for the delay include uncertainty over the routes along which road traffic had to be diverted to facilitate the work and several stormwater drain works undertaken in the area by the Chennai Corporation.In 2009, work commenced after road traffic along the level crossing was closed, except for pedestrians and two-wheelers.“Steps would be taken to complete the remaining works before the notification of the Assembly elections,” said a Corporation official.
