Making a slew of promises to the farming community of the State, Pattali Makkal Katchi chief ministerial candidate Anbumani Ramadoss on Thursday entered into a “contract” with some of the farmers’ organisations assuring them that he would keep the promises made to them within two years if voted to power.While many of the promises were part of the draft manifesto already released by the party, additions have been made based on the suggestions of the farmers organisations.“All these would be incorporated in the final manifesto of the party. If we fail to implement the promises within two years, I will step down from Chief Ministership,” he told The Hindu after an interaction with representatives of various farmers’ organisations here.Prominent among his assurances were a separate budget for the agriculture sector, remunerative prices with 50 per cent profit to farmers for their produce, constitution of a farmers’ income committee, creation of four agro-economic zones, establishment of three more agricultural universities, including one at Thanjavur, promotion of agro-technology zones for various area-specific crops across the State, construction of check dams across rivers, priority for modernisation of agriculture and organic farming and one-time waiver of crop loans of cooperative societies.
