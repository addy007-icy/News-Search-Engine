The editorial rightly observes that “Islamabad needs a broader, more comprehensive strategy to deal with the issue at the grassroots level” (“Grim reminder in Charsadda,” Jan. 22). In spite of several terrorist attacks on its soil that have resulted in the loss of hundreds of innocent lives, Pakistan still deals with terrorists leniently. Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the Mumbai carnage, still roams free and continues to spew venom against India.Pakistan failed to take serious note of Hillary Clinton’s warning that it cannot keep snakes in its backyard and expect them to only bite its neighbour. It is time for it to take note of these warnings to prevent the loss of all these lives.Sanjit Ghatak,KolkataThe Pakistan military and the ISI’s flawed policies have allowed the Taliban and splinter groups to grow in the troubled Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. It is unfortunate that even after the Peshawar tragedy, no strategy has been adopted to curb the menace of terrorism. The latest deadly attack in Bacha Khan University only reinforces the fact that Pakistan’s dual policy on terrorism is causing bloodshed, not reducing it.K.R.Srinivasan,SecunderabadIt is a shame that the Pakistani Taliban have insulted the memory of Bacha Khan or Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan with the brutal assault on Bacha Khan University, an institution that was named after him. Bacha Khan, who had led a successful non-violent movement against the British, had earned the nickname Frontier Gandhi. The attack is a confirmation of Pakistan’s claim that it is as much a victim of terrorism as India. It would appear that modern Pakistan is caught between the two Talibans — one based in Afghanistan and the other, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which is home-grown. As a sovereign state, it is entirely up to Pakistan to draw the right lesson from the tragedy in the university.J. Akshobhya,Mysuru
