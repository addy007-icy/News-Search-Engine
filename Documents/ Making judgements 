A panel of investigative journalists held a spirited discussion on “Trial By Media” on the penultimate day of the Jaipur Literature Festival. Journalists and authors Avirook Sen, Madhu Trehan, and Shoma Chaudhury spoke in the session moderated by Rohit Gandhi.The twin murders of Arushi Talwar and Hemraj and the incarceration of Binayak Sen were the central points of the debate.Avirook, whose book, Aarushi casts aspersions on the dominant narrative of the parents committing the murders says, “I feel that the job of the media was to question the dominant narrative, instead of lapping up police reports, without questioning the basic issues that were evident in the case.The media trial makes media the judge, ignoring the fact that there is a three-tier legal system in the country and a lower court verdict can be overturned by a higher court. I think it is the Ekta Kapoor influence on our TV channels.”Shoma Chaudhary agreed with his premise and pointed out, “The Talwars are in jail because of the Indian media. There is an important distinction between trial by media based on facts, and one made on mere speculation. A similar issue occurred in the case of Binayak Sen, when the media reported the police version of the case, without a murmur.It has ensured that one of the bravest warriors of democracy in the country has been silenced.”Madhu Trehan added her observations: “I think even the judges are not removed from society and are often influenced by newspapers and TV news.The coverage is also selective. State abuses in the North East by armed forces hardly get any coverage, while we have in many cases, families of people arrested being interrogated on National TV. It is not a healthy development.”The phenomenon of paid news, the sidelining of ethics by some media houses, were also part of the discussion.The author is at JLF at the invitation of Teamwork Arts.
