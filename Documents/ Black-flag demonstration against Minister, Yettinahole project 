In their continuing opposition against the Yettinahole diversion project, green activists staged a black-flag demonstration against B. Ramanath Rai, Minister for Forests, Environment and Ecology, outside Nehru Maidan during Republic Day celebrations on Tuesday.The grouse of activists of the Sahyadri Samrakshana Sanchaya, who staged the protest, was that the Minister was supporting the project against the interests of people of Dakshina Kannada.Police arrested four activists led by Sanchayaâ€™s convener Dinesh Holla at about 9 a.m. Another group of six activists, led by Shashidhar Shetty, staged a protest near the gate of the maidan.The Police took all the protesters away from the venue and then shifted to the nearest Mangaluru South police station in a van. All activists were released without booking any case. When the activists returned to the nearby police lane to pick up their vehicles, they had heated exchange of words with a police officer. The officer reportedly questioned activists for parking their vehicles near his house in the lane and blocking the way.
