CPI (M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the United Democratic Front (UDF) government of watering down the recommendations of the 10th Pay Commission for government employees, teachers and pensioners in the State.Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, Mr. Vijayan alleged that for the first time a State government which appointed a commission to revise the wages of employees had cut the salaries, mostly in lower categories. Such a decision showed the anti-employee approach of the UDF government, he said.However, when pointed out that CPI (M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had stated that the decision of the government would be a financial burden on the next government, Mr. Vijayan replied that Mr. Balakrishnan’s words could have been misinterpreted. The government not only delayed in taking a decision on the pay commission recommendations but also robbed the employees of their rightful wages, he said.Solar scamReferring to the solar scam cases, the CPI (M) leader said the testimony of Additional Director General of Police A. Hemachandran confirmed that untoward incidents had taken place at the Chief Minister’s Office. The Chief Minister considers every disclosure made before Justice G. Sivarajan Commission inquiring into the solar scam cases as one more feather in his cap, Mr. Vijayan said.SNDP schemeHe said that a detailed investigation should be carried out by the Vigilance to expose the corruption in the micro-finance scheme run by the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam involving loans procured for disbursement to self-help groups from the Kerala State Backward Development Corporation.
