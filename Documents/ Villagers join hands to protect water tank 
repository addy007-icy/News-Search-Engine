Residents of Thandukaranpalayam village came together in a distinctive manner on Sunday for a double cause.They sow 10,000 palmyra nuts, planted 2,000 saplings of various species on five acres around the water tank, and cleaned it to increase its water holding capacity. The water is mainly used for irrigation purposes.“Uniqueness of the project is that the entire works, including procurement of nuts and saplings, been done as a collective effort of the residents alone. We did not seek any government funds and politicians were not involved,” said K. Sakthivel, Councillor (Independent) of Avinashi Town Panchayat, and a resident of the area.The saplings planted included 'aalamaram', 'arasamaram' and plantain.The palmyra nuts were procured from Tuticorin, and Tirunelveli.P. Santhanakrishnan, a Tirupur-based farmer who retired as Joint Director of Agriculture, said that raising palymra around the water tank was a wise decision.“The fibrous root system of palmyra will be able to prevent soil erosion from the tank bund and thereby, holds the structure intact,” he said.“A person has come forward to provide tree guards,” said Mr. Sakthivel.
