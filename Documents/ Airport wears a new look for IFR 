Delegates from over 50 countries are expected to participate in the International Fleet Review (IFR) to be held from February 4 to 8. Their first point of contact with the city will be the Visakhapatnam International Airport.Thanks to the IFR, the airport will sport a new look, nearly four years after going ‘international’, with colourful water fountains, ornamental plants, re-carpeting of internal roads, green lawns and floral decorations.It may be recalled that the first international flight from the airport was launched by Air India from Visakhapatnam to Dubai (via Hyderabad) way back in March 2012 and Silk Air had introduced a direct flight from Visakhapatnam to Singapore later that year.The introduction of direct flights to Kuala Lumpur by Malindo and later by Air Asia resulted in cut-throat competition between the airline operators operating to Malaysia and Singapore.An airport is the face of the city and the first impression that the foreign delegates get is vital to showcase not only the biggest city in the new State but also the State of Andhra Pradesh. The airport beautification project was taken up by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in association with the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) at an estimated cost of Rs.3.22 crore.“The lighting at the new terminal building has been improved and the front elevation has been redone, the building has been given a facelift with a fresh coat of paint and the internal roads have been re-carpeted. The old control tower, which was damaged during Hudhud, was repaired. The washrooms at the airport have also been renovated,” Airport Director Vinod Sharma said.“The terminal building would be illuminated from February 4 to 8. Additional lights have also been provided at the parking areas. We expect 10 to 15 special chartered flights to bring in the VIPs from different countries. The old apron would be used for parking.”He appealed to passengers to report at the airport two hours before the actual departure of their flight to facilitate hassle-free security check. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has ordered that visitors should not be allowed into the airport till the conclusion of the IFR (February 8) for security reasons.The lighting at the new terminal building has been improved and the front elevation has been redone, the building has been given a facelift with a fresh coat of paint and the internal roads have been re-carpetedVinod SharmaAirport Director
