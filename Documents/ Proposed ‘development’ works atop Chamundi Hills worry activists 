Activists have sounded an alarm over the proposed “development” works at the Chamundi Hills and sought its review to conserve the local ecology and environment.R. Chandra Prakash, president, Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP), and Maj.Gen. Sudhir Vombatkere (retd), social activist, have cautioned that the development plan of the government would destroy what is left of the ecology and environment of the hills.MGP demanded a rational plan for the development of the hills keeping with its unique historical, ecological and environmental characteristics and drew attention to the destruction of heritage areas in the city in the guise of “development”.In a letter to the Chief Minister, they called for saving Chamundi Hills from “destructive development” and drew attention to information, obtained under RTI, which mentioned plans for another Dasoha building, an administrative building, a guest house, a VIP guest house etc at a cost of nearly Rs. 80 crore besides acquiring 8.04 acres of land, which dangered the hills.Activists also referred to the proposed construction of a multi-storeyed parking lot, bus stand, dormitories, commercial complex etc. and other facilities on the lines of Tirupati as examples of bad planning.“A development plan for an eco-sensitive precinct like the Chamundi Hills should be based on the long-term implications of the plan, including the objective of protecting the environment and the religious sensitivity of the people. There is an immediate requirement to clear illegal and unauthorised constructions around the temple, and restore its religious sanctity by reducing commercial and tourist-oriented activities at the top,” said MGP.The outfit also highlighted the crisis plaguing Chamundi Hills due to a slew of developments in recent years and said that the Chamundeshwari temple had been overrun by many illegal or badly planned projects while the dasoha bhavan was having a continuous adverse and environmental impact on the hill.Despite being declared as plastic-free zone, the area was littered with plastic bags and other non-biodegradable wastes, according to the MGP which called for measures to address the existing challenges.
