To showcase that physical barriers cannot limit artistic expressions, 50 visually-impaired students will take to the stage at Kamani Auditorium on Friday to perform in a musical titled ‘Khushi Ek Ehsaas’.The performance will involve acting, singing, dance and use of audio-visuals to depict the world through the eyes of a cat named Khushi.The performing children are from JPM School, a government-aided residential school for visually-impaired children and is managed by the Blind Relief Association.Directed by theatre artist Ritu R. Chandra, the production is the brainchild and vision of Radhika Bharat Ram, the joint secretary of the Blind Relief Association.She came up with the concept while thinking of adding new experiences to the lives of the children at the Blind School.“The idea behind the production is to sensitise society and showcase the potential of our children. This rich learning experience will help our children push boundaries, and enhance their level of confidence and help them become independent,” said Radhika.While it was a challenging task to prepare this play, Ritu said she was overwhelmed and surprised to see how the children worked hard and pushed themselves.This, she added, motivated her to exceed her own capabilities.“The narration is very entertaining and is mounted with the help of songs and dances as well as audio visual assists,” added Ritu.Other artists who have supported the endeavour include photographer Sumiko Nanda, creative designer Amita Chaddha, choreographer Archana Shiromani and designer Payal Pratap Singh.The funds collected from the event will be used to improve infrastructure facilities at the Association.The performance will begin at Kamani Auditorium at 6.30 p.m. on Friday.
