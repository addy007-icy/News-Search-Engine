Thousands thronged the streets of this industrial town on Thursday in response to a call given by the Hosur administration to clean up place.Eight-year-old G. Karthik became the star attraction of the initiative.Born with a congenital deformity, Karthik was spotted cleaning up his locality along with children of his age. The massive clean-up campaign “One Day for Hosur” began on Facebook under the aegis of the Hosur Sub Collector, and the municipality.Karthik is the son of Gopi, a lathe operator in Choolachndram.The FB page under the tagline ‘Orunginaivom Hosur-ukkaga; Ondrupaduvom Hosur-ukkaga; Oru Naal Hosur-ukkaga,’ helped bring close to a lakh of Hosur residents out to the streets for the massive cleanup drive.By evening over 245 tonnes of garbage was collected.On a normal day, Hosur Municipality collects up to 80 tonnes of garbage.Even a group of enthusiasts from Erode, on reading about the initiative, came to Hosur to take part in the cleanup drive, said Senthil Raj, Sub Collector.Though the earthmover operator’s association had pledged support by offering 150 machines free of rent, lack of drivers proved a hurdle. The association, however, managed to deploy 12 earthmovers and 35 lorries.About 675 sanitation workers too participated in the drive.“We plan to continue the campaign on May 1, and October 2, the Sub Collector said.
