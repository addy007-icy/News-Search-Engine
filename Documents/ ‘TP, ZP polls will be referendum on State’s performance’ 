Union Minister for Law and Justice D.V. Sadananda Gowda has asked Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to show his contribution to his home town Mysuru during his two-year tenure.Mr. Gowda said that all the Chief Ministers of Karnataka have contributed to their home town in one or the other remarkable way. He said he too had contributed a lot to Dakshina Kannada when he was the Chief Minister. Development works have come to a standstill and law and order has collapsed in the State, he alleged.The ensuing elections to the taluk and zilla panchayat would be a referendum on the performance of the government, he said.Mr. Gowda said that the Union government has come to the rescue of sugarcane growers and decided to provide interest-free loans to them through the State governments. Accordingly, Rs. 400 crore has been released to Karnataka and 12 factories have taken over Rs. 180 crore to be distributed to farmers, he said.
