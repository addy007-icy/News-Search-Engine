: Even as Kerala sees a rise in donation of organs of brain-dead persons, the facilities and skills to harvest and transplant organs are restricted to three or four major cities.Shortage of well-equipped centres and surgeons trained in transplantation is hampering the intended spread of the organ sharing programme of the State government.“We had 48 cases of donation (live unrelated donors) in 2014 and it rose to 75 in 2015,” says Noble Gracious, Nodal Officer, Kerala Network of Organ Sharing.“But all these were done at the limited number of transplantation centres that we have in the State,” he told The Hindu.Even organ harvesting is done only in hospitals that have the skill and facilities to carry out transplantation. Most of the peripheral hospitals are non-transplantation centres that perform routine surgeries. Barring a couple of these near Ernakulam, the others cannot facilitate even harvesting of major organs because their operation theatres are not equipped for it.Modern ICUsThey do not have modern intensive care units to preserve brain-dead persons for 24 to 48 hours for assessment of brain-death and organ harvest.“This is why many non-transplantation centres do not even report brain deaths to the organ sharing network,” Dr. Gracious says.“Many brain-death cases are not converted into organ donors due to this constraint. Yet, the best is made out of whatever is available in the present situation.“We need to have more retrieval centres so that organs are not wasted. There are many persons waitlisted for transplantation, and spending huge money on survival,” he says.The other key area is building transplantation skills in surgeons.The present lot of transplantation experts are those trained at major centres abroad, or in those very few ones in the country“Any liver surgeon cannot do transplantation of the organ,” Dr. Gracious says, hinting that total retrieval of the liver and transplantation is not like removing the cancer-affected portion of the organ. “Transplantation must become a super-specialty course with a well-structured curriculum.”
