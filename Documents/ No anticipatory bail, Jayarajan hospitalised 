The hospitalisation of Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary P. Jayarajan at the party-controlled AKG Hospital here on Tuesday night after the district and sessions court at Thalassery rejected the anticipatory bail application he filed apprehending arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team investigating the murder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary E. Manoj has set the stage for what is said to be a re-enactment of a situation similar to the one that emerged here six months ago.Mr. Jayarajan was hospitalised around 9 p.m. on Tuesday after he reportedly showed signs of physical exhaustion. That the hospitalisation took place a few hours after the court dismissed his application is not lost on political circles. Mr. Jayarajan’s hospitalisation in July last year in the aftermath of his interrogation by the CBI team in Thiruvananthapuram on June 2 is still fresh in people’s minds.That time Mr. Jayarajan was admitted to Pariyaram Medical College Hospital reportedly for a heart-related ailment. He was later shifted to AKG Hospital for physiotherapy when the district and sessions court was hearing his earlier anticipatory bail plea in the same case. The court had then too rejected his plea.CBI’s next action?This time the hospitalisation followed the rejection of his fresh plea. What direction the present situation will take is still a matter of conjecture. CBI sources are tight-lipped about whether or not the investigating team will serve a fresh notice on Mr. Jayarajan to appear before it for questioning. Though he was not yet listed as an accused in the murder case, his apprehension, as explained in his anticipatory bail application, is that the CBI may arrest and harass him with a political motive.
