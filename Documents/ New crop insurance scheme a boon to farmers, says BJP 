The new Crop Insurance Scheme ('Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana) cleared by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday comes as a great relief to farmers, particularly in States like Andhra Pradesh where drought and cyclones are a regular phenomenon, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders said here on Thursday. It will come into force on April 1.The applicability of insurance to post-harvest losses, loss caused by spurious seeds and low premium are major attractions of the scheme, said BJP State general secretary J. Syam Kishore. Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Kishore said 25 per cent of the sum insured was targeted to be paid immediately and balance would be reimbursed within 90 days. Enumeration of loss would be done in a smart way i.e. through cellphones, he said.25 p.c. of the sum insured will be paid immediately and the balance will be reimbursed within 90 days
