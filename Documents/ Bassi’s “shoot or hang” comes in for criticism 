An NGO has hit out at the Delhi Police commissioner’s recent remark that his force would not mind shooting or hanging on the spot the perpetrators of crimes against women if permitted by the Constitution.B.S. Bassi had made the statement during the Delhi Police’s annual conference on Monday. He was speaking about the mindset of sexual abusers when he ventured to give this opinion.Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), a Delhi-based NGO, on Wednesday said it was “deeply perturbed” by the Commissioner’s statement.“While he (Bassi) immediately conceded that the Constitution does not allow this and the police is bound to uphold human rights, it is disturbing that the leadership of one of the largest police forces in the world appears to endorse tactics akin to extrajudicial killings that by-pass due process,” said CHRI.The police must remain impartial even if there is a growing tide of public opinion clamouring for mob justice, the NGO said.Revealing his reading of the mindset of sex predators, the police chief had said that each locality has between 250 to 400 men who look at women around them in the same way as they see women in a porn film.
