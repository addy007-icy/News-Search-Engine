Tamil Nadu Cricket Association secretary K.S. Viswanathan is quite happy that former IPL COO Sundar Raman has been cleared of all charges and given a clean chit by the Lodha Committee.“Sundar being given a clean chit also goes to show that N. Srinivasan (former BCCI president) was clean as an administrator and person. There were so many false accusations made against him (Sundar),” said Viswanathan, who is here for the BCCI’s annual awards function.“He (Sundar) was castigated for no reason. He had a harrowing time in the last two years,” said another seasoned administrator from South Zone.The BCCI will ask its Legal Committee chairman P.S. Raman to study the Lodha Committee report and advise the way forward. Other members of the Legal Committee are Abhay Apte and D.V.S.S. Somayajulu. Most probably the BCCI will circulate the report to its 30 members and ask them to revert with opinions of their legal counsels.
