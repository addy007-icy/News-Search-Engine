A Delhi court has awarded 10 years of imprisonment to the security guard of the Ashiana Children’s Home at Alipur in Outer Delhi for sodomising a seven-year-old HIV positive boy at the Home in 2013.The court also granted a compensation of Rs. 2 lakh to the victim.Though the medical examination said that the accused tested negative in the HIV test and no semen and blood of the accused was found on the victim’s swab, the court held accused Amardeep Kajur guilty.“Merely because no semen or blood of the accused was found on the anal swab of the victim cannot be a reason to exonerate the accused as the anal swab of the victim was taken many days after the incidents of sexual assault. Furthermore, it is not necessary that if an anal sex is done with an HIV positive person then the person doing so, would essentially be transmitted HIV,” Additional Sessions Judge Gautam Manan said.Describing the victim’s testimony as reliable, truthful and trustworthy, Mr. Manan held the accused guilty on his statement alone.The court also rejected the plea for a lenient punishment by the accused on the ground that he was a first-time offender. The Alipur police had lodged a case in the matter on a letter sent by the Child Welfare Committee. Earlier, an NGO had sent a report to the Committee in this regard.
