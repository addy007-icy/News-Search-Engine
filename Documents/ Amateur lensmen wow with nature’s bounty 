: When dozen-odd wild photographers gathered at Lalitakala Akademi Art Gallery at Kottakkunnu on Friday, the result was an amazing turnout of curious onlookers. Everyone who dropped in to the art gallery was treated to a wide variety of wildlife found in different parts of the State.“Wow. It’s amazing,” commented a foreign tourist couple, when they learnt that most of the photographers were amateurs. The pictures on display were given no technical details.“It is our amateurism that makes this exhibition special,” said Saju B., motor vehicle inspector here.
