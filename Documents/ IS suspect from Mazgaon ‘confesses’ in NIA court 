Alleged Islamic State (IS) member Mohammad Hussain Jamil Khan, who was arrested from Mazagaon on Friday, confessed in front of a National Investigation Agency (NIA) holiday court, where he was produced for remand on Saturday.Khan, the 15th suspect arrested by the central agency in a nationwide sweep, is a businessman and lives with two wives and four daughters at Mazagaon’s Mandvi lane.Similar to Mudabbir Shaikh, another alleged IS member arrested from Mumbra who was granted transit remand of three days, public prosecutor Anand Sukhdeve sought transit remand for Khan as well.Asked by Judge NK More if he wanted to say anything on his arrest, Khan said “Mujhse galti ho gayi, Sir” (I have made a mistake, Sir).Advocate Shabnam Shaikh, appearing for Khan, alleged that the businessman, who was reportedly in touch with Mudabbir Shaikh, the ring leader of the group, had been framed in the case. “He made his confession under pressure. He has been falsely implicated,” she said.Khan’s second wife, also present in the court, pleaded that her husband was innocent. She said he had lost his father several years ago and had the financial responsibility of three families.As the news of his arrest reached the family, Khan’s family and well-wishers rushed to the court.Speaking to the media, Khan’s wife, unwilling to disclose her name, said the family was shocked to know of his arrest. They were informed of his arrest after 12 hours, she added. He was detained by the NIA and the ATS on Friday evening.“We are clueless about why he has been arrested but are sure that he is innocent,” she said, adding that two of his four daughters were of marriageable age.On Khan’s confession in the court, his wife said enforcement agencies might have put pressure on him to make such a statement.The court granted three days’ transit remand for Khan to be produced before Patiala Court in New Delhi .
