The 33rd Swacch Mangaluru Abhiyan was carried out in the Nanthoor area under the auspices of Ramakrishna Mission on Sunday.Volunteers cleaned Nanthoor main circle which was full of weeds and mud.The circle which stands like an entrance to Mangalore was poorly maintained. The weeds, the mud and other garbage were removed using earthmovers.Three road dividers along the National Highway were cleaned and the garbage dumped in the area were removed.The bus shelter near the circle wore an ugly look due to the posters stuck on the walls and the garbage dumped in the shelter.
