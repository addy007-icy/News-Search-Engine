Very few events can disturb the pace of life on Thana Street. The busy street at Purasawalkam has vegetable vendors, fruit sellers and rows of shops on both sides with the constant whir of vehicles. For them, anything out of the ordinary alone merits a glance. Down the road, a stage was set and Pattali Makkal Katchi’s Anbumani Ramadoss took to the mike.Attired in jeans and T-shirt, the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate was at the second stop of his three-day campaign ‘The Chennai We Want’. He had begun close to his residence in T. Nagar early that morning.Dr. Anbumani, by setting up stage in the locality, was throwing a challenge to its essential character. Business went on as usual, the marketplace buzzed with activity.Not one to be fazed by this, he went on to say it was not part of his political campaign and that he had come on behalf of the NGO Pasumai Thaayakam, working on environmental issues. Then he spoke of the history of the city, its proud moments, the recent flood and its ghastly aftermath.On the footpath nearby, an elderly woman, responded as if he had been speaking only to her: “Take my name. Sivakami. I did not get the relief amount.” Dr. Anbumani charged that it was a man-made disaster and the government had failed the people.
