: With the elections just round the corner in Tamil Nadu, the People’s Welfare Front, or the third front, comprising of VCK, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Left parties, is all set to begin its campaign on February 7 in the delta districts.“We will begin our campaign by promising the people corruption free, liquor free and a transparent government. The young people of Tamil Nadu have lost trust in the DMK and the AIADMK . A coalition arrangement will ensure that there is no abuse of power by a single party. We might not have their financial power, but we have credibility that DMK and AIADMK don’t have,” claimed Vaiko, leader of MDMK and co-ordinator of the PWF on Thursday.The first phase of the campaign trail, which is likely to run through Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Sivaganga, will feature Thol. Thirumavalavan (VCK), Vaiko, G. Ramakrishnan (CPI-M) and Mutharasan (CPI).
