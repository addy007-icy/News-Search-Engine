Can mothers participate in runs with their babies?Some women proved that they can, braving the Sunday morning chill with their babies in tow. And they had model, actor and founder of Pinkathon, Milind Soman, giving them company at Cubbon Park here on Sunday for the ‘Baby Wearing Walk’.Conducted by the SBI Pinkathon-Empowering Indian Women, the event aimed to emphasise the importance of activity during pregnancy and the post-natal period.Mr. Soman said, “We want to change the mindset of new mothers and urge them to lead a healthy life and break the stereotype of woman with infants having to stay at home. The walk is for the urban woman to understand that it is important to take their children along with them as they carry on with their lives.”SBI Pinkathon, a women’s run created with the specific purpose of getting more women to adopt a fitter lifestyle for themselves and their families and to highlight the need for increased awareness about breast cancer, will be held on January 31 at the KTPO Trade Centre here.
