The Internal Security Division (ISD), formed as a nodal agency for all security issues in Karnataka following the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has been come severe criticism time and again for not doing enough.‘Punishment transfer’Posting in the agency is even today seen as a punishment transfer. For instance, days after senior IPS officer Alok Kumar was suspended following a lottery scam, he was posted to the ISD under suspension. Its present chief, T. Sunil Kumar, also holds additional charge of Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF), and is dividing his time between the two agencies.The ISD and the Anti-Terror Squad under it in Karnataka have no powers to make arrests, unlike their counterparts in States such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat.A senior official said it was high time the ISD was reinvented as a functional body with investigating powers, and be declared a police station.
