It was a fine vocal expression by Ranjani sisters from Srirangam during the carnatic music concert held at the Thyagaraja Mandiram here.The teenagers from Tamil Nadu, Sruthi Ranjani and Smruthi Ranjani, who had earned the epithet ‘wonder kids’ kept the audience spellbound singing the famous ‘kritis’ of saint-composer Thyagaraja starting with Ganpathi Stuthi during the Thyagaraja Aradhana.They were ably assisted by 13-year-old N. Hariprasad (mridangam) and 14-year-old Harish Narayanan (violin).The sisters won a wow from connoisseurs for flawless pronunciation of ‘kirtanas’ in chaste Telugu by the saint-composer, one of the trinity of Carnatic music hailing from Kakarla village in Prakasam district, during the concert late on Sunday night.The sisters aged 12 years and 14 years had learnt the nuances of carnatic music from violinist T.V. Ramanujacharlu.
