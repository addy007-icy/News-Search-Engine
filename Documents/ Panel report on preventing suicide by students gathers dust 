How should universities cope with the issue of students from rural impoverished background getting into depression mode due to academic pressure, discrimination, and harassment? The question assumes importance in the backdrop of the suicide of a young research scholar of Hyderabad Central University Rohith Vemula.While the University Grants Commission (UGC) has clear-cut norms, the UGC (Promotion of equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012, nearer home, a committee constituted in 2013 by the then High Court for undivided Andhra Pradesh has come out with a list of short and long-term recommendations to tackle the problem. But apparently not many universities seemed to be following these well-meaning provisions and recommendations.Applicable to all higher educational institutions in the country, the UGC’s guidelines are fairly elaborate including steps for creating a level playing filed for all students, safeguarding their interests without any prejudice to their caste, creed, religion, language, ethnicity, gender and disability and a long list of do and don’ts to prevent discrimination, harassment and victimisation of students, especially those belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.An Anti-Discrimination Officer in each institution of higher education should look into the written complaint of discrimination or harassment and recommend appropriate action in accordance with the provision of the statutes, regulation or service rules. “The punishment shall be commensurate with the nature of discrimination or harassment.” The recommendations of the committee constituted by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh after initiating a PIL suo motu based on reports of newspapers, appear equally effective. The committee comprises of Vice-Chancellor of NALSAR and academicians from Hyderabad Central University, EFLU and Osmania University. The court directed all the Vice-Chancellors of the universities in the State to implement these recommendations given in the report on June 25, 2013, as early as possible. Of particular relevance in the present context is their recommendation on referring all cases of students’ detention or expulsion by disciplinary committee to the Student Grievance Committee before taking such a decision. To hear appeals against the decision of the SGC and other complaints against the university, the university should put in place University Ombudsman, in accordance with the UGC regulations. The committee suggested that the UGC constitute a task force to prevent suicides, on the lines of anti-ragging committee to monitor academic and emotional distress. Each instance of the suicide should be investigated by an internal committee constituted by the university with adequate representation from SC, ST, OBC and minority communities.Another recommendation was on how big universities should constitute Academic Grievance Committee at department-level (rather than the university-level ) to be able to deliver the desired result. To tackle the problem of academic pressure, the committee wanted all universities in the State to put in place preparatory courses, bridge courses, (including peer learning system wherever possible) to support SC, ST,OBC students, students with disabilities, first generation learners and economically backward students.The committee also wanted the universities to explore the possibility of using Restorative Justice Techniques which have been successfully used by the NALSAR University of Law here.
