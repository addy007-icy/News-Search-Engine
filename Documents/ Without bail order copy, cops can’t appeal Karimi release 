Four days after Salim Karimi obtained bail from a Metropolitan Magistrate’s court, Mumbai police have still not been able to file their appeal against the decision due to delay in receiving a signed copy of the bail order from the court.A US national of Indian origin, Karimi, 50, is wanted in a multi-million dollar fraud case in the US. He was detained at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on December 26 last year while trying to board a flight to Mexico, based on a Red Corner Notice issued against him by the US. On January 4 this year, he was granted bail by the Esplanade Court on a personal bond of Rs 15,000.Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has already begun the process of extraditing him to the US, and the police are now concerned of being faced with an internationally embarrassing situation if Karimi goes missing in the meantime.When Karimi walked out of jail a day later on January 5, officers from the Mumbai Police Crime Branch found themselves unable to file an appeal in the Sessions Court as they were waiting for the Esplanade Court to send a copy of the order.“What is worrying is that Karimi’s bail does not impose any conditions on him, such as having to report to the nearest police station periodically, which also means that there is no legal basis for us to control his movements,” said a senior crime branch officer.Sources said after a four-day wait, the Crime Branch finally received a copy of the order on Friday, and is drafting the appeal in consultation with legal experts. If the process takes more than a day, the appeal will only be filed on Monday, as Sunday is a holiday.“While Karimi may not be able to leave the country as long as we have his passport, he can easily disappear within India. If he disappears, the entire extradition process will collapse ,” the officer said.Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Atulchandra Kulkarni said, “We are working on filing an appeal against Karimi’s bail.”Karimi is wanted in the US for allegedly defrauding the City of Los Angeles of millions of dollars by submitting fraudulent bills for affordable housing projects, for which he was awarded contracts by the city’s municipal authorities. He is alleged to have transferred a part of the money to accounts in India. He fled the US in 2010 and has been staying in India ever since.
