Whistle for Public Interest (WHIP), a group representing public-spirited law students, has submitted a representation to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) demanding the supply of answer-sheets to students under the Right to Information Act, 2005, at the cost of Rs.2 per page instead of an exorbitant fee of Rs.1,000 per subject, which it is charging at present.The memorandum, submitted to CBSE Chairman Y.S.K. Seshu Kumar, pointed out that the Supreme Court had held in 2011 that every student had the fundamental and legal right to access his or her answer-sheets under the RTI Act.The apex court had held in the case of CBSE vs. Aditya Bandhopadhyay that the answer book was a document of record.
