Ruling Congress MLA from Mangaluru South and former bureaucrat J.R. Lobo on Tuesday took everyone at the Invest Dakshina Kannada meeting by surprise when he criticised the government for not creating an investor-friendly environment in Dakshina Kannada despite the district having many advantages.“Existing industries in the district are bogged down by several problems and those in Bengaluru [the government] do not have patience to hear grievances. Everyone is immersed in one’s problems,” he said at the inauguration of the business meet.“The government has to discharge its duties with an open mind. Let it provide water, road and power; the rest investors would look after,” he said. At the same time, the government should also ensure that the rule of law prevails.“Let it also invite some big IT firms to the region, the rest would follow,” Mr. Lobo demanded.He said that an IT Park has been formed at Mudipu, off Mangaluru. However, not many companies have evinced interest in setting up shop because the roads are not good. Development activities in the Coastal Regulatory Zone are prohibited thereby preventing promotion of tourism.When some industries intend to come here, environmentalists make a hue and cry. The ship-building industry is in doldrums; Bharati Ship Yard, which once employed 500 graduate engineers, is on the verge of closure. No one hears their grievances, Mr. Lobo lamented.Social harmonyEarlier, inaugurating the meet, district in-charge Minister B. Ramanath Rai urged people to ensure a conducive environment to attract investment by maintaining social harmony. The district has abundant talent and manpower which have to be harnessed properly, he said.At the same time, he said that politicians should not become businessmen and businessmen should not enter politics. Such a situation would be conducive to the growth of entrepreneurship, he said.In all, the district has attracted investment proposals worth Rs. 11,946 crore, with a lion’s share coming from MRPL which intends to set up an LNG Terminal at the New Mangalore Port, upgrade the refineries and enhance production capacity to 18,000 million tonnes.Mangaluru North MLA B.A. Mohiuddin Bava, Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat president Asha Thimmappa Gowda, Mangaluru Mayor Jacinta Vijaya Alfred and district in-charge Secretary Bharat Lal Meena were present.
