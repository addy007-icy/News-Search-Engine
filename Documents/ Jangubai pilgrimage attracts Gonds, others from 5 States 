For the Gond Adivasis in the country, the Jangubai pilgrimage is a major event associated not only with their religion but their socio-cultural evolution. Jangubai, or Raitaar Jango, is the sadar pen or the chief goddess of eight Gond sagas or clans and therefore the most revered of all the mythological personalities in Adivasi ethos.The current phase in time being the sacred poos month as per Gondi calendar when the pilgrimage season is scheduled, a lot of logistical activity as part of this largest Adivasi segment can be seen in and around the picturesque hilly wilderness on the Telangana-Maharashtra border in Kerameri mandal of Adilabad district.Hundreds of Gonds from the States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Telangana are visiting the Jangubai temple located in a set of four caves on a cliff on the banks of a hill stream, access to which has slightly improved this year, thanks to chopping off some part of a ghat section on the approaches to the sacred spot.According to Gondi folklore, Jangubai and Pahandi Pari Kuphar Lingo gave the Gonds their social structure. Together they rescued gods of the 12 Gond clans who were imprisoned at the caves at Kachargadh, now in Maharashtra, by Lord Shiva.Jangubai could not get a priest to serve her cult despite her effort in saving the Gond gods which made her seek favour for one from God Mahadev, according to Professor Christopher von Furer-Haimendorf, who recorded Jangubai’s legend in some detail in his book The Aboriginal Tribes of Hyderabad , its third volume being The Raj Gonds of Adilabad . It was Jangubai who founded the Sarpe saga or eight new clans of Gonds before making the cave temple at Kota-Parandoli her abode.“The Sarpe saga comprises the clans Tumram, Kodapa, Raisidam, Salam, Vetti, Here Kumre, Marapa and Mandadi, each of which has a kathoda or a priest, all conducting proceedings during the holy month at the Jangubai temple, known as her mahal or palace. There is only an oil lamp which is lit for the period and represents the deity in her mahal,” revealed Here Kumre Rama Rao, the Kathoda of that clan.The spot can be accessed from Lokari in Narnoor mandal and Kerameri mandal headquarters in Adilabad district besides from Rajura Tahsil in Maharashtra. The nearly 20 km of tar and kutcha road from Lokari consists of a driver winding through and steeply climbing ghat road between Umri via Parandoli tanda and Maharajguda.
