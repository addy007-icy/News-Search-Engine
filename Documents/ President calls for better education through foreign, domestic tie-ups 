President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday stressed on the need to arrest the declining standard of education in the country.“Multiple interventions are necessary. Attracting quality faculty and continuous faculty development is one. Adjunct faculty from the industry and research institutions, if hired, can provide practical orientation to course modules,” he said.Inaugurating the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and the 26th Convocation of the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, here, Mr Mukherjee said through promoting centres of excellence, core competencies of an institute can be nurtured.“Through the establishment of research parks, cutting-edge research can be pursued and that will help develop a world class eco-system in our institutions,” he said.The President said that institutes can also pursue establishment of partnerships with foreign and domestic institutions by signing Memoranda of Understanding.He said there was a need for giving a boost to start-ups to provide a head-start to various innovative activities.“Due to facilitated environments that have evolved, the youth today has a greater share for entrepreneurship. Many start-ups in India have become successful and have shown the path of progress to others,” the President said.In fact, India with over 4,200 start-ups, has the third largest start-ups eco-system in the world, behind the U.S. and the U.K., Mr Mukherjee said.He asserted that higher academic institutions have a clear role to play in refining the entrepreneurial abilities of their students.Other support measures like small industries, entrepreneurs’ park of BIT in Mesra, are needed to prepare students to become ‘job creators’ rather than ‘job seekers’, Mr Mukherjee said. After presentation of Ph.D, Post-Graduation and Graduation degrees to the students, the President presented gold medals to those topping various branches of engineering at the institute.In his address, Mr Mukherjee said that creating inter-linkages with other higher education institutions can deliver benefits in terms of resource sharing like academic experts and course material, exchange of students and faculty, scope for research collaboration and sharing of new ideas and best practices.“Towards this end, it will be worthwhile to properly harness the existing information and communication technology networks like the National Knowledge Network,” he said.Noting that higher education sector in the country has seen enormous growth over the last few decades, he said a healthy feature of this expansion is the increasing participation of the private sector.The percentage of students enrolled for higher education in private institutions has risen from 54 per cent at the beginning of the 11th plan period to 59 per cent at the commencement of the 12th plan period, he said. However, he said that proliferation in this sector has resulted in greater access, but has led to an alarming distress in quality at the same time. -- PTI
