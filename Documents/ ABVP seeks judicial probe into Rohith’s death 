The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has demanded a judicial enquiry into the suicide of RohithVemula at the University of Hyderabad to bring out the ‘real’ truth behind the entire episode.The ABVP all-India general secretary Vinay Bidre accused ‘ultra leftists’ working on the campus of misleading the nation and instigating students using the caste card. “Rohith’s suicide was unfortunate and we feel extremely sad about it. What was an issue between two student groups has been given a caste colour and a group of people are using the emotions to blame ABVP,” he said at a press conference here on Wednesday.He said the ABVP will launch a ‘truth campaign’ across the country in all universities, colleges and expose the real truth also through roadside meetings till February 2. “We were not active in expressing our views all these days to respect Rohith and not exploit the emotions,” he said.We want to expose the Ambedkar Students Association that is defaming Dr. Ambedkar by twisting his ideology and supporting anti-national elements. Mr. Bidre also alleged some teachers with Maoist ideology and those who openly support terrorists were infusing anti-national feelings among students. Police should enquire about the non-boarders staying on the campus and discreetly working to poison the atmosphere, he said adding that an inquiry was needed to study the role of some teachers in poisoning the minds of students using caste and religion.Mr. Bidre said he was surprised by the change in the police stand on the attack on Sushil Kumar and wanted to know if they were influenced by any and whom.“We have the FIR copy where police clearly admitted that Sushil was attacked and now they changed their stand.” The entire episode should be enquired by a judicial commission and ABVP was ready to provide the details it has on the case.He argued that there was not much support to the agitators from the HCU students and majority wants class work to go on but some groups are threatening them with attacks if they raise their voice.Some teachers with Maoist ideology and those who openly support terrorists are infusing anti-national feelings among students.Vinay Bidre,ABVP all-India general secretary
