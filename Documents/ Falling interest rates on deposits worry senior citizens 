Though the banks offer 0.5 per cent extra on FDs to senior citizens, several elderly argue that the interest offered was inadequate.The interest rate, which had gone up to 12 per cent a decade ago, has come down to as low as 7.25 per cent. There is a slight difference in the interest rates offered from bank to bank, but the difference was insignificant, they claim.“In the absence of a robust pension scheme after retirement, several pensioners depend on the monthly interest they earn from their term deposits,” said a member of the Senior Citizens Forum, Mysuru.“In the wake of rising prices of essential commodities and medical expenses, the income what we earn from term deposits is scarce,” said forum secretary R. M. Chetty.The Forum has mailed a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, urging him to make a special provision in the forthcoming Union budget to enhance the rates by at least 2 per cent from the existing 0.5 per cent.“The issue is not just the money, but security that is a key for their sustenance,” he said.Though some private banks offer attractive rates, the elderly don’t want to take any risk, he said.When contacted, Lead Bank Manager K. N. Shivalingaiah told The Hind, “The interest rates are policy matters decided by the Reserve Bank of India. For various reasons, the rates were slashed and the percentage variess from one bank to another..”
