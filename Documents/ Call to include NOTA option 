Taking umbrage to dropping of None Of The Above (NOTA) option in the GHMC elections, several civil society groups have launched a petition demanding the choice be made available to the voters.Lubna Sarwath of Hum-Hyderabadi said they attempted to have the issue sorted out with the GHMC administrators and on Tuesday approached the Lok Ayukta through mail seeking intervention and steps to have the option restored.During meetings with Telangana State Election Commission in December last year, the representatives of the NGO, Election Watch were assured that the NOTA provision would be made available in the GHMC elections, she said adding, “surprisingly, the GHMC officials announced that it was not there. It is shocking.” By denying the right to NOTA, the authorities were denying the voters a right mandated by the Supreme Court, she said.
