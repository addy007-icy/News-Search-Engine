While asking the Aam Aadmi Party government to improve the condition of its schools, the Delhi High Court on Monday issued notices on two writ petitions moved by private schools seeking quashing of the January 6 order scrapping 62 criteria, including management quota, for nursery admissions.The Bench of Justice Manmohan observed that the Delhi government seemed to be trying to take over the admission process of private unaided schools instead of properly administering its own schools. The Delhi government must “set its house in order”, said the court, adding that this would avert the need for people to rush to private schools.The writ petitions of the Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools have challenged the Delhi government’s decision, saying it was “arbitrary and whimsical” and would impact the autonomy of private schools to regulate their admissions.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on the other hand, stated after issuance of the January 6 order that the management quota gave way to backdoor entry and referred to it as the “biggest scam in education”.The court said the January 6 order had not been passed under any statute. “There is too much confusion. The admission process has already begun, why have you come up with the office order at the last minute?” asked Justice Manmohan.Delhi government counsel Guru Krishna Kumar told the Bench that the government was willing to allay all concerns regarding the move in its reply affidavit. While the government had asked the schools to upload the admission criteria on their websites by December 8 last year, it was uploaded only by December-end, he said.The court posted the case for further hearing on January 28, while clarifying in its order that the parents could continue to fill out application forms as per the criteria uploaded on websites by the schools. However, the scrutiny of applications would be subject to further orders passed in the writ petitions in due course, said the court.The Bench also pointed out that the High Court, in its November 28, 2014 judgment striking down the point system of nursery admissions devised by the Lieutenant Governor for private unaided schools had asked the Delhi government to amend the statute.The Delhi government will file its response to the court notice in a week. The two associations, representing a large number of private unaided schools in the Capital, contended that the autonomy of schools with regard to nursery admissions had been upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court in the past.In its January 6 order, the AAP government had scrapped 62 “arbitrary and discriminatory” criteria listed by schools on their websites for admissions, but had retained the 25 per cent quota for students belonging to economically weaker sections.In its January 6 order, the AAP government had scrapped 62 “arbitrary and discriminatory” criteria listed by schools
