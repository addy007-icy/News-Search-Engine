Jathas are the toast of the political season in Kerala. As many as five jathas, led by prominent leaders from all sides of the political spectrum, would take to the roads linking the two ends of Kerala next week.Janaraksha YatraThe first off the block would be Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president V.M. Sudheeran, who would set out on his Janaraksha Yatra from Kumbla in Kasaragod on Monday. The march, which concludes on February 9 in the State capital after covering all the 140 Assembly constituencies, would flag issues such as fascist threat and rising intolerance and seek to educate the people on the achievements of the Oommen Chandy government and the ‘anti-people’ policies of the Narendra Modi government, particularly the liquor policy which has resulted in sharp curbs on sale of liquor in the State.Navakerala YatraCommunist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan would be the next to hit the road. He would set out on a Navakerala Yatra from Manjeswaram on January 15, armed with the outcomes of the Fourth International Congress on Kerala Studies being held here on January 9 and 10. Mr. Vijayan’s yatra would conclude in the capital on February 14. The yatra is significant given the speculations about who would lead the CPI(M) and Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Assembly elections and, in that sense, it is the most significant among the jathas politically.BJP jathaThe third most significant jatha would be that to be led by the newly appointed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president Kummanam Rajendran, who would set out on January 20 and conclude it on February 9 after covering all the 140 constituencies in search of a major political space for his party in the State based on a charge sheet against both the United Democratic Front and LDF.CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran would set out on his yatra on January 27 and cover the State by February 27.Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader and Industries Minister P.K. Kunhalikutty would also begin a yatra on January 24 and conclude it in the capital on February 11.Smaller parties such as the Indian National League (INL), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Forward Bloc are also planning to take out marches.
