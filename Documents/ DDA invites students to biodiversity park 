The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is inviting school children to the Yamuna Biodiversity Park to promote awareness about the environment and ecology.About 100 students from Prerna School in Moti Bagh, which is run by the IAS Officers’ Wives Association, visited the park on Wednesday.“In our efforts to promote environmental education and nature conservation, we invite school children and college students to the Yamuna and Aravali Biodiversity parks and also provide the facility of camping and an overnight stay. We also extend the invitation to poor children and orphanages to educate children from all strata,” a DDA spokesperson said.In fact, the DDA has established a network of biodiversity parks in Delhi in collaboration with the Delhi University. “The concept of a biodiversity park first evolved in Delhi and was implemented by the DDA, which has already notified six such parks. Of these, two (Yamuna and Aravali Biodiversity Parks) are fully functional and have become nature reserves of Delhi,” the spokesperson said.“These parks are unique urban landscapes that preserve natural heritage including vanishing flora and fauna. The Yamuna and Aravali biodiversity parks have already been providing ecological services to Delhi, such as buffering the local weather, recharging groundwater, trapping dust, sequestering carbon dioxide and assimilating pollutants, besides serving as a habitat for a range of plant and animal species including migratory birds,” he added.“The Yamuna and the Delhi Ridge, which once offered ecological services to the society, have lost their life-supporting potential. In such a scenario, there is a need to raise awareness among people towards nature conservation and the services provided by natural ecosystems,” he said.The Yamuna Biodiversity Park boasts 860 species groups of terrestrial plants, 98 aquatic plants, 192 birds, 75 butterflies, 18 herpetofauna, 18 mammals and 18 fishes. The Aravali Biodiversity Park, meanwhile, has 880 species groups of terrestrial plants, 31 aquatic plants, 189 birds, 104 butterflies, 25 herpetofauna and 17 mammals.The Yamuna Biodiversity Park boasts 860 species groups of terrestrial plants, 98 aquatic plants, 192 birds and 75 butterflies
