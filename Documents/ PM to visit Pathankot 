Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the Pathankot airbase in Punjab on Saturday, exactly a week after a terrorist attack at the site, as formal sanitisation operations ended there on Friday. PMO sources confirmed that Mr. Modi will be leaving for Pathankot on Saturday morning.Last Saturday at least six terrorists sneaked into the Air Base and ended up claiming the lives of seven security men and clean up operation that lasted a better part of the week. The Attack came after the Prime Minister's surprise Christmas visit to Lahore to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that was to be followed by the Foreign Secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan around January 15.Following the incident, the National Security Advisors (NSA) of both countries have spoken on the phone as have the two Prime Ministers. The PMO officials said that Prime Minister Modi had done some tough talking on the issue of taking action against those who were behind the attack based on the evidence gathered by the National Investigative Agency and Indian security forces.The External Affairs Ministry had on Thursday also taken that line and said that the “ball was in Pakistan's court now.”
