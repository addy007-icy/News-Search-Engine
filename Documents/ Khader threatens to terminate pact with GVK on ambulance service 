The State government has threatened to terminate agreement with GVK EMRI, a private agency, that runs the ‘108’ ambulance service if it failed to ensure quality and disciplined service.At a press conference here on Friday, Health and Family Welfare Minister U.T. Khader warned that the staff of the ‘108’ ambulance had not been providing efficient service. “Taking patients to private hospitals, poor maintenance of vehicles, wearing dirty clothes, and parking ambulances outside hotels etc. are not good signs” from the view point of public, he said.The ambulance staff have threatened to go on strike from next week seeking higher pay.“We will run ambulance service, let them go on strike. Lack of discipline will not be tolerated. We will take action against GVK,” the Minister said, and threatened to terminate the contract with the private firm if the latter failed to provide quality service.The Minister said an order was issued on January 14, 2016, for increasing the salary of emergency medical technicians and pilots for the ambulance service. The order would be kept in abeyance if the staff goes on strike next week.The increased salary costs the State exchequer Rs. 6.64 crore a year, he said.The Minister said a group with the ‘108’ ambulance employees had been blackmailing the government and encouraging drivers to go on strike.
