The fast-dwindling water level in Wyra reservoir is a cause of concern for the ayacutdars of the medium irrigation project, which is also a prime source of livelihood for scores of fishermen of Wyra and its neighbouring mandals.The water level in the reservoir continued to hover below seven feet as against its full reservoir level of 18 feet in the middle of rabi season.The fast depleting level in the reservoir is gradually pushing up the demand for replenishing the water body, which is also the major drinking water source for several villages in Wyra and its adjoining mandals.The ayacutdars held a protest under the aegis of the Telangana Rythu Sangham in Wyra a week ago demanding immediate filling up of the reservoir with Krishna water from the Nagarjunasagar project (NSP).The State government has devised an action plan to make Wyra reservoir an integral part of its water grid scheme for supplying drinking water to several mandals in Khammam and Kothagudem divisions, says Nunna Nageswara Rao, Assistant Secretary, Telangana Rythu Sangham.The farmers in the projectâ€™s ayacut area spread on about 20,000 acres are already facing a bleak future due to the recurring problem of water scarcity in the reservoir, he points out, adding that the government should evolve a permanent mechanism to ensure availability of adequate water in the reservoir to fully meet the irrigation needs of the ayacutdars.A fixed quantum of Krishna water should be allocated to the Wyra reservoir from the Palair reservoir to find a lasting solution to the water woes of the ayacutdars of the project, he contends.
