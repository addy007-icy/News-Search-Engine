The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) would soon make it a prerequisite for all new and already existing houses in the city to install solar units and avoid dependence on Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) for power requirement for different needs.Informing this, Mayor Byrappa said that the Corporation also plans to convert Mysuru as a ‘Green City’ by reducing emission of carbon dioxide to the minimum possible level in the coming days.He also said that the city would strive hard to retain its tag of being the cleanest city in the country.Inaugurating the 25 kW HT solar power generation unit at Sigma Hospital here on Monday, Mr. Byrappa said that the city Corporation is also planning to prevail upon the owners of big buildings to install rooftop solar power generation plants to help the State government tide over the power crisis.The Corporation wants to promote solar power generation in the city to help the Union government achieve its goal of generating over 20,000 MW of solar power by the year 2022 under the National Solar Mission, he added.MCC would soon hold talks with private hospitals, shopping malls, educational institutions and other establishments in the city and impress upon them to install rooftop solar power generation plants.Mr. Byrappa said that he would also discuss the issue with the MCC Councillors. He expressed confidence that all the Councillors would agree for the proposal.Many private hospitals, including one in Gokulam, have come forward to install such plants on the lines of Sigma Hospital.Speaking on the occasion, Umesh, Assistant Executive Engineer (Operations and Maintenance) said that CESC would ink an MoU with those who install solar power generation units assuring to buy power at a cost of Rs.9 and 56 paise per unit.Shamasunder Subbarao, NIE College professor, said that generating solar energy and supplying surplus power to the grid was first done 15 years ago in Germany and other European countries.“It is high time we help the government in tapping solar energy and to get over the (power) crisis. Mysuru has got the cleanest city tag because of its wide roads constructed by the erstwhile kings. Even if vehicles are parked on either side of most of the roads, it would not lead to traffic congestion,” he added. Gnanashankar, Managing Director of the hospital and Dr. Rajeshwari, Director of the hospital spoke on the occasion.
