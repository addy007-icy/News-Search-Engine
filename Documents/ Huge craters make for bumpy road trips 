The intersection of Velachery Main Road and Perumbakkam Main Road, Medavakkam, puts motorists at risk for accidents. The stretch is marked by huge craters, causing hardship to road users, especially motorcyclists and pedestrians. Frequent water-logging has severely damaged the stretch.Also, the road does not have any signal, leading to frequent accidents, especially at night. Motorists turning towards Sholinganallur from Pallikaranai and Medavakkam, face the risk of skidding. “We have to be careful while driving along these stretches as motorists can lose control while applying the brakes,” said K. Mani, an IT professional. Regular motorists taking the stretches say even their vehicles have been damaged as result of riding down these roads. “When a motorcycle hits a crater, the tyre can get punctured and the silencer can be damaged,” says G. Malathy, a motorist.“As the road is bumpy and full of potholes, traffic congestion is common here. A few vehicles come in the wrong direction to avoid the craters,” she added. As the stretch is used by heavy vehicles, motoring is anything but pleasant. Also, there pedestrian traffic here is significant.“To avoid traffic chaos due to absence of traffic signals at the intersection, vehicle users pass through Sowmiya Nagar to reach IT Corridor and the East Coast Road,” S. Raghunathan, a resident of Sowmiya Nagar, said. “Still, the intersection remains congested,” he added.“During rainy days, these roads become un-motorable. We had a tough time during the recent floods. Despite the poor road condition, a few motorists engage in reckless driving and neglect ane discipline,” R. Vignesh and S. Karthik, residents of Medavakkam, said.
