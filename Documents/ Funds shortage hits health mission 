With the National Health Mission funds not coming in, the Health Mission here is finding it tough to support the public health care institutions in the district.K.V. Thomas, MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, who chaired the first meeting of the Health Mission Vigilance Committee on Monday, said he would raise the issue in Parliament that the National Health Mission (NHM) had scaled down the fund flow for the State Mission.Earlier, the NHM used to provide about 75 per cent of the proposed fund but now only 60 per cent is available. The shortage is reflected in the untied funds that are made available for projects and the support the District Health Mission provides for the hospital development committees of the public health care institutions.Hospitals rely on the funds made available through the development societies for local purchases and immediate repairs.Yet another issue raised during the meeting was the human resources requirement at health care institutions.The District Health Mission can provide a maximum of 69 doctors in the urban and rural hospitals. The mission authorities requested that the status be maintained.In the current financial year, the NHM had provided Rs.11.78 crore for three major schemes and Rs.10.78 crore have been utilised till now. However, out of the Rs.107.27 crore provided for various other schemes, only 68 .5 per cent has been utilised.All popular schemes such as the Non-Communicable Diseases Programme, Mental Health Programme, Palliative Care and Janani Suraksha programmes are being implemented.MLAs Dominic Presentation, Ludy Luiz, Deputy Mayor T. J. Vinod, Additional District Medical Officer Dr. Jayashree, NHM district programme manager Dr. Haseena Mohammed, heads of various local self governments and officials participated.Funds crunch reflects in the support the mission provides for public health care.
