Delhi Police is investigating a case of forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy registered against four companies which had faced allegations of irregularities in connection with their donation to Aam Aadmi Party during the assembly election last year.A rebel group named AAP Volunteers Action Manch (AVAM) had last year alleged irregularities with respect to four companies which, they claimed, had donated around Rs 50 lakh each to Aam Aadmy Party (AAP) before the 2015 election, a police official said on Thursday.AVAM had also approached the Election Commission and Delhi Police but failed to substantiate their claim for which no case was registered then, the official said.But, later, an independent inquiry was taken up into the matter by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and it found that the several documents, including audit papers, pertaining to the accused companies were fake, he said.The offices of the said companies also did not exist at the mentioned addresses and the signature of a chartered accountant in the audit papers emerged to be forged, the official said.A regional director of the ministry lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police in November 2015 and investigation was taken up, following which a case under relevant IPC sections was registered, he said.“Investigation is underway and legal action will follow,” the official added.AAP has dismissed the allegation levelled by AVAM as baseless.
