As the Coimbatore Corporation enters election year 2016, it has got serious work to do to address the citizens’ needs and take the city to a level that it aspires to be.In the year that went by, the Corporation failed to complete the underground drainage scheme - something it should have done two years ago with the end of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission project.The civic body is yet to commission the Ondipudur sewage treatment plant, complete pipeline laying work and detangle the legal web that surrounds the Nanjundapuram sewage treatment plant. The year 2015 also saw the Coimbatore Corporation score poorly on the solid waste management front. The situation was so bad that the State Secretary, Municipal Administration and Water Supply, had to intervene to sort out the mess and re-start waste processing in Vellalore.Last year, Coimbatore Corporation came under attack from civic and consumer activists for setting up illegal bus shelters and trying to re-classify a reserve site in Vadavalli. In the year, the Corporation managed to continue its track record of failing to develop a scheme road.The Corporation had promised the residents that it would develop a scheme road every year.On the water supply front, the Corporation managed to score a few pluses as it completed the ‘distribution main’ pipeline laying work from the Ramakrishnapuram Tank to supply more water to Singanallur and other areas.It laid many a damaged road but the recent rains had undone the good work in several areas.As for the added area residents, the Corporation continued its past promises of soon installing street lights and providing underground and storm water drains.
