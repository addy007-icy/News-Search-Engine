George of Neendur near Kottayam. They said David was a sixth semester student of CET and left the class on Friday after attending the first hour.The other five occupants of the house, also civil engineering students but studying in different classes, had reached the house on Bhagat Singh Road near the campus, around 1 p.m., and found the body. They then alerted their faculty, who called in the police.The police said it was suspected to be a case of suicide, with both David’s father and his friends living with him stating that David was under medication for depression.
