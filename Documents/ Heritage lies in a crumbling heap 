The delay in repairing the damage on the wall of Vettimurichakotta, located on the south of the East Fort gate, has drawn flak.A portion of nearly 50 metres of the wall has remained in a damaged state for nearly a month.The sight of the collapsed wall was one that did not befit the legacy of the protected monument, which is often regarded as the pride of Thiruvananthapuram.The delay in repairing the damage has also inconvenienced pedestrians who are forced to walk on the busy road with the debris yet to be removed from the footpath.S. Hemachandran, former director of the State Archaeology Department, expressed concern at the lack of urgency shown by the department in repairing the wall.“It is a matter of great shame that conservation of heritage sites is not given the importance it deserves. There can been no justifiable excuse for the delay,” he said.According to him, several procedural formalities can be bypassed considering the seriousness of the particular issue.“The Director is vested with the authority of sanctioning immediate release of up to Rs.8 lakh for such works. A case can also be registered to investigate the cause of the wall collapse.”He added that much had changed for the worse since the conservation efforts undertaken in East Fort, which had won the coveted Gold Award of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) in 2004.Besides its poor upkeep, the Fort region has lost its charm owing to the encroachments on the footpaths.Asha Gopinath, a neuroscientist, who has been actively campaigning for the conservation of the region, said the dearth in awareness among the public regarding the heritage laws also contributed towards the scant regard of heritage monuments.She was of the view that the region that included the Fort and Chalai Bazaar came under a fragile heritage zone that deserved special focus.Dr. Gopinath also said that the wall of the Vettimurichakotta had collapsed due to the lack of drainage facilities that led to water-logging at the adjacent service centre of the KSRTC and not due to the recent heavy rains, as was being claimed by certain quarters.Dr. Gopinath also called for the implementation of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, which demarcated prohibited and regulated areas around monuments and archaeological sites.
