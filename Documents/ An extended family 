Every morning, Noodle, an eight-year-old male Labrador, scratches at the door of actor Anuja Iyer’s room at a house in Balaji Nagar, Royapettah, thinking that she is still asleep.Noodle does not give up till Lalitha, Anuja’s mother, comes and reminds Noodle that Anuja is living with her in-laws and that no one is there in the room.Noodle retires to his favourite spot, which incidentally is the veranda of a half-a-century-old-building. But, the next day, he repeats the ritual. Noodle and a few other pets, mostly dogs, share a special bond with Anuja. Despite her absence, Anuja ensures their well-being.“I am so attached to my pets that I regularly come to my house in Royapettah to meet them,” she says.Eight years ago, when Noodle was brought to her house by her brother, Sairam, after it was gifted by his friend, Anuja welcomed the new addition to their family with outstretched arms. But, her mother was not sure if it was the right decision as she had had never had pets.Together with her daughter, she learnt the art of taking care of pets. They then adopted more dogs. “In fact, I got to know my neighbours only while taking my dogs out for a walk,” says Anuja.The actor also has a three-year-old cat, Nila. Unlike Noodle and the other dogs, Nila is cautious about strangers. She hides safely behind the LPG cylinder in the kitchen. So shy is she that only when the dogs are tied does she venture out.“For those looking to have a pet animal, I suggest adopting a pet rather than buying one,” Anuja says.
