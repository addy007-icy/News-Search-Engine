Taking exception to what they termed as the failure of National Democratic Alliance Government at the Centre to bring down fuel prices in the country despite the drop in the prices of crude oil in the international market, members of Youth Congress staged a unique protest here on Monday.In a protest, led by president of the Dharwad Lok Sabha Constituency Youth Congress unit Nagaraj Gouri, the Youth Congress members gave away one litre petrol free to those who bought one litre packaged drinking water priced at Rs. 20.Naturally, the protest at Durgad Bail Circle caught the attention of passersby and within minutes, packaged water was sold out as motorists bought water for getting free petrol.Addressing the protesters, Mr. Nagaraj Gouri criticised the Union government for what he said its failure to cut down fuel prices. He said that crude oil prices were even less than that of packaged water bottles. However, the Union government had not reduced fuel prices, he said.Mr. Nagaraj Gouri said that petrol was sold for Rs. 74.65 per litre in the country in 2013 when crude oil price per barrel was $ 107. “But now when crude oil price has come down to $ 36 per barrel, the oil companies are selling petrol at Rs. 62.90 per litre,” he said.The Youth Congress members then burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to register their protest.
