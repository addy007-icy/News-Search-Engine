The Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation Limited will honour a woman entrepreneur from Balaramapuram for reaping profits with the ‘Kepco integration scheme.’M.S. Beena, a resident of Uchakkada near Balaramapuram, had received 7,938 chicks for rearing as part of the scheme launched by Kepco in 2006 to encourage poultry farming. Without any investment, she earned Rs.1.62 lakh by rearing the chicks for 45 days.Under the scheme, self help groups, farmers and individuals procure day-old chicks for free and rear them under the supervision of veterinarians. Kepco also provides free medicine and feed. When the birds attain 45 days they will be procured by Kepco by paying the farmer Rs.10 per kg.“Her only expense was for labour charge. And that she could easily gain by selling chicken manure, which is in good demand from farmers,” according to V. Sunil Kumar, Managing Director, Kepco.A function will be held at Uchakkada on Tuesday to honour her. Minister for Agriculture K.P. Mohanan will honour her along with other successful entrepreneurs.
