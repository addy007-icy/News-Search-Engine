Islamic State (IS) has built a research centre devoted to launching attacks in the West, using driverless cars and rehabilitated anti-aircraft missiles, new footage from inside the terror group reveals.The centre is in the group’s Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, where technicians from around the world have been plotting to wreak chaos.The footage, obtained by Sky News, sheds light on a research and development arm of the organisation that has long been the subject of speculation, but has not previously been confirmed. It also confirms accounts from IS members, as well as the fears of European intelligence agencies, that IS is working to step up attacks in Europe.Among the new revelations, which IS did not intend, are efforts to make defunct surface-to-air missiles operational again by replacing thermal batteries — a feat that has so far been beyond the capabilities of other terror groups. The footage does not establish that such a goal has been achieved, but it does show the technological ambitions of a group that has carved out its influence through more familiar forms of terror, such as car bombs and suicide belts.Surface-to-air missiles falling into the hands of IS, or any terror group, is considered near the top of worst-case scenarios for Western and regional officials.Among the eight hours of video, which was seized by the Free Syrian Army and passed on to Sky News, is a segment showing IS members trying to manoeuvre a driverless car. They are also shown busily strapping tape and padding to a mannequin, in the hope it will give off the same heat signature as a human when it passes by imaging scanners, which are often used near sensitive buildings.IS appears more intent than ever on exporting chaos to cities such as Rome, Paris, Brussels and London. In particular, intelligence agencies fear IS has managed to smuggle a small number of members into Europe. They are intended to act as sleeper cells that can train local recruits in how to carry out the attacks.Over the past year, The Guardian has learned that technicians and scientists from European states have become essential members of the group’s operations, in particular a chemical weapons division, which manufactures poisons and gases and also attempts to weaponise chemicals seized from the Syrian regime, or sold on by corrupt officials. — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016
