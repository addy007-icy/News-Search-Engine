Revenue employees abstain from workDemanding early implementation of their charter of demands, revenue staff at the Collectorate went on a mass casual leave on Thursday. According to their association office-bearers, 576 employees abstained from work. Though the Revenue Minister assured them at an earlier meeting to vacancies would be filled and promotions effected, they had remained in cold storage. As a result, the public, who had come to the office for getting their works done in the forenoon, left the place after getting to know about the stir.
