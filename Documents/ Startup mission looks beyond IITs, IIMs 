The Start-Up India mission to be unveiled on Saturday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi includes an ambitious plan to create a network of startup centres, technology business incubators and research parks, to take the startup culture beyond the top-tier education institutions such as IITs and IIMs.The Human Resource Development Ministry and the Department of Science and Technology have agreed to partner in an initiative to set up over 75 such startup support hubs in the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) and NIPERs or National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research.“From about 70 incubators set up by the government between 2001 and 2014, we have now crossed 100 incubators. About 90 of these are in educational institutions, with virtually all the old IITs and IIMs covered,” said Harkesh Mittal, adviser and head of the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board.“The number of IIT/IIM graduates looking to start their own ventures has gone from two per cent a few years ago to nearly 10 per cent now, but we need to take this movement to our other educational institutions as well,” Mr. Mittal told The Hindu .
