: The State Bank of Travancore on Saturday launched an electronic Fund Management System for direct and faster release of wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGA). The scheme is being implemented in the country for the first time and Kerala has been chosen for the pilot project, a press note issued here said.The National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) will enable direct and immediate credit of wages into the accounts of 21 lakh beneficiaries (90 per cent of whom are women) of MNREGA in all districts of Kerala. Of the above, about 50 per cent of the beneficiaries maintain accounts with SBT.Launching the scheme at the SBT head office, K.V. Mohan Kumar, Commissioner for Rural Development, said the pilot project would avoid delays in the credit of wages to beneficiaries of the MNREGA scheme. He also said that the number of beneficiaries in Kerala was higher compared to other States. It is estimated that there are 20 lakh beneficiaries, mainly women, in the State. “Recently, a team from Punjab had come here to study how the scheme was being implemented as the numbers were much lower there,” Mr. Mohan Kumar said. The total wage component of the MNREGA payout is about Rs. 2,300 crore in Kerala, the press note said.SBT Managing Director, Jeevandas Narayan said the bank was the sole sponsor bank for MNREGA in the State and the average payments processed by SBT averaged 3 lakh per day. Mr. Narayan said SBT was the only bank with a dedicated Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) branch which has been handling payment of oil and gas subsidies, social security pensions, scholarships and also payments under Indira Avas Yojana. From now, the DBT branch will handle the transactions of MNREGA through the NeFMS platform.
