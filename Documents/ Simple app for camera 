Base is a replacement camera app that wants to give your photographs a new foundation. If you’ve wanted to spruce up your photos before going into a photo editing app, then Base should help you out.The interface of Base is fairly simple and straightforward, making it a breeze to use. In fact, it’s pretty similar to the main Camera app, so it also feels natural but with bonus features. The viewfinder takes up most of the screen, and there are toggles in the top left and right corner for the flash and switching between the front and rear-facing cameras. You can also tap to focus, though there are no separate focus and exposure controls, unfortunately. To capture the image, just tap on the large shutter button centred at the bottom.But there is more to Base than that. While the main interface is familiar, the app adds some nice extras that make it stand out among other camera replacements. There are 15 dots (the kind that indicate pages on your iPhone home screen) underneath the viewfinder that represent the film filter that you can use while shooting.Sliding your finger along the dots allows you choose which one to use, with the no film option directly in the centre.Each filter represents an old-school film that you would have used back in the day, and they are all subtle and tasteful.Another unique feature of Base is the fact that the 14 filters also have an ‘expired’ version, where they shift colours and change appearance the longer you use the app. To toggle the expired versions of the films, all you have to do is tap on the button in the bottom right corner.There isn’t going to be much difference if you just started out with the app, but it becomes noticeable over time.
