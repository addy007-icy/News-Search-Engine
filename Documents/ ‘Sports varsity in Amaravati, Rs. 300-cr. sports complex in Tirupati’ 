Sports infrastructure is all set to get a boost in the State in the form of a Sports University in Amaravati and a sports complex of international repute in Tirupati.According to Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) Chairman P.R. Mohan, the government is paying renewed attention to improve sports infrastructure in the State.He pointed to the allotment of 1200 acres of land for developing world class sports infrastructure in the new capital city of Amaravati. “Andhra Pradesh will the first State in the country to have an all-encompassing Sports University,” he said.This apart, a sports complex is coming up at a cost of Rs.300 crore in Tirupati. It may be recalled here that the foundation stone was laid for construction of an international stadium in Tirupati much before the bifurcation, when N. Kirankumar Reddy was the Chief Minister.The project was, however, stalled by an order from the National Green Tribunal, as the proposed site was abutting the Tirumala hills and would lead to felling of trees.AP will the first State in India to have anall-encompassing Sports University: SAAP Chiarman
