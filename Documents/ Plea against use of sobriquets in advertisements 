The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday transferred to its Principal Seat in Chennai a public interest litigation petition filed by a lawyer against the use of sobriquets such as ‘Amma’ and ‘Puratchi Thalaivi’ to refer to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in government advertisements.A Division Bench of Justices V. Ramasubramanian and N. Kirubakaran passed the order at the request of the petitioner, P. Rathinam (69), also a social activist, since the First Division Bench led by Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had on September 4 dismissed a similar PIL petition filed by him. The petitioner said his earlier case got dismissed since he could not bring to the notice of the court a 1995 judgement of the Supreme Court which held that even recipients of national awards such as Bharat Ratna and Padma Shri could not use them as titles or prefixes.Referring to Article 18(1) of the Constitution which declares abolition of titles, a five-judge Bench of the apex court, led by the then Chief Justice of India A.M. Ahmadi, had said: “It is clear that in enacting Article 18(1), the framers of the Constitution sought to put an end to the practice followed by the British.“However, the framers did not intend that the State should not officially recognise merit or work of an extraordinary nature… It is, therefore, necessary that there should be a system of awards and decorations to recognise excellence in the performance of these duties.“The National Awards do not amount to ‘titles’ within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should not be used as suffixes or prefixes. If this is done, the defaulter should forfeit the award by following the procedure laid down in Regulation 10 of each of the four notifications creating these National Awards.”Public moneyWhen such were stringent restrictions imposed on recipients of national awards, how could public money be spent on issuing advertisements with sobriquets and laudatory references, which did not serve any public purpose, Mr. Rathinam asked.Quotes Supreme Court judgement to buttress his case
