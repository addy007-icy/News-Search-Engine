Ridden with potholes, Market Road near the Villivakkam railway station is giving traders and residents a tough time. The road runs parallel to the Villivakkam railway station and has hundreds of people visiting it due to the presence of the wholesale market, one of the oldest in north Chennai.The condition of Market Road detracts from the charm of shopping at this wholesale market, say shoppers.“This is a link road that connects Kamaraj Street in Rajaji Nagar and Kolathur Main Road near the railway gate and both traders and shoppers use the stretch,” says S. Venugopal, a resident of Villivakkam, who shops regularly at the market.Many residents say they don’t remember when the road was last re-laid.“We have many traders coming from Kadamatur, Tirutani, Tiruvallur and Arakkonam and a majority of them bring their produce in mini-vans. The road is full of craters. We have made many representations to the local authorities to re-lay the road,” said T. Srinivasan, manager, Villivakkam market.The Welfare Association Rajaji Nagar has also made many representations to improve the area outside the station. Some years ago, residents had pooled in money to fill up the vacant area near the station as people could not even walk there.“Water stagnates even after light showers, making the stretch slippery,” says A.V. Surendiran, chairman of the Association.Corporation officials of ward 65 say the road belongs to Railway’s and they need to relay it.
