Arguing that an important and Constitutional post like the Mayor of a city cannot remain vacant for long, a Congress delegate, led by Cuttack city chief Md Moqim, submitted a memorandum to State Election Commissioner (SEC) R. M. Senapati at Bhubaneswar on Saturday urging the latter to initiate immediate steps to elect the new mayor.Anita Behera of the BJD had put in her papers on December 29 last after it was established that she had obtained a ration card in her name to receive five kilos of subsidised rice and wheat every month under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).Ms Behera, who had forwarded her resignation letter to deputy mayor Ajay Barik, had also resigned from the post of corporator of for which she was elected from Ward-21 of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) in February 2014.“Her resignation letter will be tabled in the CMC council meeting on January 4 for appropriate action,” said Mr. Barik.On the other hand, a shadow war has emerged between three city BJD MLAs — Debashis Samantray of Cuttack-Barabati, Pravat Biswal of Cuttack-Choudwar and Chandrasarathi Behera of Cuttack Sadar -- each apparently trying to get one of their own supporters to occupy the coveted mayoral post.The post is reserved for a scheduled caste (SC) woman and there are now three SC women corporators among the remaining 58-member council. Two of these women corporators come under the Cuttack-Choudwar segment, while the other belongs to Cuttack Sadar. Thus the legislators of these two segments want the mayoral elections to be held immediately. But Cuttack city legislator, under whose segment comes the ward vacated by Anita Behera, wants the mayoral election to he held after the by-election in Ward-21so that the new corporator could stake her claim to the post.Seeing this internal bickering among the ruling party legislators, the Congress — which has just nine seats in the 59-member council -- wants to drive a wedge between them by demanding immediate elections. “The mayor’s post of the city cannot remain vacant for long, lest the civic problems in the city should mount,” Mr. Moqim said.
