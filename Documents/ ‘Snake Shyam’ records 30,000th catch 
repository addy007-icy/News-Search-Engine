The city’s own amateur conservationist, who is also a local councillor, reached a milestone on Wednesday.M.S. Balasubramaniam — popularly known as ‘Snake Shyam’ — recorded his 30,000th catch since he started keeping a count of the number of snakes caught and rescued by him since 1997.Ask for Balasubramaniam and the name does not strike a resonance among the people of Mysuru. But ‘Snake Shyam’ is instantly recognised as the friendly and affable snake catcher, who rushes to remove the slithery reptile from one’s backyard. Besides, he was featured in the National Geographic channel, which made a special documentary on this naturalist on wheels a few years ago. ‘Snake Shyam’ also doubles up as an auto driver to transport children to school.On reaching the milestone, he shrugged it off as just another day and before the significance of the count could sink in, he received a few more calls — of snakes creeping into some houses — and had to rescue them, thus increasing his tally by evening.Piece of adviceAn intriguing person complete with colourful attire besides rings and charms adorning all his fingers, ‘Snake Shyam’ advises the public not to disturb the creature and leave it alone till he attends to it. “With the onset of warmer days, expect the number of snakes looking for cooler places and consequently an increase in complaints of snakes entering houses,” he explains.But given his tight schedule, for he doubles up as an auto driver and has the additional responsibility as a councillor of ward number 17, ‘Snake Shyam’ has established a team who attend to calls in his absence.Though there is nothing “official” about his count on the number of snakes caught by him, it could have been double or perhaps more as he ventured into the field in 1980 but did not keep an account for almost 17 years.“By and large, snakes are harmless and do not bite unless disturbed,” he says, though people remain unconvinced given the general aversion and fear of snakes.“They have a special role in the nature’s scheme of things and in maintaining ecological balance, as snakes prey on rats which multiply rapidly and destroy our foodgrain,” he said. ‘Snake Shyam’ may be contacted on 9448069399.
