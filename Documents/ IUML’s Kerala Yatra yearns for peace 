Extending its unflinching support to the UDF to ensure continued governance, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML)â€™s Kerala Yatra was flagged off from Hosangadi, near Manjeswaram, on Sunday. The march, led by party State treasurer and Industries Minister P.K. Kunhalikutty, raises the slogan of brotherhood, equality, and harmony.The yatra was flagged off by party State president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal. In his inaugural address, Mr. Hyderali Thangal stressed the need to foster strong unity in the ruling UDF to retain power. He said that literary figures and lovers of peace along with people from minority communities were facing threat from attacks unleashed by fascist forces. Stating that terror strikes unleashed by outfits such as the Islamic State (IS) were paving the way for tarnishing the image of the Muslim community, he said that Kerala was witnessing political violence at the initiative of both the CPI(M) and the RSS even as the people longed for a peaceful life.It was the bounden duty of all organisations reposing faith in secularism to put stiff resistance to the unhealthy tendencies.Maintaining that efforts were under way to polarise society on communal lines, Mr. Shihab Thangal said that the nefarious designs of vested groups were getting encouraged with fascist forces managing to rule the country. The march, which will traverse through major strongholds of the party, would culminate in Thiruvananthapuram on February 11.
