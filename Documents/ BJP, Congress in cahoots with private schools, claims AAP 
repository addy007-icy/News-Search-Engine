Reacting to the Opposition’s criticism against scrapping of management quota in school admission, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government on Friday alleged that the BJP and Congress leaders have a “nexus” with managements of private schools in Delhi. AAP warned that the Delhi government will reveal names “complicit” in this act if the two parties don’t do so voluntarily.The party said only such involvement can explain the opposition to the decision of scrapping of management and all other quotas in private schools. “Why are they opposing? Is it because the vested interests have been challenged? What else explains their compulsions to oppose, especially when people are happy?” AAP’s Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey asked.Mr. Pandey alleged that BJP leaders are “running schools” and that the government will reveal those names. “The intention is clear, the beneficiaries of the management quota admission syndicate does not want poor and deserving students to get admission in the best schools. Some people have also taken the benami route," he alleged.AAP has posed three questions to the Congress and the BJP: “whom are they trying to protect by opposing the abolishing of management quota? Are the parties under the grip of the education mafia? Why is that every time the government brings in a pro-people policy, the two parties oppose it under any pretext?”Reacting to the accusations, Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay said the government should have “spoken to the stakeholders” before making the declaration.Congress spokesperson Sharmistha Mukherjee said the changes should have been incorporated in the recently passed Education Bills. “Why are they acting like an NGO and why are they asking questions if they have any such evidence?” she asked.
