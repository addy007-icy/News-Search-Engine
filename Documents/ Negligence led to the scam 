The negligence on the part of both the officials of the Agriculture Department and bankers is clearly visible in the Rs.3.2 crore scam that hit the department. It was stated that the amount withdrawn from 21 cheques of both State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank (APGVB) was reportedly diverted to 67 bank accounts across the nation. The investigating officers suspect that it is not the handy work of just one individual. On Jan. 11, one of the officials from the SBH, Sangareddy, reportedly sent a communication to the Agriculture Department informing that a huge amount to the tune of Rs. 1.36 crore was being transacted, and to check whether the list of beneficiaries is right. “Without checking it properly or keeping a copy of it for office records, an officer of the department routinely signed and forwarded it to the bank,” said an investigating officer.Had they been alert, the scam amount might have been reduced to some extent, he added. On the other hand, both the banks – SBH and APGVB- had reportedly honoured cheques issued in the name of individuals. Meanwhile, Investigating Officer and Deputy Superintendent of Police M. Tirupatanna along with Town Circle Inspector Anjaneyulu and Sub-Inspector (Rural) Shivalingam visited the JD office and questioned the officials.
