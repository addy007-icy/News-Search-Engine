The civil society here on Wednesday gave a free hand to the district administration to take extreme measures to make kite flying safe and harmless in the city.Kite flying will now be restricted to only in open spaces, riverbeds and islets, having no roads passing nearby. School and college teachers have been asked to sensitise the students about not to fly kites on rooftops or on roads in busy localities and marketplaces.“We have decided to come down heavily on the trade and use of plastic manja and a special squad would be formed soon to confiscate the killer string after sensitising the people about it,” said District Collector N. C. Mishra after presiding over a deliberation in which people from all walks of life participated.This move came three days after the death of a six-year-old girl, whose throat was slit by plastic manja while she was riding a motorcycle with her father on the outskirts of the city on Sunday.The city has also witnessed several similar mishaps earlier. Expressing deep anguish over the incidents, speakers in the meeting condemned the use of unsafe materials while observing the traditions. The participants also pledged donations to the family of the child and sources said an amount of Rs.25,000 was collected on the spot. Earlier in the day, a group of school students took out a rally in the city and marched towards the Purighat police station shouting slogans and holding banners in protest against kite flying.
