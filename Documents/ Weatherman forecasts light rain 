Chasing the sun to dry damp laundry, celebrating a sunny day and dealing with an overcast sky are things that Delhi expects in January.While some Delhiites are happy that the weather has been relatively mild so far, those waiting for the cold may finally get to experience it.The Meteorological Department has forecast partly cloudy skies over the city with a possibility of light rain in the evening/late night over southern parts of the Capital.Moderate to dense fog is likely to engulf the city on January 20 and 21.The capital also recorded the coldest night of the season with the minimum temperature plunging to 6 degrees Celsius from 9.6 degrees Celsius.The change in weather is due to a western disturbance that brought down temperatures in northern India.However, this is not likely to be strong enough to cause any significance change in the Capital, says the weatherman.Temperatures on January 19 are likely to settle between 18 degrees Celsius and 8 degrees Celsius.
