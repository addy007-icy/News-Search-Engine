Girijans should struggle unitedly to make the government withdraw GO No. 97 to stop its plans to take up bauxite mining in the Agency area, former MP and general secretary of the Girijana Sangham Midiam Baburao said.Bauxite mining would help the Anrak company to amass huge profits and there was no benefit to the Girijans and Nalco’s project in Damanjodi in Odisha proved that there was no truth in government’s claim that Girijans would get jobs in the project in Visakha Agency, Dr. Babu Rao said while releasing a book, ‘Juwar Nestam’ on Sunday.The government was using force, threw to winds the Constitution and even ignored the recommendations made by the Kala Committee, formed by it to support its stand, to convene Grama Sabhas and take opinions from expert committee that should include Girijans, he said.The government was hell-bent on taking up bauxite mining to hand over the natural resource to the corporate sector and is creating terror among Girijans by foisting false cases on them in connection with the killing of Jerrela ex-sarpanch by the Maoists, Dr. Babu Rao said. The anti-bauxite mining JAC would fight the issue shoulder-to-shoulder with the Girijans, its convenor O. Ramamurthy said. Scrapping of GO No. 97 was necessary on the part of government to assure Girijans that their lives, habitat and culture are protected, Mr. Ramamurthy said.
