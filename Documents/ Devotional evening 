Amritavarshini a cultural body founded a few years ago by Addepalli Sambasiva Rao, staged a devotional program marking the dawn of the New Year at Gokaraju Laila Gangaraju Kala Vedika. The day long program included Maha Santi Yagam in the morning and cultural programmes in the evening. The evening session included Annamacharya kirtana ganam by mellow voiced singer Malladi Swathi and her son, a hilarious playlet written by Jandhyala and directed by Bramhananda Rao and finally a brief but attractive Kuchipudi dance drama `Srinivasa Kalyanam’ by disciples of well-known Kuchipudi exponent Ghantasala Pavan Kumar.Nearly 15 specially selected Annamacharya compositions were rendered by Malladi Swati with the support of her young son. Some of the highlights were ‘ Emamma Emamma’, ‘ Adaro Padaro’, ‘ Muddugare Yasoda’, ‘ Govinda Govinda yani’, ‘ Pidikiti Talambralu’, ‘ Jagadapu talapula’, ‘ Adivo Alladivo’ and ‘ Chakkani Talliki Changu Bhala’.The sankirtana ganam was inaugurated by prominent lawer and patron of arts Vemula Hazarattaiah Gupta. Fine keyboard support for Swathi was given by veteran Veerabhadra Rao. The last cultural program was a brief but spectacular dance drama ‘Srinivasa Kalyanam’ by the talented disciples of Kuchipudi natyacharya Ghantasala Pavankumar.
