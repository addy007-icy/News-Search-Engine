Tirupati Urban Superintendent of Police Gopinath Jatty on Sunday said that strict vigil was being maintained on the red sanders smugglers and some of the accused who were recently released on bail after being booked under the Preventive Detention (PD) Act. Speaking to The Hindu , the SP said several armed police parties had been regularly combing the vulnerable stretches in Seshachalam hills during the last one week in view of heavy influx of woodcutters from Tamil Nadu. The official said that in addition to the seizure of red sanders logs at Tirumala foothills on Sunday morning, over four tonnes of logs and several vehicles were seized since a week. Mr. Jatty said that surveillance would be further intensified in the direction of achieving complete domination over red sanders smuggling activity in the region.
