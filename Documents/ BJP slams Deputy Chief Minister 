The BJP on Tuesday slammed Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s move to challenge the Central government’s order declaring the state government’s suspension of two special secretaries as null and void.Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta said that it is unconstitutional on the part of Mr Sisodia to challenge the orders of the Union Home Ministry.“It cannot be overlooked that the CCS Conduct Rule, 1964 under which the Deputy Chief Minister has tried to defend the action of Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain is not applicable to IAS as well as DANICS and other allied service officers. As per constitutional provisions, appointing and disciplinary authority of such officials is under central government,” he said.
