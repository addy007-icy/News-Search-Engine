The Telangana Telugu Desam Party is actively contemplating to rope in film star and Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan to campaign for the TDP-BJP combine in the forthcoming elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.TTDP president L. Ramana and other senior leaders, who met here on Tuesday, are said to have discussed about the issue as it could help on consolidating the votes of residents hailing from Andhra Pradesh in favour of the alliance. A final decision on the issue would be taken after obtaining details about Mr. Pawan’s shooting schedule.The party, however, had decided to organise a meeting of the party functionaries of the twin cities on Jan 9. The meeting, to be addressed by the party president N. Chandrababu Naidu, would mark the commencement of the party’s campaign in the GHMC jurisdiction.
