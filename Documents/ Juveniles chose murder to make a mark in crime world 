Three minors, who stabbed a man to death on December 10, were nabbed by the Chandra Layout police on Tuesday.The boys, all school dropouts under the age of 16, wanted to become rowdies, said the police. They though that killing a man could make them infamous and they could create a fear psychosis among residents to extort money, a senior police officer said. The trio confronted the victim, 40-year-old bicycle mechanic Shivamadhu, while he was returning home from a party in the wee hours of December 10 and stabbed him.The boys were caught based on the physical description provided by two of Shivamdu's assistants who had witnessed the murder. The accused were placed in a government home for boys and the case has been handed over to the Child Welfare Committee.“The suspects were habitual offenders who were involved in petty theft and robberies. Recently, they devised a plan to make a mark in the crime world so that they can extort money from the public using their criminal background. Hence they decided to kill someone and become rowdies,” a senior police officer said.Explaining the reason that pushes children into the world of crime, B.R. Madhukar, consultant psychiatrist at St. Martha’s Hospital, said many of the perpetrators come from backgrounds where criminal behaviour is present. The influence of films is also not ruled out. “This is a very vulnerable age group, which looks up to movies as a way of life. They are influenced by hero worship or glorification of crime,” he added.The boys, all school dropouts under the age of 16, wanted to become rowdies, say the police
