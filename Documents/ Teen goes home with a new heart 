“The sky is smaller than the happiness I feel in my heart today,” said Anthony D’Souza, father of 16-year-old Sweden who was discharged from hospital on Tuesday after a heart transplant on January 3.While an elated Mr. D’Souza thanked the family of the Indore girl once again for donating their daughter’s heart, Sweden’s doctors said they were working on increasing awareness, even among physicians, to get more children with heart conditions listed for transplants.“Sweden has recovered very well and is going home in two weeks. However, we will have to keep an eye on her progress. A team member has visited her place to check hygiene since she is on drugs that prevent heart rejection but at the same time make her prone to infections,” said Dr. Vijay Agarwal, head of paediatric cardiac surgery at Fortis hospital.Her doctors will keep a close eye on the progress. Given her vulnerability to infections, she has also been advised to not resume college for at least six months, Dr. Agarwal added.On the advice of doctors, the D’Souzas have created a special room to protect Sweden from dust and infections.“It’s a glass cabin with an air-conditioner. Everything in the room is new,” said Mr. D’Souza, who works as a watchman. He also expressed gratitude to the business family that took care of Sweden’s medical expenses.Dr. Agarwal said while the six heart transplants had been carried out in Fortis, there was much more to be done in terms of spreading awareness.
