Hunting for a scenic backdrop to take that perfect selfie can often be futile in the heart of a dusty, crowded city.But two such selfie-spots are now available at the Ernakulathappan Ground where the 34th edition of the Cochin Flower Show organised by the Ernakulam District Agri-Horticultural Society is underway. Two garden benches surrounded by lilium, marigold, pentas and dahlias in the middle of a beautiful floral display spread over 20,000 sq.ft. have now become the favourite hotspot of selfie-hunters.One of the highlights of the show is the music-themed floral arrangement in an area spread over 5,000 sq.ft. by local florists using imported flowers, including ornamental cabbage and spider chrysanthemum from Australia. The show will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. till Sunday. Entry ticket is charged at Rs. 50 for adults and Rs. 20 for children.
