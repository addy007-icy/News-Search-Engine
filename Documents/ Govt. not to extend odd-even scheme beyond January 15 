Amid reports that the odd-even scheme may be extended, Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai on Saturday asserted that the government has no intention to take the road rationing experiment beyond January 15.The pilot plan for cutting vehicular emission was launched on January 1.“Government is neither going to extend odd-even scheme beyond January 15 nor finish it before the 15-day trial period,” Mr. Rai said, terming some of media reports of extending the scheme as “false”.He said the traffic restriction is just only for 15 days and after the trial period, government will study the data collected through it and will do a proper analysis, adding, it will then be able to take a final decision.Mr. Rai said from January 1-8, traffic police, transport and revenue departments have issued 5,893 challans for the violation of the odd-even rules so far.The government has also received 13,528 calls on its two helplines in the last one week and most of them were related to queries about the scheme. Out of these calls, 395 were related to complaints against bus, auto drivers, and other issues.According to the minister, in view of traffic rush on some road stretches during peak hours, government has decided to deploy additional teams of transport department and traffic police to manage traffic there from Monday. The areas include, ITO, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Connaught Place, Mathura Road, Ashram, New Friends Colony, Nehru Place, Sarai Kale Khan, Hanuman Mandir Marg and Dhaula Kuan.
