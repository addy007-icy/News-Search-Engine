Roads of the city these days wear a different look altogether. In most parts, they look more like a wide canvas on which an abstract artwork has been attempted. And drivers, who all these years suffered from potholes, are now made to suffer erratically layered road stretches that come dotted with uneven and bumpy surfaces at several places.In the run up to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls, the civic body has announced recarpeting of the bitumen roads running to a length of around 1,800 km by spending Rs.337 crore. In apparent absence of a properly designed strategy, the recarpeting is taken up in haphazard manner with just filling of bitumen to cover potholes and cracks on the roads.Senior officials of the Engineering Wings, when quizzed, admit that no thorough stock taking or inspection was carried out for the exercise that has lead to patchy surfaces appearing across the city. One of the officials did admit of lack of supervision too for the works being carried out.In some places like the stretch below the flyover at Greenlands, the recarpeting has ended up creating road surfaces that are neither even nor come with properly tapered edges. Shankar Reddy, a businessman from Krishnanagar colony said despite moving at a slow pace, his two-wheeler skid near the Satya Sai Nigamagam stretch because of the uneven surface. “The bike could not negotiate the level of recarpeting and skid. I have hurt my knee ,” he lamented.Citizens, who were given assurances about smooth surfaced white toppedroads, a pilot of which was done at Road No.10 Banjara Hills, now do not even have a properly and completely recarpeted road stretches with patches of various sizes and shapes dotting all over.
