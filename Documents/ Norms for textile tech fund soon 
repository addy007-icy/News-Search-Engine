The Union Textile Ministry will issue guidelines for the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) in a couple of weeks, Textile Commissioner Kavita Gupta said. The spinning and ginning segments have not been covered under the revised scheme, which gives thrust to the garment and technical textiles segments. The notification had been issued and the guidelines would be given soon, she said on Friday.Union Minister of State for Textiles Santosh Kumar Gangwar said the ministry had given approval for 22 parks under the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks. By 2020, these parks would get investments to the tune of Rs.30,000 crore.With this, the total number of parks under the scheme would be 72. Six projects had been approved under the Integrated Processing Development Scheme. This includes one project in Tamil Nadu. The government is taking steps to boost the textile sector.
