With growing awareness about harmful effects of pesticides in vegetables and poultry products, the demand for organic products has grown several times over in Gurgaon over the past few years.Gagan Deep Singh, who runs an organic food store named “Live Organic” in Gurgaon, told The Hindu that the market for organic products in the Millennium City has increased substantially.“My wife and I left our corporate jobs to start an organic products store in 2010. In less than five years, our turnover has increased from Rs.10 lakh to Rs.3.2 crore annually. Though we supply products in Delhi and Noida, almost 85 per cent of our demand comes from Gurgaon itself,” said Mr. Singh, who holds a Masters’ Degree in Business Management.His wife Harpeet added that they had started with supplying milk five years ago and now their portfolio comprises almost all kinds of organic products.“Growing awareness and high income are two major factors contributing to the growing market in Gurgaon. At the national level, the organic product market is worth over Rs.300 crore and growing at the rate of over 40 per cent to 50 per cent annually,” she added.Most organic vegetables sold at such stores in Gurgaon are supplied by farmers in Sonipat.“We are a group of over 300 farmers in Sonipat growing and supplying organic vegetables. We quit conventional farming to adopt organic farming 10 years ago and have even formed a Kisan Welfare Club. The vegetables grown by us are certified,” said Kishore Dahiya, who heads the club.“The government should compensate farmers for the loss of income in the early years during the switchover from conventional to organic farming. Also, there is no provision for training of such farmers. The government should also set up some certification agency to certify organic products at reasonable fee,” he added.With help from Sushant Lok Residents’ Welfare Association, the farmers have also started selling their organic products at a weekly market, where consumers buy directly from farmers. Besides Sonipat, farmers from nearby areas like Sohna, Damdama and Faridabad too sell their produce in this market.The farmers are allowed to charge customers 20 per cent higher than what they charge a middleman.“If a farmer sells the produce at Rs.100 per kg to a middleman, we allow him to sell it for Rs.120 per kg to the customer, who normally gets it at mark up of 50 per cent to 60 per cent,” said an RWA member.Most organic vegetables soldin Gurgaon stores are supplied by farmers in Sonipat
