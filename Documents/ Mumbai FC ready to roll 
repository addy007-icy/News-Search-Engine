Mumbai FC has spared no efforts in hand-picking some top quality Indian and foreign players, while also successfully retaining the services of several key figures from last season. The result is a solid and stable outfit for the 2015-16 I-League campaign.At a press conference here, where the team officially launched its home and away kits, sponsored by PLAYWIN, head coach and Mumbai’s longest-serving manager since 2009 Khalid Jamil said, “The team is doing well and have trained hard for this gruelling journey. All the players are fully fit and ready to take on any opposition.“We recently won the Nadkarni Cup, which gave us a big boost. We have been doing fairly well in the MDFA Elite Division as well,” he said.The club has managed to hold on to midfielder Taisuke Matsugae for another season. The 33-year-old will shoulder additional responsibility this term as Jamil has put his full faith in the Japanese by appointing him club captain.There was much interest in how Jamil would accommodate star signing Arata Izumi into his set-up. He said, “After watching him at Mahindra United and Pune FC, I realised how versatile he is. He could play in any position in midfield — left, right or centre. Not many players have that sort of versatility. He is massively experienced and arrives here with good ISL form. So, I cannot make him play in one position...will have to shuffle him around depending on my formation.”The Mumbaikers begin their campaign away at Guwahati against Shillong Lajong on Jan. 10. Local fans will get their first taste of action at the refurbished Cooperage against East Bengal on Jan.17, in the first of three back-to-back home games (versus Salgaocar on Jan 24 and Bengaluru FC on Jan 27).
