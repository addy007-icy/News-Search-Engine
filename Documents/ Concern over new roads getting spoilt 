Members of the city corporation expressed concern over newly-laid roads getting spoilt due to the laying of pipelines for the 24x7 drinking water schemes.B. Kumaraswamy of Congress, who broached the issue at the general body meeting held here on Wednesday, drew the attention of Mayor Nagamma that roads had been laid in most of the localities spending whopping funds and the same roads were getting spoilt with the improper laying of drinking water pipelines.“My heart bleeds on seeing the roads getting spoilt. Even the refilling work is not being done properly and scientifically. To lay the pipes, the roads are being dug at many places, instead of laying the pipes on either side of the road. Such acts would further bring down the life of the considerably. I am at a loss to understand why the officials of Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation or our own engineering staff are not supervising the work. Either direct the officials to ensure that the pipelines are laid properly without causing damage to the roads or instruct them to stop the work immediately,” he said.The Executive Engineer of KUIDC invited the wrath of the members by saying that the contractor was not listening to him as he was out of his control. “As an official if you are unable to get the work done properly why should you continue in the post,” members sought to know.The body moved on to next subject when Municipal Commissioner Ramesh gave strict instructions to the executive engineer to either ensure that the pipelines are laid scientifically and refill it properly or ask the contractor to stop the work
