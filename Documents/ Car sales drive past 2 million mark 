India’s car sales crossed the two-million-mark in 2015 helped by lower fuel prices and new models , according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).Sales during January-December stood at a record 20,34,015 units, a growth of almost 10 per cent year-on-year. The previous highest-ever domestic sales of 19,98,703 units was registered in 2012“The growth in the car segment was helped by uptick in economic activity, new vehicle launches, lower fuel prices and to some extent by lower interest rates,” said SIAM Deputy Director General Sugato Sen.The passenger vehicles segment, including cars, vans and utility vehicles, also posted the best-ever annual sales at 27,72,745 units, up almost eight per cent from the year-earlier period.However, two-wheeler sales continued to be weighed down by declining motorcycle sales due to a slowdown in the rural economy.Back on trackWhile SIAM said the numbers indicate that the four-wheeler segment is back on the growth track after two years of slowdown, experts said the incremental growth came from new models and the sector faced strong headwinds from abrupt policy environment changes such as the ban on diesel vehicle sales in the national capital.Amit Kaushik, Country Head at automotive consulting firm JATO Dynamics, said the growth last year was product-driven. “If we take out new products, then the growth will either be flat or negative.”Of the companies that had introduced new products, Maruti, Honda, Hyundai and Renault are the ones that had shown growth.SIAM projects auto sales will clock more than 10 per cent growth in 2015-16 as opposed to earlier expectations of 6-8 per cent growth in passenger cars but is concerned about the impact of moves such as the ban on diesel vehicles of more than 2000cc in Delhi, on vehicle sales.The inflationary impact of inputs and the clampdown on cheap metal imports from abroad could also pose significant risks to the auto industry.SIAM listed some of these risks, including the imposition of 20 per cent safeguard duty on hot-rolled steel coils, anti-dumping duty on aluminium alloy wheels imported from China, Thailand and Korea.Two-wheelers in slow laneTotal two-wheeler sales growth remained almost flat at 0.86 per cent.While sales of scooters were up almost 13 per cent at 48,80,117 units motorcycle sales during the period declined by 3.42 per cent to 1,05,23,909 units.
