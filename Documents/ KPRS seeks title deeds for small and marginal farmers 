The Karnataka Prantha Raita Sangha and other farmers’ organisations took out a rally and submitted a memorandum to the government through the district administration here on Tuesday.In the memorandum, they said that the government was not ready to provide title deeds to small and marginal farmers who had been cultivating on forest land for generations.The farmers’ leaders alleged that successive governments had not taken steps to meet their demand though the farmers had been staging agitations for years. The memorandum said that the government must amend the law to clear the legal hurdles before granting them title deeds.PlanThe farmers’ leaders demanded that the government formulate a plan for giving scientific prices to agriculture produce. They pointed out that slashing the import duty on commodities had led to a fall in the prices of locally grown varieties and the government should either stop their import or increase the duty.The memorandum said that the minimum wage for schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act should be increased to Rs. 500 a day and there should be 300 working days in a year.Noting that drought-prone district such as Vijayapura was in dire need of irrigation projects, the memorandum urged the government to complete the ongoing work of lift irrigation projects coming under stage-III of the Upper Krishna Project as early as possible.
