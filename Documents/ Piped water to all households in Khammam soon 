The long awaited proposal to provide piped drinking water to the unserved areas in the newly merged gram panchayats under Khammam Municipal Corporation limits is likely to take a concrete shape at the earliest.The civic body has earlier submitted a Detailed Project Report to the Central Government for implementation of a drinking water supply scheme exclusively meant for the newly included nine gram panchayats under the corporation limits at an estimated cost of around Rs.320 crore.The Centre has reportedly approved the DPR and given its nod for sanction of Rs. 45 crore in the first phase for implementation of the drinking water scheme under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme.The drinking water scheme meant for the unserved areas of the corporation will be implemented in a synchronised manner by integrating it with the State governmentâ€™s Water Grid scheme, sources added.Distribution pipelines will be laid to provide piped water supply to the unserved areas in the newly merged gram panchayats in the corporation limits as part of the new drinking water scheme to be taken up under the AMRUT, says G Venugopal Reddy, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Khammam.Efforts are on to sanction new municipal tap connections in the old municipal town areas, which are being covered under the drinking water augmentation scheme.
