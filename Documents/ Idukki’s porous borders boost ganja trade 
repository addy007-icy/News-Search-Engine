he Kerala-Tamil Nadu border in Idukki district continues to remain highly porous for cannabis from other States.The number of cases registered by Vandiperiyar range excise officials of late speaks volumes of the clandestine operation: as many as 63 cases in the last three months. Over 25 kg of ganja has been seized and 12 vehicles seized from the border areas during this period. Those arrested have been mostly retailers. Godowns at Cumbom and Theni are major transit points for the psychotropic drug before it is despatched to various parts of the State.The excise officials have identified the Kumily check-post on the Kollam-Theni National Highway as a major gateway for the contraband to the State.Youngsters, minorsBenny Francis, Assistant Commissioner, Excise Enforcement and Anti-narcotic Special Squad, told The Hindu on Tuesday that it is young people and minors who are mostly involved in the business. Though the number of cases has gone up, the seizures are mostly below one kilogram.There are over a dozen porous routes between Kumily and Cumbom Mettu that are unmanned and taken by workers and travellers. These could be a probable channel for the gangs in the illegal trade.It is also suspected that the gangs take the routes once used for cardamom smuggling. Besides, there are the check-posts at Kumily, Bodimettu, and Cumbom Mettu.A three-member inter-State gang arrested at Chathurangapara recently is said to be major dealers in the ganja business.According to a senior official of the Excise Department, retailers from different parts of the State reach Cumbom or Theni and take the ganja to the illegal local markets.There have been intelligence reports that ganja from Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka first reaches Palani in Tamil Nadu by train and it is then moved to different locations close to the Kerala border before being smuggled in. The arrest of a person at Vattavada recently has helped in indentifying some of the porous routes.Excise sources stress the need for coordinated efforts between the two neighbouring States to rein in the flourishing trade. They point out that it was such a coordinated action between forest officials of the two States that resulted in the arrest of the gang at Chathurangapara, which is also involved in poaching and smuggling of sandalwood.Excise officials have identified Kumily check-post as a major gateway for the contraband.
