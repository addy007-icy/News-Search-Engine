The Kochi unit of the Directorate of Intelligence on Saturday seized about 27,000 cartons of foreign cigarettes worth over Rs.8 crore from the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam.According to the officials, the container with cigarettes arrived from the Jebel Ali port in the UAE on December 31 and the consignment was addressed to Winston trading, a Chennai based importer.Acting on an intelligence input, DRI sleuths searched the container and found the cigarette sticks of four brands- Dunhill, Black, Gudang Garam and Esse cigarettes.“They were trying to smuggle the cigarettes into the country by declaring them as bed sheets and blankets,” officials said. An examination of the container revealed that its opening portion contained bed sheets and blankets, apparently aimed at misleading the investigators.“Sensing trouble, the smugglers attempted to divert the consignment to Colombo from here but we managed to offload it from the ship and shifted it a freight station nearby for detailed examinations,” they added.The seizure on Saturday marked the largest ever single haul of foreign-made cigarettes smuggled into the country through Kerala.Based on the same intelligence input, DRI sleuths simultaneously seized three more containers from Krishnapattanam, a private port in Andhra Pradesh.Preliminary investigations revealed that the smuggling was carried out by a huge network having links in the Middle East.“Cigarette smuggling offer a huge profit margin given the high tax rate in India while the investment required is much lesser when compared to gold,” said one official.The import duty for cigarettes in the country is as high as 90 per cent while the budget this year raised the excise duty by about 25 per cent, making cigarette smuggling even more attractive.Smuggling of cigarettes is regarded as one of the factors impacting the domestic manufacturers. Moreover, those smuggled foreign cigarettes do not bear statutory health warning.“Further investigation is on to apprehend those concerned,’’ officials said.
