When she reaches her home later during the day on Sunday, the four-month-old baby girl of Debbadiwar Vijayalakshmi and Rakesh of Adilabad town will be doing so as the holder of a record. Yes, she has become the smallest baby at 650 gm of weight at the time of her birth, to survive in a government hospital in Telangana State. Revealing this at a press conference here, nodal officer of the Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Adilabad, Suryakant Mundlod said it was a challenging task to bring back the baby from certain death.The baby was born prematurely on September 9, last year, at the SNCU through a caesarean section and the baby weighed about a fourth of the normal weight of 2.5 kg for children at the time of birth.“We struggled to maintain its normal body temperature while keeping it free from infections. The baby was fed mother’s milk and now she is 1.9 kg with normal vision and intellect,” he added. Forest Minister Jogu Ramanna and RIMS Director A. Ashok complimented Dr. Mundlod for his efforts.
