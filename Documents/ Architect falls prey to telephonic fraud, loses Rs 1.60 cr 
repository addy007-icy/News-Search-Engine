A 75-year-old retired architect from Mumbai fell prey to a prolonged telephonic fraud plotted in New Delhi, in which the accused cheated him of Rs 1.60 crore over two years. Following the victim’s complaint, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has now initiated investigations into the matter.According to police sources, the victim stays in Borivali with his family. In 2014, he got a call from a New Delhi number. The caller claimed to be working with the bank where the victim has an account.The caller claimed that he had some good pension schemes and after a lengthy conversation during which several ‘schemes’ were discussed, the caller convinced the victim to transfer Rs 37,000 as the first premium, and promised him huge returns.A month later, the victim got a call from another New Delhi number. The caller, this time, was a different person and claimed to be from the Income-Tax department. “Using a lot of complicated jargon, the caller convinced the victim that if he paid an additional amount of money along with the ‘premium’ that he had already paid, he would be eligible for a higher level of tax exemption. The victim then transferred Rs 40,000 to another account specified by the caller,” said a police officer.Over the next two years, the victim kept getting calls from different numbers and the callers posed as either officials from some government department or the other, or as bank employees, and in numerous instalments, convinced him to pay a total of Rs 1.60 crore. “The accused always took the money in small instalments. On one occasion, one of the accused even collected Rs 2 lakh in cash at the Bandra Kurla Complex, saying that an urgent payment was required,” said the officer.Finally, in January this year, the victim approached the police. In a letter to the office of the Mumbai Police Commissioner, he narrated the entire sequence events and requested help.The matter was then handed over to the Property Cell of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch for further investigation, and an FIR of cheating and impersonation was registered against unidentified persons on January 16 this year.
