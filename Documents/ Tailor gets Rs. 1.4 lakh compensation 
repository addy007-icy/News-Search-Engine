Declaring the termination of a tailor’s services as illegal, a Labour court here has awarded him a compensation of Rs. 1.4 lakh.Manoj Kumar, who joined A.D. Gear International in 2010, alleged that the management did not issue any appointment letter or offer facilities like a pay slip, provident fund or Employees’ State Insurance.When he claimed these facilities, he was only offered assurances. Kumar said he was ultimately dismissed and his wages for March and 13 days in April, 2013, were withheld.The management, which contended that he had quit of his own accord, expressed readiness to take him back. The Judge, however, dismissed the management’s contention saying that “it has failed to prove any record regarding absence of the workman from duty”.“Had the claimant absented from duty, the management would have sent letters But there is nothing on record,” the Judge observed.
