Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin must take place in order for the countries to forge a peace treaty.Japan and Russia never signed a peace treaty after World War II because of territorial disputes over islands north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido.Mr. Abe told reporters in a new year’s news conference on Monday that both leaders share the view that the lack of a peace accord is “abnormal.”Mr. Abe says Japan’s often tense relations with China and South Korea are “normalizing” following a summit in Seoul and he hopes for further progress.
