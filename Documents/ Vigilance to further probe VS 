Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau Director N. Sankar Reddy has rejected a probe report seeking prosecution of Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan in connection with the suspected anomaly in the appointment of K.V. Sankaran as director of the Kerala Forest Research Institute in Thrissur in 2007. Mr. Achuthanandan was the Chief Minister at the time and he had chosen Mr. Sankaran from a panel of three candidates. One K. Jayarajan, who thought his eligibility for the post had been deliberately overlooked, moved the Vigilance court, Thrissur, accusing graft and conspiracy in the appointment of Mr. Sankaran.His case was that Mr. Achuthanandan had conspired with other government officials to bypass him and appoint Mr. Sankaran as Director of the institution. The court ordered an inquiry. The investigating officer filed a report stating that there was ground to prosecute Mr. Achuthanandan in the case. Mr. Reddy, who reviewed the report, sent it back on the ground that the role of Mr. Achuthanandan in the ‘erroneous appointment’ had to be probed in detail. Mr. Reddy ordered the case be further inquired.
