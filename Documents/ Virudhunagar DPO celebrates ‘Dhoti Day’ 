For a section of policemen and officials and male ministerial staff at the District Police Office, Wednesday was a break from their mundane khakhi uniform or the full pants of different hue. Everyone had come in white dhoti to office.When Superintendent of Police P. Aravindhan suggested to celebrate ‘Dhoti Day’, they readily accepted the suggestion.“Only yesterday, I made the suggestion. And almost all the ministerial staff and other police officials on duty today at the DPO turned up in dhoti,” Mr. Aravidhan said.It was a good feeling for everyone to be part of the State government’s celebration of the Dhoti Day.“As dhoti is the Tamil’s own traditional attire, many took pride in celebrating it,” Mr. Aravidhan added.The SP, who himself turned up in dhoti, said that he had appealed to his staff to buy dhoti at a Co-optex showroom, if at all someone had to buy one for the occasion.
