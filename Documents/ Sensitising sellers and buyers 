With just a day remaining for the Sankranti festival, has the decision to impose ban on the use of Chinese manja for flying kites by the State government come a tad late? Is it just a pyrrhic victory for animal rights activists? While agreeing that the time given for the police to impose such a ban is too less, animal rights activists have pointed out that making traders aware about ill-effects of the Chinese manja had started last year.“Awareness is the only way to spread the ill-effects of using Chinese threads to fly kites. In fact, for the past one year, we have been interacting with the kite wholesale dealers in old city to make them aware about the environmental impact of the Chinese dor,” says Shreya Paropkari, cruelty response manager, HSI. In the past ten months, the HSI had held a few workshops on the issue with nearly 50 top wholesale traders for kites from old city. “We were encouraged by the positive attitude of traders because they too were keen on not selling the product. In fact, they felt that Chinese threads were impacting the local cotton thread manufacturers. We will continue to make traders and festival revellers aware about the ill-effects in addition to consistently interacting with police to implement the ban,” animal activists said.
