SpaceX is an American space vehicle manufacturing company which was founded in 2002 (13 years ago). It has its headquarters in Hawthorne, California. It was founded by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla motors. In 2002, Elon met the renowned rocket engineer Tom Mueller. Tom agreed to work for Elon Musk and SpaceX was formed. SpaceX launched three rockets that were unsuccessful.SpaceX was in the news in December 2015. On December 14, SpaceXâ€™s rocket Falcon-9 landed safely. Instead of falling into the sea, it landed in the same place from where it was launched. This is significant because normally rockets burn-up on re-entry into the atmosphere, and some parts would have to be fixed again. This would cost more money. The making cost of a Falcon rocket is around the same as that of a Jumbo Jet. But, since the Falcon-9 landed safely without burning up it could be reused. Hence it could reduce the cost of launches in the future. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) already has its own launch vehicles and is working on improving the engines. In the future, there will be lot of competition amongst countries in this field.Nalin Gabriel Prabindh, V G, Bishop Cotton Boys School, Bengaluru
