Taking exception to terming aged cows as “unproductive”, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has sought to know “whether anyone could declare women aged above 30 as unmarriageable.” The Minister’s reply came in response to a query on the law allowing slaughter of “unproductive” cows and farmers selling them to slaughterhouses. She said the issue of cow slaughter has been politicised as people have not been informed about the ‘economics’ of rearing a cow. “When people understand the economics of rearing cows, then automatically farmers will stop selling them,” she said.
