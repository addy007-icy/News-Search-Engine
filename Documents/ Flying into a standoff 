Through its deployment of a B-52 bomber in response to North Korea’s claims of having successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, the U.S. is only aggravating the ongoing Korean peninsula crisis. It is also indulging in gross doublespeak by calling for talks between India and Pakistan when India is still smarting from the Pathankot airbase terror attack (“ >U.S. flies straight into Korean standoff,” Jan.11).The irony is that while the U.S. hounds a nation like North Korea, notwithstanding the sordid humanitarian crisis the isolated nation faces, it keeps pumping in economic and military aid to Pakistan, knowing very well that some of it is getting diverted to anti-India activities. The least the U.S. can do is to practise what it preaches to other nations and, instead of flexing its military muscles at North Korea, seek the diplomatic route to resolve the crisis in the Korean peninsula.Nalini Vijayaraghavan,Thiruvananthapuram
