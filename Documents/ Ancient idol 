An ancient Siva Lingam belonging to the 14th century was discovered in crop fields at Chintalavaripalle of Valmikipuram mandal, 150 km from here, on Wednesday, when a farmer, Jitendra was levelling his land. Workers on the earth mover stopped the machine after noticing the lingam. It was retrieved from the ground. Valmikipuram CI Sridhar Naidu and SI Mallikarjuna shifted the lingam to Kameswara Swami temple at Valmikipuram. A history faculty from a Madanapalle College said that going by the features of the lingam, it seemed to belong to the Vijayanagara era.
