Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has said that the Congress will win in more than 20 districts in the zilla panchyat elections.Speaking to reporters after attending a programme here on Tuesday, he said that the Congress believes in decentralisation of power and it was mainly responsible for strengthening the panchayat raj system, giving power to women and youth by creating opportunities.Some political parties do not believe in decentralisation of power and they have made attempts to curb the powers of gram panchayats during their rule in the State. It is only the Congress that has maintained the panchayat raj system intact and in fact, it had taken steps to strengthen it, the Chief Minister said.The Congress is completely prepared to face the taluk and zilla panchayat elections and it would go to the polls by taking every leader of the party into confidence, he added.
