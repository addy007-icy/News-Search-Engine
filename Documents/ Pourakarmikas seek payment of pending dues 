Pourakarmikas of the Mandya City Municipal Council (CMC), working on contract basis, on Tuesday staged a protest outside the municipal office here demanding salary that has pending for 10 months now.Over 100 pourakarmikas have not received their salaries since April 2015. This has made them borrow money from pawn brokers and other sources, to meet expenses during Makara Sankranti, the protesters said.According to them, the civic authority was showing step-motherly attitude towards contract workers, when salaries of permanent workers were being paid on time. In spite of repeated protests and submitting memoranda, the officials concerned had not initiated any measures to release the pending dues, they said.Later, they submitted a memorandum to in-charge Commissioner Devaraj and president Lokesh of the CMC.
