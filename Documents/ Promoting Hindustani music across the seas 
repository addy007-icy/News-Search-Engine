: Listening to Tripti Mukherjee sing Kan Kahani is such a pleasure. Her silken voice and the expressions she gives to the lines would catch your imagination in no time.The way she sang those songs, composed by her guru Pandit Jasraj 45 years ago, underscores her talent as a Hindustani vocalist. You would also feel she could do pretty well in lighter music as well.“I have learnt ghazals from Shipra Bose and I enjoy listening to Mehdi Hassan, though I have not done any lighter version of music beyond bhajans ,” says Tripti, who was in Kozhikode a couple of days ago to accompany Jasraj for his concert. “But, I am open to the idea of doing some kind of light music.”For the moment though, she is committed to promoting Hindustani music in the U.S. She founded the Pandit Jasraj Institute of Music in New York.“We have many students in North America and there are quite a few good singers among them,” she says. “Our institute has helped keep the Hindustani music alive in the U.S.” For her contribution to promoting Hindustani music beyond the borders of India, she was honoured with the Padma Shri last year. “It was a big surprise for me,” she says. “When the official from the Home Ministry called me up and asked if I was willing to accept the Padma Shri, I could not say anything for 30 seconds.”Tripti, who belongs to the Mewati Gharana of Hindustani music, began singing at a very young age. She feels blessed that she could become a disciple of Jasraj.“I was at school, in Kolkata, when I fell in love with his voice on All India Radio,” she recalls. “When he came to Kolkata for a concert, I met him and told him that I wanted to be his disciple. For that, I moved to Mumbai.”She feels Hindustani music and other classical arts of India need more encouragement, especially from the government and the media. “Artistes like me need more platforms to perform,” she says.
