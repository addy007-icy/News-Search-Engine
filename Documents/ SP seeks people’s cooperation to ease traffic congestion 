Superintendent of Police Ghattamaneni Srinivas on Monday underscored the need for active public participation in solving the traffic-related issues in urban areas.Addressing an awareness meet on ‘Traffic problems and Public participation’ here, the SP said that with growing congestion in urban areas, the role of public groups in providing effective solutions to traffic snarls was vital, adding that though there was good response from people and commercial establishments in streamlining the traffic in several congested streets, more awareness was needed at the grass-roots level.The SP observed that if people followed the traffic norms that would contribute a lot to the problem. He felt that a small step to ensure free flow of traffic would lead to hassle-free movement of ambulance services, saving of many lives.Mr. Srinivas sought the traffic wing in Chittoor to chalk out an action plan to involve the public groups in a big way to find immediate solutions to the traffic related issues.
