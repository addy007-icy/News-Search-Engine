Particles small enough to enter the bloodstream are being monitored for the first time by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which will collect data from 200 locations during the 15-day odd-even experiment.Particulate matter that is one or less microns in diameter (PM1) is being studied by the DPCC through its mobile monitoring instruments that are driving across the city to collect samples. So far, the DPCC has been monitoring levels of fine and coarse particulate matter, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively.“For the first time in the country, PM1 is being studied extensively at 200 locations and over a period of 15 days,” Delhi government spokesperson Nagendar Sharma said on Monday.Not much is known about PM1 and there are no regulations regarding it, but it is safe to say that it has serious health implications.“The smaller the particle, the more dangerous it is. PM1 is harmful because it gets embedded deep into the lungs and can enter the blood stream,” said Anumita Roychowdhuy, the head of Centre for Science and Environment’s clean air campaign.She added that PM1 is linked to combustion, so its level in the air cannot be attributed to dust or natural sources. Studying the levels of PM1 would help policy-makers come up with new pollution-control measures, said a senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official.“By the end of the 15 days, we will analyse the PM1 data to have better insights into what is causing pollution in Delhi,” said the official.In June 2015, the Union Earth Science Ministry’s SAFAR monitored the levels of PM1 for the first time in Delhi. A study had been carried out in West Bengal as well in the past.Meanwhile, the DPCC’s analysis of the first two days of the odd-even policy, showed “encouraging” trends, as per the government. On January 2, PM2.5 and PM10 levels in 15 locations across the city were between 136 and 243 micrograms per cubic metre and 137 and 734 micrograms per cubic metre respectively.“Measurements in nine of the locations in Central and South Delhi were less compared to previous years at this time of the year — for both PM2.5 and PM10,” said a government statement.What is PM1?Ultrafine particulate matter that are 1 or less microns in diameter. A micron is one/25,000th ofan inchWhy is it important?The particles are so small that they get deep into the lungs and can enter the blood stream, leading to a range of pollution-related diseases
