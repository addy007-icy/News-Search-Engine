The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has captured stunning images of ‘snowzilla’ blizzard from space that has walloped eastern U.S., killing at least 14 people and paralysing road, rail and air traffic.The massive winter storm system pummelled the U.S., dumping nearly 58 cm of snow in suburbs of Washington DC to New York, with two low-pressure systems merging into a potent nor’easter that dropped heavy snow from Virginia to New England.A nor’easter (also northeaster) is a macro-scale storm along the East Coast of the U.S. and Atlantic Canada.This image taken by NOAA's GOES-East satellite on Thursday, shows the winter snowstorm over the East Coast of the United States. (NOAA GOES Project/NASA via AP)The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite acquired the images of the winter storm system.“Snow totals have topped 30 inches in at least four states, and at least 12 inches have been recorded at locations in eight states, with many more hours left to the storm,” NASA said in a statement.According to various news reports, at least 14 people have died storm-related deaths and thousands spent a night stranded in cars and trucks on highways in Pennsylvania and Kentucky.At least 9,500 flights have been cancelled and citizens were ordered to stay off the roads in some cities and towns.
