A new-look, resurgent India holds the opportunity to claim a first bilateral series victory of any sort in Australia — as much as these things matter — in the second KFC Twenty20 International at the MCG here on Friday.India will be optimistic not least because of the manner in which Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin shackled Australia in Adelaide.With the scoreboard exerting pressure of its own, the home team’s batsmen were forced to attempt big hits against spin, leading to their demise.Ashwin went for 17 from his first over, but finished with figures of two for 28 from four overs. There was turn for Jadeja during the third ODI here. That and the MCG’s immense square boundaries mean the two bowlers may expect more joy.Winning combinationIndia will not feel the need to tinker with a winning combination — something arrived at after a struggle during the one-day series. Ajinkya Rahane, recovering from a split webbing, faced only gentle throws-down in the nets, and that after all the other batsmen had finished. He is unlikely to be risked.For Australia’s part, David Warner and Steve Smith will be missing from the squad for the next two matches in order to prepare for their team’s ODI series in New Zealand.Glenn Maxwell’s return to fitness, however, will be welcomed. It rained briefly on Thursday afternoon, with more showers forecast for Friday, although that means little in Melbourne, with its notoriously fickle weather.The teams (from):India: M.S. Dhoni (Capt.), R. Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Rishi Dhawan, Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Gurkeerat Mann, Ashish Nehra, Hardik Pandya, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Umesh Yadav.Australia: Aaron Finch (Capt.), Scott Boland, Cameron Boyce, James Faulkner, John Hastings, Travis Head, Chris Lynn, Nathan Lyon, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Kane Richardson, Shaun Tait, Andrew Tye, Matthew Wade and Shane Watson.Umpires: Simon Fry and Paul Wilson.Match starts at 2 p.m. IST
