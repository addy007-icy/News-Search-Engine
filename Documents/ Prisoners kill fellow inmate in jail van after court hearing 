In yet another incident of violence reported from jail vans, a 28-year-old prison inmate was allegedly beaten to death by three other undertrials while they were being transported from Saket court to Tihar Central jail on Saturday.According to the police, the incident took place when the inmates were being brought back to the jail after a court hearing. Though there were around 30-35 other inmates in the van, no one tried to save the victim, sources said.The victim has been identified as Manoj. “The incident took place around 1-45 p.m. when the inmates Manoj, Vishal, Raju and Salman and others were being taken back to the prison after a court hearing and a fight broke out among them,” said a senior police official.“There was an argument between Manoj and Vishal and soon it led to a scuffle, following which the driver of the prison van stopped the vehicle near the IIT flyover and called up the police control room (PCR),” the official added.When the PCR team reached the spot, they decided not to open the gate of the van as the prisoners could have tried to escape. The van was taken to the Hauz Khas police station, the official said.“When the gates of the van were opened Manoj was found lying in a pool of blood and was rushed to the AIIMS Trauma Centre where he was declared dead on arrival. A case of murder has been registered and the accused have been arrested,” DCP (South) Prem Nath said. He added that no weapon was used in the attack.During interrogation, police found out that Manoj had an enmity with Vishal and Raju since 2012 and they had often fought with each other inside the jail premises. After the heated argument on Saturday, Vishal and Raju, along with their associate Salman, allegedly thrashed Manoj to death, said the police.In a similar incident reported in August 2015, two prison inmates were allegedly beaten to death by seven others, including an infamous outer Delhi-based gangster, in a fight that broke out inside the van heading from Rohini court to Tihar jail.The incident led to a blame-game between the Delhi Police and the Delhi Prisons.
