With the CBSE announcing that public examinations will begin for Class XII and Class X on March 1 and 2 respectively, schools in the flood-hit districts are working overtime to complete the syllabus and ensure students cope with the pressure.While Class XII students are preparing for revision exams and extra classes, many school principals said it would be a fight to the finish for Class X students. In the rains and floods that ravaged the northern districts of Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore, students had lost more than a month of working days. Besides, textbooks of many students were washed away in the floods.“Extra classes and making all Saturdays working days would help complete portions and revision for Class X students,” said Ajeeth Prasad Jain, secretary, Chennai Sahodaya Schools Complex.For Class XII, most schools usually ensure they have at least three rounds of revision exams which have now been reduced to two . The pre-board or model examinations for Class XII begin from January 20 in most CBSE schools.In mid-December, a plea was rejected by the Madras High Court to reduce the syllabus and postpone the Class X and XII CBSE board exams in the flood affected areas. The court said it was optimistic about the potential of the students to rise to the occasion.The principal of a CBSE school in South Chennai admitted they were concerned about the time left for Class X students as they also had to take up Formative Assessment (FA) activities and the time consuming Assessment of Speaking and Listening (ASL) for English.“Since the portions have to be completed and the FA activities be conducted simultaneously, there will be a bit of a rush. We are motivating the teachers and ensuring that students are able to manage,” she said.Public exams will begin for Class XII and Class X on March 1 and 2 respectively
