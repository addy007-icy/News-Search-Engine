James Faulkner’s attempt to engage India’s Virat Kohli in a war of words during the third ODI in Melbourne backfired on the Australian paceman as the star batsman emphatically told him to just keep bowling as “I have smashed you enough in my life”.Kohli, who became the fastest to reach 7000 ODI runs and 24 centuries en route a run-a-ball 117 in a losing cause at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, was batting on 73 when Faulkner tried to rile up the batsman.“You’re wasting your energy. There’s no point, I’ve smashed you enough in my life. Just go and bowl,” Kohli was heard telling Faulkner, who challenged the Indian to go after his bowling.“Smile. Having fun aren’t we?” the Australian responded.The incident happened as Kohli completed a single at the non-striker’s end when Faulkner was returning to his bowling mark in the 35th over of the Indian innings. Faulkner tried to instigate Kohli, who is also known for his aggressive attitude, and the batsman responded in kind. Their utterances were caught in the stump microphone.Kohli’s effort was the highlight of India’s outing at the MCG, where they conceded the five-match ODI series 0-3 to the hosts after yet another sloppy performance.Batting first, India scored 295 for six in 50 overs with Kohli doing the bulk of scoring. In reply, Australia never looked in trouble as they knocked off the required runs with 1.1 overs still remaining.However, while surpassing the twin milestones in just his 161st innings, Kohli got the better of the Australian bowling attack at the hallowed turf.
