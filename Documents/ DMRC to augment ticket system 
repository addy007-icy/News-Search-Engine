The Delhi Metro is all set to augment the ticketing system of stations falling under phases I and II. The project will cover about 100 metro stations, with special emphasis on unattended ticket sales. Under the project, a total of 240 additional access gates and 300 ticket vending machines (TVM) will be installed.In addition, 150 automatic vending machines (AVM) dedicated for card top up will also be put up.Installation of the access gates is scheduled to be delivered by next month and completed by September 2016.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials said French firm, Thales Group, has won the contract for the project.“As part of this upgrade, additional ticketing machines and access gates will be provided to improve passenger travel facilities and comfort,” the company said. Phase I of the Delhi Metro is 65 km, while phase II is 125 km.Under the upcoming phase III, the DMRC is planning to focus on TVMs. Instead of setting up ticket counters, as has been the usual practice, the 135.4-km phase III network with 93 stations will have as many as 506 AVMs.There are only 170 TVMs in the existing 147 metro stations, including six of the Airport Express Line, in Delhi-NCR. These machines are installed in just 82 of the total stations. With 16 TVMs, the busy Rajiv Chowk station currently tops the list with the highest vending machines in the Delhi Metro.“Most countries rely completely on automated machines in metro journeys; It will not only help save time, but also help in cutting down on the workforce. There is going to be almost a 300 per cent increase in reliability on automatic ticket generation in the new metro stations,” said an official.
