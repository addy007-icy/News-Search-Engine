Sourav Kothari had a promise to keep. His father, Manoj, was a name to reckon with in the world of billiards. The legacy was a worthy motivation and Sourav capped his brilliant run in this edition of the National championship by claiming the title with a 5-2 verdict overSiddharth Parikh here on Saturday.It was a quality contest with each responding to the challenge. “I thought he played brilliantly. He set up a fine battle with a century break in the opening frame itself,” said Kothari even as Parikh congratulated him warmly. The camaraderie was not to be missed even though Parikh, on his maiden entry to the final, had high hopes of winning.“It is a gentle sport. No punching in the air. We know each other well, travel a lot together, have a meal together. The rivalry is healthy,” remarked Kothari.Parikh said, “The pressure of playing my first final played on my mind. I started late but it was not the same as yesterday [when he beat Pankaj Advani]. I think Sourav played very well, potted the ball like a champion.” Parikh set the standards for the final with a break of 100 in the opening frame but Kothari responded with an unfinished break of 120. Kothari swept the second frame comfortably and breaks of 137 and 115 ensured he remained on the right track. At 4-0, it appeared a runaway finish for Kothari.Kothari faced resistance in the fifth and sixth frames when Parikh raised his game with breaks of 112 and an unfinished 145.The result (final): Sourav Kothari beat Siddharth Parikh 5-2 (154-112, 150-112, 150-82, 151-15, 104-151, 93-150, 150-31).
