Water crisis at University of Hyderabad is likely to get worse. In December, Manjeera water supply to the institution declined drastically and the university drafted an emergency plan to complete the course early and curtail the semester.But that plan might take a hit given the current situation as classes have been suspended for the past week in the aftermath of 25-year-old Rohith Vemula’s suicide on January 17.According to a senior official from UoH, after the Manjeera water supply came down to just 25 per cent in the month of December, a few bore-wells were dug up on the campus, but they were not able to bridge the shortage. “It didn’t work out, so we began getting tankers instead,” he informed.There are 20 hostels in UoH, with abut 3,500 people residing in them.Given the shortage and the situation at hand, officials decided to end the semester a month early by the first week of April.But with the ongoing protests after Rohith’s death, it seems unlikely that the semester could be wrapped up soon if the impasse continues.The official said that the varsity used to get about 10 lakh litres of water a day from Manjeera supplied by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB). With that gone, the deficiency is now being supplemented through bore-wells and water tankers from which the administration gets about 1 to 1.5 lakh litres a month.In total, the varsity is spending about Rs. 8 to Rs. 9 lakh on water a month, informed the official. When contacted, Prakash Babu, Dean of Students’ Welfare, said there is a possibility of taking extra classes, given the current circumstances.Students from the campus also said that if the water supply stops for even a day, it would cause huge problems for those living in the campus. “Our hostels start stinking if the water supply stops even for a day in summer,” said Akaash, an UG student.Meeting held at LamakaanScholars from UoH and members from civil society here met and discussed the problems of caste discrimination at Lamakaan on Saturday evening.They expressed concern over the current discourse, stating that the issue of Rohith Vemula’s caste is being deliberately raised to divert attention. In support of the deceased, a solidarity march will be held in the city on January 25.
