The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) was unveiled in 2002 with the goal of providing quality education to all. On April 1, 2010, the Right to Education came into force to ensure free and compulsory education to all children from the ages of 6 to 14, thus increasing the focus on primary education. Today, the SSA is being implemented in all States and Union Territories in the country.The SSA, Kerala, has come out with a documentary film ‘Vidyabhyasam Avakasham’ highlighting the activities and achievements of the SSA in primary education.The documentary, produced by SSA Kerala Project Director E.P. Mohandas, aims at providing an accurate picture of the education sector. It has been scripted by P.S. Geethakumari, media and documentation officer, SSA, and is expected to convey to the public the activities successfully undertaken by the SSA.

The abilities of differently abled children, the gains made by students belonging to other States, attempts to bring children from the minority communities into the mainstream, efforts to better girl children’s educational and other opportunities and their social involvement are all detailed in the documentary.The achievements of government schools in areas such as physical infrastructure, improvement of teaching standards, and tapping the potential of information and communications technology are woven in.While capping the work done so far, thrust is on the activities undertaken in the 2014-15 year.
