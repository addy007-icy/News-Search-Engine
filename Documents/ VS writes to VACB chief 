Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has written to Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) director N. Sankar Reddy seeking an investigation against Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala based on the order issued by the Thiruvananthapuram Vigilance Court in the Travancore Titanium Limited case.A press note issued by the Opposition Leader’s office here on Sunday said that Mr. Chandy was the first accused in the case before the Vigilance court. The court had directed the VACB to include all the accused in the case before it in the FIR and begin investigation. Although one week had elapsed after the Vigilance court’s verdict, the VACB had not cared to take follow-up action. The audit wing of the VACB had found losses totalling Rs.165.98 crore in the deals that had given rise to the case. If there is no immediate action on the part of the VACB, he would be constrained to move for contempt of court against the Vigilance Director, Mr. Achuthanandan said.— Special Correspondent
