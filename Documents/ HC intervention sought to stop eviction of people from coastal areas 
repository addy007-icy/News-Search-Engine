Asserting that schemes for rehabilitation of flood-affected people should be done without evicting them from their area of dwelling, particularly people in the coastal areas of Chennai and its suburban areas dependent on the sea for their livelihood, an advocate has approached the High Court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue.Advocate R.M.D. Nasrullah submitted a letter along with a petition before the First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice M. Sathyanarayanan enunciating the need for the court’s intervention.Pointing out a proposal made by the government to rehabilitate the affected people in the costal areas by evicting them to other suitable places, Mr. Nasrullah said, “The proposal made by the government is apparently laudable. But, the hardship of the people who are to be evicted to some other area has to be borne in mind because any policy of rehabilitation should be economically feasible and viable causing least harm to the affected people.“Unfortunately, the authorities have not disturbed the peaceful existence of other posh establishments in the alleged areas of encroachment,” he said. After hearing the arguments, the Bench forwarded the letter along with the petition to the High Court registry for action.
