Tension prevailed from morning till noon outside the gate of Deccan Fine Chemicals, the factory where a huge fire broke out on Sunday evening. The police present had to resort to mild lathi-charge to quell the agitation.Over 2,000 residents from Rajavaram of Payakaraopeta mandal in Visakhapatnam district, where the factory is located, and from other neighbouring villages such as Gajapathinagaram, Rajanagaram, Kesavaram, and Venkatnagaram gathered at the factoryâ€™s gate and demanded that the factory be immediately closed or the villages be shifted from its vicinity.Narsipatnam RDO Korada Surya Rao was gheraoed and even chased up to a distance.The residents where so agitated with what they called the lackadaisical response from the authorities that they resorted to stone pelting, prompting the police to resort to a mild lathi-charge.M. Appalaraju, a resident and CPI (M) activist, said the villagers were upset as they faced some breathing problem due to the thick fumes.The villagers were also upset with the company as it was the second major fire accident in the last two years.On April 11, 2014, fire broke out at the same plant that left two dead and about 26 injured. Meanwhile, a delegation from the Forum for Development of North Andhra, led by Ajay Sharma, and J.V. Ratnam of Green Climate met the officials of the Joint Chief Inspector of Factories and submitted a memorandum seeking immediate action against Deccan Fine Chemicals and safety audit of all pharmaceutical and chemical factories in the district.The Pharma and Chemical units in the district have been seeing a string of fire accidents in the last couple of years.According to P. Chinna Rao, Deputy Joint Chief of Inspector of Factories, there have been about 10 accidents in the last couple of years and cases filed in all the instances. But there has been no concrete outcome, he says.
