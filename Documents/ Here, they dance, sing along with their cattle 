Hamlets around the historic 500-year-old Al Kondammal temple in Udumalpet taluk become vibrant in the weeks leading up to Pongal as farmers perform dances wearing customary attires and play music with traditional instruments, all along with their cattle, as a ritual.The ceremony is held without losing its sheen and traditional fervour for the over many centuries.The oxen were made to dance to the tunes of ‘Urumi music’ and men will symbolically intercept the oxen with sticks while dancing themselves.The women of the hamlets perform ‘kummi,’ a folk dance, to teach the girls rich moral values.“A fascinating aspect of the celebrations is that any calf born on ‘mattu pongal’ day will be donated to the temples in respective hamlets, including Al Kondammal temple, with people assuming that the said cattle belongs to the God.Moreover, the people will not make such cattle wear the thread which is usually put on them through the nose after it attains a certain age”, S. Ravikumar, historian of Virarajendran Archaeological Research Centre, told The Hindu .
