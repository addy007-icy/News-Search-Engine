The deportation was on technical grounds, but the return was dramatic.Within hours of deportation from Hyderabad to Abu Dhabi by immigration officials at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here on Thursday, Pakistan singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan returned to enthral the audience albeit a bit late. The noted singer landed at the airport in Shamshabad on Thursday morning to perform at a New Year party at the Falaknuma Palace in old city. But, an unexpected obstacle came when the Immigration officials at the airport threw the rule book on his face and told the celebrity singer that he cannot enter the city since he didn’t comply with the mandatory rules for Pakistan nationals. According to reports, officials told him that Pakistan nationals can enter India only through Delhi, Mumbai or Chennai airports.Since, Khan flew in from Abu Dhabi to Hyderabad, the rules didn’t permit his direct entry into the city. The singer had no option, but to return Abu Dhabi. From Abu Dhabi, he flew to Delhi by another flight.As time was running out, the singer dashed to Hyderabad by a chartered flight.This time he had no ‘rule related’ issues since he had complied with the procedure.The singer was driven straight to the hotel where he gave the performance though a few hours behind the schedule.Unaware of all the happenings, most of the members of the audience seemed to have enjoyed the performance to the hilt.“Though Rahat’s performance started at 11 p.m., it was just awesome. This probably is my best New Year’s bash till date. He went on to sing for almost four hours and the crowd thoroughly enjoyed it,” said a socialite, Saritha Lohiya.
