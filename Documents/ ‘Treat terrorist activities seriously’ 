Expressing extreme satisfaction over the law enforcement activities in the twin cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar during 2015, police commissioner Dr R. P. Sharma on Monday, however, cautioned the commissionerate police to take serious note of the terrorist activities in the twin cities and to be more watchful.The warning came in the backdrop of recent arrest of a suspected terrorist of Al-Qaeda from Cuttack by the Delhi Police and the arrests of at least seven Bangladeshi nationals by the Bhubaneswar police for allegedly trying to procure passports submitting fake documents.“These incidents should not be ignored and the commissionerate police should sincerely take note of the developments by generating its own sources and taking proactive measures to check such activities in the twin cities,” the police commissioner said.“Unlike other parts in the country, particularly in North India and metro cities, terrorist activities in Odisha are not there,” Mr. Sharma said.
