A mobile app that can act as a perfect grievance redressal system for citizens’ civic woes at a micro-level was launched on Friday. Developed by a techie, Mohd. Abulumair, the app ‘local leader’ connects citizens with the local activists, leaders, officials and corporators to act on issues. All one has to do is click a picture that can convey glaring examples of bad civic conditions or social issues and upload it through the app.The USP of the app is that based on the location, the complaint automatically reaches the chosen representatives of that particular area. To align with this system, the app developer has created accounts of the members and leaders so that they can act quicker upon getting the notifications.“I developed this app so that there should be some connect between the people and the local leaders,” said Mr. Abulumair, who runs an IT firm ITS creation.“Whether it is garbage problem or water scarcity, the complainant has to just click a picture and write about the issue in a few lines and upload. This can be immediately seen by not just local political leaders, but also officials, activists and rest of the app users.”The app also has options which help the citizens know about the status of their complaint.“Once the complaint reaches them, the member can select an option through which people will know that certain leader is working on that issue. The member can also select ‘Resolved Issue’ option to convey that problem has been addressed. However, they have to upload an image as proof to back their claims,” said Mr. Abulumair.The app will have profiles of the selected leaders with updates regarding their responses and actions to complaints. The app, available on Google Playstore, will also be released in iOS platform.
