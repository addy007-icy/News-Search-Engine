A three-member delegation of the Bharatiya Janta Party ( BJP) was, on Monday, prevented by the police from visiting Kaliachak in West Bengal's Malda district.MPs Bhupendra Yadav, Vishnu Dayal Ram and S.S. Ahluwalia, along with some State BJP functionaries, disembarked at Malda Town station at around 6 a.m. The police and district administration did not allow them to come out of the Station premises.Senior police and district officials told the delegation that Kaliachak remains peaceful but prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code have been imposed in the area.The delegation was sent to Kolkata by the next train from Malda.On Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah had constituted a three-member delegation comprising these MPs. They were on a 'fact-finding' mission to Kaliachak.The team is expected to address a press conference later in the day in Kolkata.PTI adds:“The purpose of the visit was to console the people, to restore their confidence that something like this will not happen in future. Due to pressure from the State Government, the district administration said that we cannot go there as Section 144 CrPC has been imposed. We are not here to incite or instigate anyone. We are law-abiding citizens and senior MPs but the officials said that that we are public figures and our appearance will create problems....the normalcy they have achieved will break down,” Mr. Ahluwalia said.On January 6, another BJP delegation led by Shamik Bhattacharya, its lone MLA in West Bengal Assembly, was not allowed to visit Kaliachak village.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said there was no communal tension in the area and described the incident as a fallout of an issue between the BSF and the local people.Several policemen have been transferred from Kaliachak police station following the incident.
