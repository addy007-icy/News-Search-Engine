The 56th State School Arts Festival attracted good crowds on Thursday. The turnouts were hardly impressive on the first two days, more so when you compare the festivals held in recent years, in places such as Kozhikode, Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram.Parents' protestBut on the third day, the main venue at the Putharikkandam Ground was nearly full for Kerala Nadanam (Higher Secondary girls). However, much like the start of Mohiniyattam (Higher Secondary girls) on Wednesday at the VJT Hall, there was drama outside the stage at Putharikkandam, too. Five participants were not allowed to perform after reporting late. They, however, protested, by going up the stage, along with their parents. That disrupted the competition. Finally, the issue was resolved when the girls were allowed to perform, but not as part of the competition. The protests delayed Kuchipudi by several hours.Main attractionsOne of the biggest attractions of the day was mimicry, a perennial favourite at the school festival. There was a packed house to witness High School girls perform an art that one is normally associated with males.Another crowd favourite, mono act, was held at Government Womenâ€™s College Auditorium, Vazhuthacaud.The day also featured competitions in Triple Jazz, Poorakkali, Duff Muttu, Mappilappattu, English skit, Ottanthullal, Chakyarkoothu, Kathakali, Chendamelam, Malayalam recitation, light music, classical music and violin.
