As the sun reached overhead, for many assembled at the hot and dusty Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Neyyattinkara, the main venue of the Thiruvananthapuram Revenue district school arts festival, the boiled water available at many points on the school premises was a lifesaver.Scurrying about ferrying the water in steel jugs was a group of four National Service Scheme volunteers from Government Higher Secondary School, Marayamuttam.Geethu R., Aditya A., Harisree S. Nair, and Raji Krishna R.V., Plus One students of the school, were part of a group of 150 NSS volunteers deployed across 12 venues of the festival to implement the green protocol put in place in association with the District Suchitwa Mission.The water was boiled at the programme committee office.The girls then took the water in jugs to the various stages, and carried steel glasses too. Minutes after they left the jugs there, these would be empty, parched throats having gulped down the water.They also had the responsibility of serving tea to the judges of various events.The four were at their job all afternoon, none frazzled by the heat, courtesy their camaraderie and steady banter. The girls also kept the premises plastic-free. Such volunteers, from six schools in all, were deployed at the entrance to each venue, and their efforts made the school campus plastic-free to a large extent.
