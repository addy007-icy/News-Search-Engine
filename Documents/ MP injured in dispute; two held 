Mavelikara MP Kodikunnil Suresh sustained minor injuries after being pelted with stones reportedly when he intervened in a property dispute in which a relative of his was involved here on Sunday.Two persons, Ashokan and Geetha, were arrested in connection with the incident. According to the Museum police, the MP had reached the residence of his niece in Kanaka Nagar, near Nanthancode here, to hold discussions with her neig hbours and settle a property dispute the two parties had between them.The two parties, in fact, had both lodged complaints with the police in connection with the issue and were supposed to appear before the Museum police at 5 p.m. for talks.However, a quarrel that was on when Mr. Suresh reached the spot is believed to have escalated into fisticuffs between the accused and a few of his supporters who were with him. The accused allegedly pelted stones, one of which hit the MP on his face, causing injuries on his lips. He got himself admitted in a private hospital, while the police arrested Ashokan and Geetha.The issue later led to protests by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), who were staging a protest before the Museum police station when reports last came in.The CPI(M) had taken sides with the accused, alleging high-handedness on part of the MP and his supporters. The couple, too, have told the police that it were the supporters of the MP who began the violence.A case has been registered and an investigation is on.
