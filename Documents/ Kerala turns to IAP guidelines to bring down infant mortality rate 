The government is considering implementing the guidelines prepared by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) to address the issue of infant mortality rate (IMR) that has been stagnant at about 11 to 13 for over 10 years.In spite of the fact that over 99 per cent deliveries are institutionalised in Kerala, the State has been unable to reach the single digit target in IMR.Over 70 per cent of infant deaths occur in the first one month, and, hence, neonatal deaths have been keeping the IMR in the same bracket, even though it is a national benchmark.Senior State Health officials told The Hindu they were fine-tuning the action plan based on the guidelines provided by the IAP.Paediatricians in the State had prepared a document detailing various issues that are required to be tackled to bring down the IMR.“The issues go beyond neonatal care in the present system,” said S. Sachithananda Kamath, the national president of IAP, who had contributed to the preparation of the document, along with M.K.C. Nair, Vice Chancellor, Kerala University of Health Sciences, and other scientific programme heads under the IAP. Some of the major causes of neonatal deaths are asphyxia, infections, premature births, low birth weights, hypothermia and congenital anomalies.“While asphyxia and infections are among the problems that the infant faces because of the interaction with the new environment out of the mother’s womb, the other problems are not linked to the new environment alone, but carry a history of bad obstetrics,” said Dr. Kamath.Women’s health“Women’s health is the major issue when it comes to child bearing. Anaemia and adolescent health issues play a major role in women’s health, and child bearing capacity and infant’s health are closely linked,” he said.“A correction in these issues will provide the State the right progress to achieve the target in reducing infant deaths,” he said.The IAP has provided a protocol for neonatal care and detailed the equipments needed in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or a Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU). Neonatal resuscitation programme to deal with asphyxia, hand washing, minimal handling of babies and minimum antibiotic policy are to be followed for infection control.In premature babies, lung development would not have matured and they are more prone to respiratory diseases. They also show less reflex in sucking milk.
