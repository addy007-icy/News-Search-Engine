Continuing its drive against child labour in bangle making units of the old city, the police on Saturday arrested seven persons and rescued 79 children, including 56 aged below 12 years.While conducting a cordon and search operation in Amannagar area of old city, the south zone police found children housed in tiny dwellings and made to work for long hours. The employers were bringing children from different districts of Bihar by paying an advance of between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 15,000. A sum of Rs. 10 to Rs. 20 were paid to the children weekly.“The unit owners were selling products to traders in Begum Bazaar and making huge profits, while the children were starved and made to work for 15 hours a day. Their families back home were paid a pittance every month,” DCP (south) V. Satyanarayana said.To a question, he said that the problem is very severe in slum areas of Tallabkatta. “These are very thickly populated, and it is difficult to get information. But our officials are keeping a watch and rescuing the children,” Mr. Satyanarayana said, adding that till date the police rescued around 400 minors and registered cases against 70 persons. The children were handed over to the Women and Child Welfare Department officials, who shifted them to a children’s home. All the children will be produced before the Child Welfare Committee and sent back to their native places.
