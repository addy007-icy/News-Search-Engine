With Cheluvamba Hospital housed in a heritage structure, the expansion of the hospital has to match the existing architecture of the edifice.As space is the biggest constraint for any expansion with very little room for construction of new buildings to house new facilities/departments of the hospital, the proposed expansion of labour ward into a two-storey building will suit the heritage value of the existing building.The Public Works Department had been asked to design the proposed building in such a way that it goes well with the existing architecture of structure, thus keeping intact the combined architectural beauty of the hospital complex, said MMCRI Dean and Director B. Krishnamurthy.
