In the pre-Budget consultations with the Union Finance Minister, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has demanded a substantial increase in public investment in agriculture while farmers’ groups have asked the Centre to provide loans up to Rs. 5 lakh to all farmers at 4 per cent interest, higher support prices, increased coverage of crop insurance and adoption of a consistent export policy.BMS general secretary, Virjesh Upadhyay, said that in their suggestions, the Sangh had asked the government to address issues pertaining to profitability in agricultural and plantation sectors.“These sectors are profitable globally, but they are largely not so profitable activities in India and this issue has to be addressed,” he said.“We have urged the government to provide support prices for tea, rubber and cardamom besides other agriculture products. Also exclusive Ministries for Fisheries and Plantation should be created to boost these sectors,” he said. He said remunerative prices should be ensured for the agricultural produce.Bharat Krishak Samaj (BKS) chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar has suggested that the government do away with the interest subvention scheme on crop loans and take corrective measures to provide institutional credit to small farmers.“A CAG audit should be conducted for agriculture credit lending portfolio of public sector banks,” he said.BKS has also suggested doubling of farmers receiving loans up to Rs. 2 lakh and only 1 per cent interest be charged for these loans.
