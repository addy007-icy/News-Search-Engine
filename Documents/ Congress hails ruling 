There was all round jubilation in the Congress circles soon after the High Court gave its ruling suspending the State Government order bringing down the campaign time for the GHMC election, and making it clear that polls would be held as per the existing system.Celebrations broke out at Gandhi Bhavan, the party headquarters, with TPCC chief and the former vice-chairman of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Marri Sashidhar Reddy being congratulated for the success of their petition. Sweets were offered to the two leaders, even as other leaders and cadres raised slogans hailing the party leadership. Congress party, which has been consistently fighting what it called the ‘unethical’ methods of the TRS and the government to win the civic polls at any cost, welcomed the verdict. “This is victory of democracy and a slap on the face of the dictatorial attitude of the ruling government,” Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee President N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said on Thursday.
