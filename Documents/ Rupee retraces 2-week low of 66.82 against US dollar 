After a brief overnight calmer, the rupee once again turned shaky against the U.S. dollar and closed at 66.82, its lowest level in more than two weeks on the back of frantic demand for the American currency.Sustained capital outflows against the backdrop of sliding equities and buoyant dollar overseas largely impacted trading sentiments.Volatile currency market sentiment across Asia following a fresh round of China’s yuan depreciation further added to gloom.The home currency resumed modestly lower at 66.69 from Tuesday’s closing level of 66.60 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market.Later, it drifted sharply to hit a fresh intra-day low of 66.84 on heavy dollar demand from banks and importers amid sharp fall in the domestic equity market, before concluding at 66.82, revealing a steep loss of 22 paise, or 0.33 per cent.The local unit briefly touched a high of 66.66 during the early trade.In worldwide trade, the dollar edged higher against the other major currencies, as heightened concerns over global geopolitical tensions continued to dampen demand for riskier assets after North Korea confirmed that it had conducted a nuclear test.The dollar index, which tracks the world’s reserve currency against a basket of its peers, is up marginally by 0.03 per cent at 99.48.
