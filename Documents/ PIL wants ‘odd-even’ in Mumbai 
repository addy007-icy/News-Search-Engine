A Public Interest Litigation has been filed in the Bombay High Court seeking introduction of the odd-even rule for private cars on Mumbai roads on the lines of the pattern adopted in Delhi.The PIL has contended that the residents of the city are facing health problems due to air pollution caused by carbon monoxide emitted from vehicles and by burning and other ways of disposal of solid waste by the municipal corporation.It has said that Mumbai, which has lesser number of vehicles than Delhi, tops in vehicular emission due to congested roads, lack of space to expand because of sea coast and rising number of diesel vehicles.The plea has said Delhi implemented the odd-even traffic pattern because of poor air quality.A similar exercise should be undertaken in Mumbai also to bring down the air pollution levels, it has said.The PIL has sought a direction to the authorities to set up a committee to analyse air pollution, especially due to vehicles and other means, and to implement remedies to reduce air pollution and control it.The petition, filed by Shadaab Patel has amended that rules should be framed for sale, use and registration of diesel vehicles in the city.The respondents in the petition are Public Health Department of the state government, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and Regional Transport Office.It is expected to come up for hearing in due course.â€” PTI
