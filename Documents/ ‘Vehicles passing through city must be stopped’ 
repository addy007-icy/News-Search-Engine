: Welcoming the Delhi government’s odd-even policy to reduce pollution in the Capital, Geneva-based International Road Federation (IRF) has noted that de-congestion of roads, especially from unwanted vehicles passing through the city, is also vital to tackle the problem.Delhi’s congestion has doubled in the last eight to 10 years and threatens to fail all projections. The Capital’s congestion resulting in pollution is worst among 35 Indian cities and is four times more than Mumbai and Bangalore according to estimates released by the IRF“About 12 lakh vehicles pass through Delhi daily, clogging its nine highways especially those roads connecting Delhi with Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, Loni and Ghaziabad. This is most starkly evident on the NH-8(Delhi-Gurgaon), which was designed for peak traffic volume of 1.6 lakh vehicles by 2015.But already about 1.5 lakh vehicles fight for space on that road,” said Mr. K.K. Kapila, chairman of the IRF.The IRF noted “”an action plan is needed to decongest Delhi roads and if need be impose higher parking charges in certain areas and higher road tax on purchase of second or third vehicle by both individuals and companies.”
