Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has exhorted the beneficiaries of welfare schemes to make best use of the facilities provided by the government to become economically self-reliant.“All the welfare schemes of the government are aimed at the uplift of the poor, downtrodden and the oppressed. Our government will be the happiest if you [beneficiaries] make best use of the facilities provided to you and come up in life. I also appeal you to ensure that the facilities are not misused,” he said.Mr. Siddaramaiah was addressing a public meeting here on Saturday after distributing cheques to beneficiaries and setting in motion development programmes announced by his government at the time of the byelections to the Ballari (Rural) Assembly constituency.Taking a dig at his critics, particularly the BJP for saying that the Congress government and the Chief Minister were in deep slumber, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked “whether a sleeping government could distribute facilities, including loans, to 17,500 people on a day in a district. We are very active and have been striving hard for the welfare of the people, especially the poor, down trodden and Dalits.” Mr. Siddarmaiah expressed concern over increasing number of farm suicides in the State.“It should not happen. I have been repeatedly appealing to the farmers not to commit suicide as it was not a solution and that government will come to their rescue.”
