Banking services in the city were affected on Friday as the employees staged an agitation in response to a call by the All-India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA).Mysuru District Bank Employees’ Association (MDBEA) general secretary R. Raghavendra said the employees struck work in protest against the alleged violation of the bilateral settlement by the five associate banks of the State Bank of India (SBM, SBT, SBP, SBH and SBBJ) and their efforts to “force unilateral service conditions on employees”.While regretting the inconvenience caused to customers, Mr. Raghavendra, in a release here, said they were forced to strike because of the managements’ refusal to withdraw their action and resolve problems through mutual talks.In May 2015, a common settlement was signed between the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) Management Body and the All India Bank Employees’ Association, which defined the duties and remuneration of bank employees. A strike had been called on December 1 and 2, 2015, which was eventually called off on the intervention of the Delhi Labour Commissioner to make way for resolving the issue through mutual discussions. As the managements of associate banks are going ahead with their decision, the strike call was given, he explained.Customers inconveniencedAs many bank customers were unaware of the strike, many went to the branches only to return back to their homes. Some complained of the frequent strikes by the banking staff, causing inconvenience to customers.
