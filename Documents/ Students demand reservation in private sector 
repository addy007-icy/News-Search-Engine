Activists of the Bahujan Vidyarthi Sangha took out a march and staged a demonstration in Kalaburagi and Raichur on Thursday, demanding, among other things, reservation for backward classes in the private sector and filling backlog vacancies.In Raichur the demonstration was staged at the Tipu Sultan Garden near the office of the Deputy Commissioner.The students alleged that that the privatisation policy that gathered a momentum in early 1990s along with economic liberalisation and globalisation had snatched legitimate reservation rights from the backward and marginalised sections of society.“With successive governments aggressively implementing globalisation, liberalisation and privatisation policies, the size of public sector has dwindled to a great extent. Existing public sector units are being handed over to private players and no new public sector units are coming up. This process has negatively affected a large number of people from downtrodden sections who were just being empowered through reservations. In order to follow the path of equality and social justice enshrined in the Indian Constitution, the governments should make an appropriate policy change to ensure reservations for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in private sector as well,” Rajashekhar Kalmalkar, a sangha leader, said.The government should issue an order to provide reservation in jobs being outsourced to private agencies in the departments of Public Works, Water Resources, Excise, Forest, and Tourism, he said. The students criticised the State government for not keeping its word of filling backlog vacancies.PrivatisationThe sangha activists staged a dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Kalaburagi too and submitted a memorandum to the authorities. They took out a protest march from Jagat Circle and blocked the road raising slogans against the Union government for introducing privatisation in various sectors.Vinodkumar Srigan, district president of the sangha, said that private companies, which were set up with the facilities offered by the Union and State governments, should provide jobs to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other backward Classes.
