After smart cities, it is now the turn of villages to go smart. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday decided to implement the Centre’s National Rurban (rural and urban) mission in 99 tehsils of the state’s 28 districts.The mission is aimed at ending the disparity between the rural and urban development by providing financial and technical facilities and creating job opportunities. The mission will implement Centre and State schemes in a planned and designated timeframe.As per the Centre’s guidelines, the State has been divided into tribal and non-tribal categories while selecting areas to be included in this mission. The State has chosen 49 tehsils from 11 tribal districts, while 50 tehsils from 18 non-tribal districts. Parameters used while selecting tehsils include population growth in the last decade, increased number of employment opportunities in non-agri sector, financial institutions in the district, important tourist and pilgrim spots and proximity to transport facilities.Neighbouring villages, with approximately 25,000 to 50,000 population in the coastal or plain areas, and 5,000 to 15,000 in tribal or hilly areas, will be selected for the smart cluster scheme. The State will also consider factors such as increased land prices and the enrolment of girl children in secondary schools.The mission primarily aims at developing clusters on the basis of agriculture and related units. It also includes setting up skill development programmes, mobile health unit, tap water scheme, solid and liquid waste management, building gutters, LPG connections, digital literacy, public transport and civic service centres.State’s Rural Development department will coordinate the mission and a high-level committee chaired by the chief secretary will look after the implementation work. Apart from State-level committees, there will be committees at the district and cluster level.State’s Rural Development minister Pankaja Munde said: “This mission is to ensure development of tribal and non-tribal rural areas.”
