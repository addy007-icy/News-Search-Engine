The work on the Pannikkuzhy culvert near Thiruvalla on the MC Road is yet to be completed even 16 months after commencement of the work.The work on the culvert was launched by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on September 14, 2014. Mr. Chandy had then said the work would be completed in eight months so as to ease traffic congestion on the stretch.The promises made by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, and the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) authorities have been proved hollow, said P.D. George, Thiruvalla Vigilance Council, president. Heavy traffic congestion on the Muthoor-Perunthuruthy has been a regular feature for the past one year.Expertsâ€™ doubtsMany civil engineering experts have expressed doubts about the strength of the protection walls of the approach roads to the culvert on either side. They say the three-to-seven-foot-tall protection wall in rubble masonry appears to be weak. The rubble has started protruding from the centre of the protection wall, posing danger to vehicles plying on the road, Mr. George said.Following strong public protests and intervention from higher-ups, the KSTP authorities had promised completion of the culvert by October 30, 2014. That deadline too was not met. The agency could not complete the work ahead of the Sabarimala pilgrim season too, inconveniencing devotees.Though the KSTP attempted to open the bridge for single-line traffic on December 23, it was closed in the next few hours itself following reports of the sinking of a portion of the road while a truck passed by the bridge.Meanwhile, a group of agitated people forcefully opened the bridge for vehicular traffic on Thursday, disregarding the work on the approach roads.
