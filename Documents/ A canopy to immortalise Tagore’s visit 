Just as you are on the way to the Glass House from the hillock at Lalbagh, you will notice a canopy of Java fig trees.It was under the leadership of German horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel that the saplings of these trees and seeds were imported from Indonesia by the Mysore Horticultural Society. In the 1920s, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore visited Lalbagh to address schoolchildren. “Tagore loved the experience of being amid trees. The aesthetic canopy of a dozen Java fig trees was Krumbiegel’s gesture to immortalise Tagore’s visit to Lalbagh,” said S. Narayana Swamy, who has written a book on Krumbiegel.
