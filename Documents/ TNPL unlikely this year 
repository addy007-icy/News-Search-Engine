“There is no way a Twenty20 event, which some are already calling Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), can be held this year. It’s just not realistically possible this year,” a top Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) source emphatically told The Hindu here on Wednesday.Speculation had been doing the rounds that with CSK out of the IPL for the next two years, the TNCA would, from this season, start a State Twenty20 competition with franchises from different districts on the lines of the Karnataka Premier League.Giving his reasons for the competition not taking off this year, the source said, “Firstly, it will be late March when the first division league gets over. We cannot, then, have the tournament during IPL because five to six marquee cricketers from the State would be representing the different franchises.”He added, “Later, we have a string of competitions such as the Buchi Babu before preparations start for the next Ranji season.“Where is the time to plan and host such an event at different centres?”
