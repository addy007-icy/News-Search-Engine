: YSR Congress chief Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Thursday took strong objection to the arrest of party MP P.V. Midhun Reddy and MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy “on trumped up charges to wreak political vengeance.”“An Emergency-like situation” prevailed in the State as the Chandrababu Naidu government was all out to foist cases on YSRC lawmakers to create a “fear psychosis,” he claimed.Mr. Jagan was speaking after calling on the Rajampet MP and the Chandragiri MLA, who were lodged in Central Sub Jail near Venkatachalam in Nellore district.Referring to the arrest of the party MP from Rajampet in connection with an altercation with an Air India official in November last at Renigunta Airport in Chittoor district, he dared the government to make public the CCTV footage on the incident.Instead of honouring the Chandragiri MLA for leading the Samaikyandhra movement, the government choose to arrest him stir, he said.The government was trying to reopen old cases against YSRC leaders with an ulterior political motive to demoralise them, he contended.People were watching the misdeeds and would teach a lesson to the Telugu Desam Party, he asserted.Instead of keeping the poll promise to create one crore jobs, the State government was throwing out contract workers on one pretext or the other.He also promised to raise the issue during the budget session of the State legislature.
