After protests from the Congress party, the Bihar government’s official website on Monday removed lines which referred to former prime minister Indira Gandhi’s regime as “worse than the British rule”. The Congress party is a coalition partner in the ruling alliance with the JD(U) and RJD and the party leaders objected strongly to the content in the government’s official website under “History of Bihar” section.The paragraph on the website read: “It was he (Jay Prakash Narayan) who steadfastly and staunchly opposed the autocratic rule of Indira Gandhi and her younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.Fearing people’s reaction to his opposition, Indira Gandhi had him arrested on the eve of declaring National Emergency beginning June 26, 1975. He was put in the Tihar Jail, located near Delhi, where notorious criminals are jailed. Thus, in Free India, this septuagenarian, who had fought for India’s freedom alongside Indira Gandhi’s father, Jawahar Lal Nehru, received a treatment that was worse than what the British had meted out to Gandhiji in Champaran in 1917, for his speaking out against oppression.”“The reference to our party leader Indira Gandhi in a government’s official website was unacceptable and we informed our top party leaders to take up the issue with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar,” said State Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra. The Bihar Congress president Ashok Choudhary, who is the State Education Minister also said the party was proud of Indira Gandhi and they would take up the issue with Mr KumarHowever, on Monday morning the controversial reference was missing from the paragraph.The paragraph now reads: “JP’s substantial contribution to modern Indian history continued up until his death in 1979. It was he who led a movement that led to massive win of a non-Congress government —The Janata Party — at Delhi, for the first time.”
