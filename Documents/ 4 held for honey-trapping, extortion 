A gang that lured unsuspecting men and extorted money from them by threatening to file fake rape complaints has been busted, the police said on Thursday.The gang comprised six persons, including two women.The women would allegedly lure the victims to establish physical relations with them. The rest of the gang would then photograph the victims in a compromising position and blackmail them.The racket came to light on Monday evening, when a man filed a complaint at Jagat Puri police station in East Delhi.A woman contacted the victim on his mobile phone a few weeks and she went on to befriend him. The woman soon proposed that they meet at a traffic signal in Jagat Puri, from where she took him to a flat in nearby Ram Nagar, where they got intimate. Just as the man was about to put on his clothes, a woman and three men claiming to be police officers barged inside.They photographed the victim in the nude along with the woman, who immediately joined her associates. The victim was thrashed and ordered to shell out Rs.3 lakh, failing which he was threatened with a fake rape complaint.“He managed to escape by paying up Rs.50,000. However, they kept his car and told him to return with another Rs.50,000,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) B.S. Gurjar.Instead of going back, the victim rushed to a nearby police station to file a complaint. A case was registered and a team constituted to nab the suspects.The victim was asked to pretend as if he wanted to pay the rest of the amount. That helped the police nab one of the suspects, Amarjeet Singh. At his instance, his three associates, including two women, were nabbed, while the rest are on the run.They have reportedly confessed to extorting money using the same modus operandi from other victims too. The police have recovered a pistol, cartridges and a baseball bat used to intimidate and thrash the victim.
