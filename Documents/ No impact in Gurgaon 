The first day of the odd-even formula in Delhi had little impact in Gurgaon with most companies, especially IT firms, closed on account of Friday being New Year’s Day.HUDA City Centre metro station, which records more than 1.5 lakh footfall every day, had less than usual crowd. “Usually the queues extend till the entry gates on both sides of the metro station from 8a.m-10a.m.sBut the usual hustle-bustle is missing on account of New Year’s Day,” said Mohan Singh, a private security guard deployed at the station. Inspector Rajender Singh, Central Industrial Security Force, said that extra deployment was made in anticipation of a rush.“We were expecting more than usual crowd because of odd-even policy in Delhi and had deployed extra staff for frisking. But there was little crowd today. We expect the numbers to rise on Monday,” said Mr. Singh.
