Coimbatore Consumer Cause has written to the Director of Town and Country Planning to reject a resolution the Corporation had passed at its Urgent Council meeting on December 22.JudgmentThe resolution recommended conversion of a reserve site (public purpose site – children’s playground) to residential site. Quoting a Madras High Court judgment of April 12, 2007, the consumer body said that the court had held illegal such conversion and emphasised that sites reserved for a particular purpose should not be used for any other purpose.The consumer body had pointed out to the Director that the Supreme Court that heard an appeal against the Madras High Court judgment in this regard summarily dismissed the petition. Based on the direction of the Madras High Court, the State Government advised officers concerned to not allow conversion of sites earmarked for public purpose.OrdersTo date the Government had not issued orders to permit de-reservation of such sites, it said and added that subsequent orders the Government had passed only confirmed its earlier stances.This being the case, it failed to understand how the Corporation had passed a resolution which was contrary to rules and court orders, the consumer body said.
