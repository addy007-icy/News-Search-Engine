With increasing incidents of misuse of railway concession in fare for senior citizens, the Railway Board has decided to levy penalty on those under-aged persons misusing the concession and treat those who corner the lower berths reserved under senior citizen quota as travelling without ticket.A railway official said that in the current system, the railway was treating aged persons very leniently.“We used to collect only the difference amount between the concessional fare and non-concessional fare from people who fail to produce the proof of age (60 years for men and 58 years for women). However, many started misusing this,” he said.These under-aged people used to take a risk of taking tickets at concessional fare. Though they are made to pay the difference in fare, many a time they go scot-free in the absence of travelling ticket examiner’s checking.“Since there was no penalty imposed on violators to deter misuse, it resulted in more incidents of misuse of the concessional facility resulting in revenue loss to railways,” the officer said.Moreover, many such people were also managing to get lower berths, reserved for senior citizens, by false declaration of age.“By doing this, these people deny genuine senior citizens the chance of getting lower berths,” the official added.Such people who misuse the senior citizens quota would be treated as travelling without ticket and penalised accordingly.The new rule would come into effect on February 1, 2016.
