A team from the Indian Heritage Cities Network (IHCN) is in Vijayapura city to prepare a detailed project report on the restoration of ancient subterranean tunnels here for promoting tourism, Deputy Commissioner D. Randeep has said.Speaking at a ‘Clean monument’ campaign organised by the district chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) near the ‘Landa Kasab’ cannon of the Adil Shahi era here on Friday, he said that the agency had been hired for preparing a broad plan on restoring the ancient water system. Mr. Randeep said that the district administration would take up the matter with the government after receiving the report.The official said that the government was expected to grant approval for a tourism plaza in the city within a week. Mr. Randeep said that of the Rs. 10 crore granted by the government in the State Budget for tourism development in the city, at least Rs. 3 crore would be released in a few days. Earlier, Krishna Kolhar Kulkarni, convener of INTACH’s district unit, said that the campaign had been organised to educate people about the importance of monuments. He said that Bijapur had around 92 watch towers during the Adil Shahi era and 87 huge cannons to protect the city from invaders.“It is surprising that all those cannons were manufactured in Bijapur city itself. It means that the city had iron factories and the technology to design such cannons,” he said.Mr. Kulkarni said that ‘Landa Kasab’ meant neck-cutter. “It is one of the biggest cannons manufactured during the rule of Ali Adil Shah between 1552 and 1580. It weights around 47 tonnes. It is 21.5 ft long and has a diameter of 4.5 ft,” he said.Assistant Conservator of ASI’s Dharwad circle, Anandateertha and activist Peter Alexander were present.
