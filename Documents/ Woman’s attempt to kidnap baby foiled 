The police on Saturday arrested a 35-year-old woman for allegedly trying to kidnap a four-month-old baby boy from the government-run Rajawadi Hospital.The woman was caught after patrolling policemen saw the baby’s mother chasing an autorickshaw on foot and stopped to investigate, after which the matter came to light.According to the Tilak Nagar police, the incident occurred at 7:00 am on Saturday. The police said that Shakuntala Kanaujia (30), a resident of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar in Ghatkopar, had taken her four-month-old son to the Rajawadi Hospital for a routine check up.While she was waiting in a queue, her son had to be taken to the toilet.While she was changing her son’s clothes, the accused woman, later identified as Khalikunissa Khan (35), approached her and offered to help.Modus operandi“Khan engaged Kanaujia in a conversation while helping her take care of her son,” said Senior Police Inspector Bhagwat Sonawane, Tilak Nagar police station.“Soon, Khan took the baby in her arms. When Kanuajia turned away to check the status of the queue outside the doctor’s cabin, Khan slipped out of the hospital with the boy and hailed an autorickshaw.”As son as Kanaujia realised that Khan and her son were missing, she rushed out of the hospital just in time to see Khan getting into an auto.She gave chase on foot, shouting for help, and managed to catch up with the auto, which was meandering through the heavy traffic jam at the junction.At the same time, some police personnel in a patrolling vehicle of the Tilak Nagar police, which was passing by saw Kanaujia running after the auto on foot and stopped to investigate. Both the women and the boy were taken to the police station, and after inquiries, Khan was placed under arrest and charged with kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code, the police said.“Khan has claimed she kidnapped the boy because she does not have a child of her own. However, the ease and speed with which she managed to slip away with the boy suggests she might have committed similar crimes in the past, and we are making inquiries to this end,” Mr Sonawane said.Targetting childrenPolice officials said civic-run hospitals, railway stations and crowded market places are the places of choice for child kidnappers, and such gangs always include at least one woman. The woman’s role is either to win the confidence of the intended target’s parents, or to simply walk away with an unattended child, as a child in a woman’s arms tends to attract less suspicion in a crowded place.The accused offered to help the mother to change the boy's clothes before slipping away
