Another couple have come forward claiming that the hearing-speech impaired woman Geeta, who returned from Pakistan last October after accidentally landing in that country is their daughter.“Ranjeet Singh and his wife Maya petitioned us on Thursday [seeking permission to meet her] saying Geeta was their daughter who got lost when they were travelling 27 years ago,” a senior district official said.The application was being examined before being sent to the Centre which will decide whether to allow the Bhopal-based couple to meet Geeta, the official said. According to him, the district authorities have so far received five applications from people claiming that Geeta was their daughter.Last month, Aneesa Bi, a 40-year-old woman from Jabalpur district, had claimed that she was her long-lost daughter, Najjo. However, Geeta didn’t recognise her from the photograph.In November, a family from Bihar had claimed that Geeta’s real name was Heera Mahato. However, the DNA test did not support its claim.Before that, she had refused to recognise a couple from Uttar Pradesh.Geeta is now staying at an institution for the hearing-impaired people.She was reportedly seven or eight when she was found sitting alone on the Samjhauta Express by the Pakistan Rangers at Lahore railway station 15 years ago. She was then adopted by Edhi Foundation.
