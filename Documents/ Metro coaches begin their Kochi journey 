Providing a major leap to urban mass transport in greater-Kochi region, the first set of three coaches for Kochi Metro began their 10-day road journey to Kochi from Alstom’s manufacturing unit in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, on Saturday.They were flagged off by Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu. The huge trailer lorries bearing the coaches will arrive here on January 12.Both Mr. Naidu and Kerala’s Minister for Power and Railways Aryadan Mohammed cited the ‘ahead-of-schedule delivery’ as a major achievement. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) claimed that the delivery of the first batch is five months ahead of schedule after orders were placed in August 2014.There was delay in finalising tenders since Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and KMRL were on different pages on matters like coach width and retendering. Principal Advisor to DMRC E. Sreedharan, its MD Mangu Singh, KMRL’s MD Elias George, K.V. Thomas, MP and Hibi Eden, MLA, were among those present at the flagging off ceremony.‘Depot on track’Reacting to concerns of ‘delay’ in completing civil and related works at the metro’s coach depot in Muttom to conduct trial runs, DMRC sources said that the depot is ready to receive the first batch of coaches and for their test runs.“The ramp to take the train to the viaduct will be ready as scheduled by February end. There is adequate manpower and the pace of works has increased during the working season since rain has taken a break,” they said.
