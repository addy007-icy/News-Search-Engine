A post-mortem on Subhash, who committed suicide hours after being released from the custody of Maradu police in Kochi, has revealed that he suffered torture.As per the autopsy report, the victim sustained injuries on his body, including the one from suspension of the body while hanging.It attributed infiltration of blood, found on either sides of neck, to pressure exerted by finger tips.The report of the post-mortem, performed at Alappuzha Medical College Hospital, also pointed at four blunt injuries in the victimâ€™s right arm, which could have been caused due to forcible gripping of the arm by the hand. Besides, he had also sustained blunt injuries in stomach, chest and left side of the hip.While the report categorically states that the blunt injuries and infiltration of blood were not sufficient to cause death, it debunks the police version that Subhash was not subjected to torture under custody.Subash was found hanging from the ceiling of his bedroom by his wife on Sunday morning. In a complaint filed with Bijo Alexander, Deputy Police Superintendent, Thrikkakara, relatives of the victim alleged that Subash had been suffering from depression after being assaulted in public by P.R. Santhosh, former Sub-Inspector at the station.The State Police Complaints Authority has also taken cognizance of the incident.Following the raging protest against the officer, he was transferred from the station. Besides holding a protest march, the local residents of Maradu had resorted to a poster campaign against the officer.
