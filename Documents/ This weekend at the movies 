A guide to all the movies that released this weekend. Read the reviews and take your pick!Tharai Thapattai: Warmed-over Bala, but still worthwhile I watched Thaarai Thappattai like I watch all Bala’s films — partly exasperated, but also (for the most part) able to brush aside the annoyances because he’s such a singular creator. Foremost among my issues with this director: the jagged cutaways, the oddly spliced in reaction shots, the painfully one-note villains, the utter lack of finesse.

Dhanush’s name has been thrown up often. Simbu’s name has come up too. But there may well be an underdog slowly sneaking up on them. And he can even dance.

The most intriguing aspect of The Danish Girl is that it is much more about that love story than it is about Lili’s road to self-discovery.

Gethu is one such. It all assumes drastically worse proportions when you realise that there really is no place for a heroine in the story, but Nandini comes and goes anyway. >More....******** >Kathakali: A fairly watchable thriller It’s shot well. It moves briskly. There’s a nice “mass” touch involving a selfie. Some thought has gone in. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but we are at a stage with these star vehicles where “some thought has gone in” and “not bad” are active recommendations. >More...******** >Chalk and Duster: Lessons in moral science The most amazing thing about Chalk N Duster is how it manages to put together a stalwart cast for the tiny film that it is. This set of seasoned actors is also the only reason why the film turns out to be more watchable than it should be. Full review >here. >
