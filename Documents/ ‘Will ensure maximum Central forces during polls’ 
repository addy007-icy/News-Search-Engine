Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said he would ensure that maximum number of central forces are deployed in the State during the Assembly polls.“As country’s Home Minister, I want to assure the entire people of Bengal, cast your votes fearlessly in this Assembly polls. I will tell the Election Commission, whatever central forces may be required, we will provide all of that,” Mr Singh said at a party here in North 24 Parganas district.The Home Minister pointed out that people of the State aspire to bring change but express helplessness as polling booths are captured during the polls."You have given us power in Parliament and now it is time to give us power in the Assembly. I assure you we will do whatever it takes to change the fortune of Bengal,” he added.The Home Minister’s remark of deploying maximum number of central forces was met with criticism by the ruling Trinamool Congress. TMC MP and party’s leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay called the remarks “ unconstitutional”.“He can not announce a policy decision (regarding deployment of Central forces during Assembly polls) from a party rally. Such decisions are taken after a discussion between the Home Ministry and the Election Commission along with negotiations with the State government concerned,” Mr Bandyopadhyay said.
