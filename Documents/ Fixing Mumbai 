The new year is still somewhat fresh; the hope with which we look ahead to fresh starts has not been more than mildly bruised. A good time, we thought, to take a look at the many problems that get in this city’s — and its citizens’ — way. In keeping with that optimistic spirit, we decided that we needed to not just point at shortcomings but find ways to make things better. To do this, we turned to some of the best minds in Mumbai, unquestioned authorities in their fields and, as important, people with a deep connection to the city and an affection for it, and asked them one question: looking through the lens of your domain expertise, what’s wrong with Mumbai, and how would you fix it?Over the coming weeks, we will carry those answers in the Sunday pages of the newspaper. They will over a wide range of topics, as befits a huge and complex city, and feature the thoughts of people we all know and respect (or should). We hope that this series will encourage introspection and debate, with you, our Mumbai readers, with other experts, with the people who have the power and the means to effect change.What do you think needs fixing?It’s not just about what we think matters. We also want to hear from you, our fellow citizens of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, on what you think needs fixed and the experts you want to hear from. We're listening, here, and on social media: @Mumbai_Connect on Twitter or facebook.com/TheHinduMumbai/What's your Mumbai Fix?While we do have a strong list of experts have contributed and will do so in the future, perhaps you have ideas that are even better? To suggest a fix, write to us at fixing.mumbai@thehindu.co.in with a short (not more than 50 words) statement of the problem and a longer (but not too long: a maximum of 200 words) description of your innovative solution for that problem.Bring back the joy of givingMuch of Mumbai was built by philanthropists.
