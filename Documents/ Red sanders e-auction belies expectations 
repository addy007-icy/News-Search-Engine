The fourth phase of the e-tender-cum-e-auction of red sanders, which lasted for three days from January 12 to January 14, turned out to be damp squib, as it failed to meet the government’s expectation of earning a minimum of Rs. 1,000 crore in revenue.Senior forest officials attributed the poor response to the economic slowdown in China, which, they said, had prevented the country from shelling out its foreign capital. Also, the Chinese government has apparently taken a serious view of the arrests of its nationals by Chittoor and Kadapa police on charges of red sanders smuggling in recent months.Incidentally, the government had readied 2,868 metric tonnes (MTs) of red sanders logs for e-auctioning for Phase-IV through MSTC Ltd., a Central government enterprise, after issuing a tender notification through the forest wing.Prior to the process, prospective bidders, including those from China, were allowed to inspect various grades of red sanders at the godowns near Tirupati till January 11.Going by international market trends, the government had expected a minimum of Rs. 1,000 crore in the current phase of auctioning, after receiving a shot in its arm thanks to versions of police and forest intelligence, projecting the value of the precious wood at Rs. 1.25 crore for each metric tonne in China.After the formation of the Red Sanders Anti-smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) by the State government in February 2015, as many as 10 Chinese nationals were arrested between May and December, 2015, in various States, including Telangana, New Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The State police had even executed daring operations on the Indo-Bhutanese border, seizing logs worth several crores of rupees.A senior police officer told The Hindu that an interaction with some Chinese bidders who had come to inspect the logs meant for e-auction led to important revelations.According to DGFT (Director-General of Foreign Trade) guidelines, the State government can export 8,584 tonnes of red sanders in log form.The third phase in October 2015 was dropped in view of “poor response” and “incredibly low quotation” by bidders, which also led to reports of the alleged formation of syndicate by red sanders smugglers.Economic slowdown in China to blame; AP’s expectation of Rs. 1,000 crore watered down
