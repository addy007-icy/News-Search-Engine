Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) working president and Madhira MLA Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Monday alleged that the TRS government was resorting to repressive measures against aggrieved farmers and toiling masses in a bid to suppress their voice.He was speaking at a protest organised by the farmers near the sub-jail in Madhira town. The agitated farmers organised the protest resenting the alleged foisting of cases against three farmers of Bheemavaram village in Yerrupalem mandal for raising their voice against “erratic power supply” a couple of weeks ago.Addressing the farmers, Mr Vikramarka alleged that the TRS government had earned the notoriety of implementing “anti-farmer” and “anti-worker” policies. People would teach a fitting lesson to the "dictatorial regime" at an appropriate time, he said.TPCC Kisan Cell president M Kodanda Reddy and others spoke.
