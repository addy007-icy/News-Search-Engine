A modified version of the Aam Aadmi Party-initiated (AAP) odd-even vehicle rationing scheme is on the cards – but not just yet, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced here on Sunday. Speaking at a function organised, on his behalf, to express the government’s gratitude to the citizens of the Capital for making the scheme ‘a grand success’, the Chief Minster said the second phase of the experiment would be ‘implemented soon’ but after ‘necessary precautions and changes’ were made to the regulations.
