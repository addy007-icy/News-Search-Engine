The BJP is likely to field former Congress MLA Narayan Tripathi, who joined the ruling party during 2014 Lok Sabha polls, for the coming Maihar Assembly by-election. The by-poll will take place on Feb. 13.“Although official announcement will be made by the party’s election committee soon, we all are of the opinion that Mr Tripathi should be BJP’s candidate from Maihar as he has joined the party after resigning as a Congress legislator for strengthening BJP during last Lok Sabha elections,” state BJP chief Nandkumar Singh Chouhan told reporters.Replying to a query on why those who had defected from other parties would be given ticket instead of hardcore party workers, Mr Chouhan said that “in order to spread its wings, BJP has to encompass all those who are capable in its fold.” -- PTI
