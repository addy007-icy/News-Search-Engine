The Travancore Devaswom Board has constructed three check-dams in the Njunangar stream leading to the Pampa as part of the direct river treatment system mooted by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB).PCB Environmental Engineer Paulus Eapen told The Hindu that direct river treatment was badly needed in the wake of the unabated flow of highly hazardous sewage into the Pampa from Sabarimala Sannidhanam through the Njunangar stream.He said the PCB had been monitoring the status of the Pampa pollution on a daily basis and the e-coli count was recorded at 1,20,000 in 100 ml of water in the Njunangar and 90,000 in the downstream reaches of the Pampa as on Thursday.This was against the maximum permissible limit of 500 per 100 ml for bathing purpose, he added.Pampa pollutionVarious studies too found that the filth flowing through Njunangar was a major cause of pollution of the Pampa.Mr. Eapen said the direct river treatment system comprise three compartments made in the Njunangar by constructing three temporary check-dams at Cheriyanavattom.Continuous aeration of river water was done in the first compartment.The overflowing water is detained in the second bund for settling and the sludge accumulated would be pumped out to the nearby forest periodically.The overflow from this second compartment would be detained in the third compartment and this would be once again aerated for improving the dissolved oxygen concentration before releasing into the downstream of the Pampa, Mr. Eapen said.The PCB had not recommended use of any chemical coagulants for direct river treatment, he said.Treatment needed in the wake of flow of hazardous sewage into the Pampa from Sabarimala.
