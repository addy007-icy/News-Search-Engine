The cash-starved Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has once again been accused of wasteful expenditure. This time for shelling out consultancy fees even for minor projects.According to former councillor S. Harish, the BBMP has been hiring consultants for the construction of a compound wall, a prayer hall (bhajan mandir), old-age home and even its own office in one of the wards.“Do these works warrant a consultant? Why should the BBMP entrust the monitoring of such projects to consultants? Doesn’t this mean that the civic body thinks its engineers are incapable of taking up and monitoring civil works?” he said, and claimed that the civic body is spending nearly Rs. 30 crore every year on consultants.A circular was issued last year by BBMP Commissioner G. Kumar Naik states that works estimated to be over Rs. 10 lakh have to be monitored by a consultant/agency as part of third-party inspections and monitoring, an official said.Officials defended the move stating that the civic body is only hiring consultants for PMC (project monitoring and control) to ensure quality and for audit purposes. A senior official told The Hindu that the circular was issued to check misappropriation of funds.Storm water drainsQuestions have been raised about why the BBMP is hiring consultants for remodelling primary and secondary valleys and drains.“Funds were released for the work under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) after the BBMP submitted the master plan and detailed project reports (DPR). Why couldn’t the same be used to execute the work,” asked S. Harish, former councillor.Defending the move to hire consultants, H.C. Ananthaswamy, BBMP’s chief engineer, storm water drains, said that the master plan was formulated in 2001. “A lot has changed since then. A comprehensive survey of the drain network and the encroachments has been carried out. We had to update the master plan. The consultants are aiding the BBMP with the PMC for the approved works,” he said.He said that, with the updated master plan, the civic body could approach any development agency seeking the Rs. 6,500 crore required for comprehensive improvement of the drain network and the four valleys in the city.
