R. Ashok, senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister, has accused the Congress government of making attempts to postpone the elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats till the presentation of the State Budget.He told presspersons here on Tuesday that the government was committing mistakes over reservation of constituencies and getting writ petitions filed in the court through its own leaders to get the elections postponed so that it could go to the polls after announcing pro-peoples programmes in the budget. He said that the BJP was opposed to these moves and urged the government to hold the election as scheduled.Mr. Ashok criticised the government for its failure to tackle drought. He said that government was taking hefty amounts as loan and passing on the burden to the people. “The State is on the verge of bankruptcy. The government has not been releasing compensation to the kin of the farmers who had committed suicide. Even Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa himself had said that the government was ‘drowsing’ which itself indicated the way government was functioning,” Mr. Ashok said.FailuresHe said that the BJP would fight the election while exposing the government’s failures and would not seek alliance with other parties. “This election is of party workers and it is the responsibility of the party leaders to ensure their victory,” he added. Karadi Sanganna, MP, and BJP district unit president Nemiraj Naik were present.
