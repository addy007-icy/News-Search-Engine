Actions devoidof reasonIn a civilised society reason plays a vital role. When human actions are devoid of reason, things become odd and confusing. The incidents of cockfights and jallikattu organised at different parts of the State as part of Sankranti festival are frightening. We should recall Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore’s line “… Let my country awake where clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit…” It is unfortunate that his prayer has remained confined to books.Y. Dilleswara RaoMangapuram ColonyHonouringCourt ordersIt is unfortunate that cockfights and jallikattu took place in the State in presence and with encouragement of law makers in open defiance of the Supreme Court orders. It is high time that both the State and the Central governments wake up and punish the guilty irrespective of the status of the persons involved. If the governments keep mum then the President must intervene and counsel good sense in them.Ganti Mahapatruni Rama RaoPithapuram ColonyImportance to citizensThe commitment of Japanese government to its citizens is worth emulating. It has been running a train service for a single school going passenger for years. While copying Japan in all round development we should also learn from Japan on how to respect people’s demands. The government has been ignoring the people’s opposition to the proposed nuclear power project at Kovvada in Srikakulam district and going ahead with the project.A.V.R.K. MurtySeetammadharaHassle-free IFRPeople of the city are fortunate to get the opportunity to witness the International Fleet Review . Giving passes on the basis of Aadhaar cards is not a solution to restrict the numbers nor for security reasons. Let the space provided for VIPs be as minimum as possible and let remaining space be allowed for general public . Motorised vehicles should be allowed up to a certain time to drop the visitors with no need for a long walk. Also let the authorities permit people to sit on the sand on the beach as long as it doesn’t pose a security problem.Prithvi KoneruMVP ColonyStudent’s life is importantThe recent suicide by a research scholar of the University of Hyderabad due to harsh discriminatory treatment meted out to him by the university administration caught the attention of the nation. The parties trying to get political mileage from the death of a student is reprehensible. It is time for politicians to act rationally in the interests of our country as a whole.K.M.
