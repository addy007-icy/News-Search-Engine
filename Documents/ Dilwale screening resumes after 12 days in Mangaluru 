Cinemas in Mangaluru began to screen the Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol starrer Dilwale from Friday, which was stalled following protests by Bajrang Dal-Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists in Dakshina Kannada since December 20.As the district administration and the city police did not ensure screening of the movie, social activist Vidya Dinker filed a police complaint with Mangaluru South police demanding protection for screening of the movie. She had also written to Home Minister G. Parameshwara to restore rule of law in Dakshina Kannada.City Police Commissioner S. Murugan, who had been stating that the police were prepared to extend protection to cinemas, got the security offered from December 25 onwards. However, cinemas were wary of screening the movie.From Friday, the three multiplexes in Mangaluru — PVR Cinemas, Cinepolis and Big Cinemas — commenced screening of the movie. One of the operators said the afternoon shows had seen about 75 per cent occupancy, while another said the response would be known from Saturday, the weekend. The Karnataka Reserve Police Forces has been deployed near these multiplexes.Meanwhile, VHP Dakshina Kannada president Jagadish Shenava said it was because of the VHP-Bajrang Dal protest that the screening of the movie had been halted in Mangaluru. He reiterated that the protest was against Mr. Khan’s statement that there was growing intolerance in India. They would appeal to people not to watch the movie and there would not be any more protests, he added.
