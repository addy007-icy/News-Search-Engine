: Amid rampant concretisation and booming real estate in Ghaziabad, the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday stayed construction on green belts in the satellite city.The tribunal passed the order when Society for Protection of Environment and Biodiversity (SPENBIO) urged for a stay on construction of the City Club by the Ghaziabad Development Authority and allotment of shops on a green belt in Raj Nagar District Centre (RDC).The NGO has been highlighting the deplorable condition of green belts across Ghaziabad.According to SPENBIO, green spaces are covered in sewage, industrial waste, trees felled illegally, and municipal waste that is set on fire.Shops and clubs seemed to have replaced trees, while the Hindon river is flooded with sewage.â€” Staff Reporter
