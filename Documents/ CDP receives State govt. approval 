The master plan for the Mysuru-Nanjangund Local Planning Area- 2031, also called the City Development Plan (CDP), has finally been approved by the government.This was announced by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) chairman K.R. Mohan Kumar here on Thursday. Mr. Kumar said that the approved plan will pave way for orderly development of the city.The previous CDP expired in 2011 and development was stalled in the absence of a plan since then. The master plan is valid till 2031 with provisions for minor modifications to set right slight anomalies.It is expected to be gazetted by the State government in a day or two. The draft plan, prepared during the previous BJP regime, was released almost four years ago.However, it was not notified by the successive Congress government as the plan was criticised as being faulty and favourable to real estate sharks.Even Chief Minister Siddaramaiah wanted the plan to be scrapped.But after discussions and debates, involving the Law Department and senior officials of the Urban Development Department and Director, Country and Town Planning, the State government realised that it could not backtrack on notifying the plan.Once the CDP, which runs into nearly three volumes is gazette notified, it will be uploaded on the website, said Mr. Kumar, who welcomed the development saying that MUDA could now conceive new projects with the CDP as a guiding factor.“The plan has been conceived bearing in mind the projected population of Mysuru and the Local Planning Area — which includes Nanjangud and Srirangapatana — to be around 24 lakh by 2031 … all facilities and new infrastructure will have to cater to this population,” the MUDA chairman said.In the absence of a master plan, MUDA was handicapped, as zoning regulations were not clear and many of the projects were stalled. The worst affected were the housing cooperative societies as no fresh projects were receiving MUDA approval. However, NGOs like the Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) had faulted the plan document on the grounds that the exercise did not involve local stakeholders and was based on faulty data.MGP also questioned the projected population and hence wanted the planning exercise to be started afresh.The Master Plan for Mysuru-Nanjangud Local Planning Area-2031 envisages a population of the region to be around 19,09,000 by 2021 and 23,77,000 by 2031 as against 13,25,650, when the exercise commenced in 2011. There is no change in the size of the Local Planning Area (LPA) which remains at 507 sq. k.m. and includes 118 villages that comes under the jurisdiction of the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA).As per the plan document, the LPA has 50,708.30 hectares of which 33,095.57 hectares is identified for urban planning usage. The plan document has notified 16,123 hectares as agricultural zone, while 308.28 hectares has been notified as special agricultural zone and 715.39 hectares as water bodies. Of 33,095.57 hectares notified for urban planning, 17.052.17 hectares has been earmarked for residential areas, 871.83 hectares for commercial usage, 2,481.29 hectares for industrial usage. The land usage for parks and open places is 2,435.61 hectares and 763.55 hectares is notified as forests.MUDA’s proposed facilities for solid waste management, sewage treatment plant and water supply will be based on the future projected population of the city.Development in the city was stalled as the previous City Development Plan expired in 2011
