Free internet services have finally arrived at Delhi’s mass rapid transit system - the Metro. Commuters of the Delhi Metro received a pleasant surprise on the first day of the New Year as free-wi-fi services were launched at two of the city’s busiest stations - Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate.Christened as “Metro-Fi”, the new facility will let passengers surf the internet free of cost for half-an-hour on a daily basis. For browsing beyond the first 30 minutes through wi-fi, the commuter will be charged as per the rates of the service provider, payment for which can be done through online transactions. Until recently, only trains and stations on the 5.1 km long Rapid Metro Network in Gurgaon were wi-fi enabled. Passengers have all the more reasons to cheer as the facility is going to be made available at three more stations. These stations include Vishwavidyalaya, Central Secretariat and Hauz Khas.Explaining the procedure, a senior official of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said, “As soon as a passenger enters the platform/concourse area of the station after entering trough token or smart card, he/she can search available wi-fi network named “Metro-Fi”. Once this network is selected, the web page of Metro-Fi will appear on the mobile phone/laptop screen and system will ask for the registration using the mobile number” “As soon as the mobile number is entered, a SMS will be received on the mobile number through SMS gateway having login password. After receiving the above password, you need to again select the ‘Metro-Fi’ network, on the web page select option, “Already Registered” and after that enter the received password in the desired filed,” he added.Vishwavidyalaya, Central Secretariat and Hauz Khas Metro stations will soon get this free wi-fi facility
