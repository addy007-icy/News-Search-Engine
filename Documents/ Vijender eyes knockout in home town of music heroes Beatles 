Star Indian boxer Vijender Singh on Thursday said it would be a dream come true to fight his fourth professional bout in Liverpool, the birthplace of his music heroes — The Beatles.Undefeated so far with three knockout wins, Vijender fight his first bout of the year at the Liverpool Echo Arena and is looking to put up another explosive performance.The 30-year-old from Haryana says John, Paul, Ringo and George are his musical icons.“When I turned professional in England I hoped that I would one day fight in Liverpool and fight at the birthplace of my heroes, now that dream will come true on February 13,” said Vijender.“I love the Beatles music and I remember all the hits Hey Jude, Yesterday, All You Need Is Love, Let It Be, Penny Lane, Here Comes The Sun, I love it all!“I can’t wait to get to Liverpool, I’ve never fought in the city before as an amateur so now I will get my chance to get down to the Cavern Club finally. Madison Square Garden may be the home of boxing, but for me I have to get to the Cavern Club,” he added.“I admired boxing legends like Ali and Sugar Ray growing up, but they were never really my heroes, The Beatles however were the centre of my life growing up, I wanted to be a rock star! We’ll I’m rocking opponents in the ring now!”
