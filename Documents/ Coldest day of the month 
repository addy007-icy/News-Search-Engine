: After witnessing a rather warm January, Delhiites felt the chill on Thursday as the mercury dipped to make it the coldest 'day' of the month with the lowest recorded maximum temperature.Delhi’s brush with freak weather, however, continues as despite the maximum temperature coming down by a few notches compared to previous few days, the minimum temperature remained comparatively higher.The maximum temperature in Delhi on Thursday was 19 degrees Celsius, one degree below the average temperature for this time of the year. The minimum temperature, on the other hand, was six degrees above normal at 13.6 degrees Celsius.The weatherman has forecast a partly cloudy sky with likely chances of moderate to dense fog occurring on Friday morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures are very likely to hover around 21 and 11 degree Celcius, respectively.The rather high minimum temperature during the night meant that Thursday didn’t witness fog dense enough to affect flight schedules.“A fresh fog or smog spell started at Delhi but did not lead to very dense fog at night due to lack of cooling,” said Dr. R.K. Jenamani, Director-in-Charge of the MeT unit at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport.
