Sankranti festival could well herald a promising year for the family of a 30-year-old autorickshaw driver from Mahabubnagar.The heart surgeons of State-run Gandhi Hospital have embarked on their first ever heart transplantation surgery on Thursday evening on the autorickshaw driver.The surgeons have managed to get a donor heart from a brain dead patient at Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) and have started the process of retrieval and then transplantation surgery at Gandhi Hospital. Under the Jeevandan organ donation scheme, the surgeons procured the donor heart and have taken up an all-night transplant surgery, to save the life of the autorickshaw driver.The 30-year-old was admitted to Gandhi Hospital following a massive heart attack. According to hospital doctors, the patient was brought with Ischemic Cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the patient suffers a heart attack because of weak heart muscles.“Heart transplantation was the only option to save the life of this patient. For the past few months, we have been preparing a lot of groundwork at Gandhi Hosptial to take up heart transplantation. We have succeeded and hopefully the transplant surgery will go smoothly,” senior heart transplant surgeons at Gandhi Hospital said.It may be recalled that several bureaucratic hurdles were threatening to derail attempts by doctors at Gandhi Hospital to take up heart transplantation, which will be for the first time by a Government Hospital in Telangana.
