Adding pride to the city’s traffic map, the final stretch of the multi-crore Kozhikode bypass road was thrown open to the public at a colourful function near Paloramala here on Friday.Chief Minister Oommen Chandy opened the 5.1-km Vengalam-Pooladikkunnu stretch, which was finished by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) in just 15 months. It was also the first National Highway project fully funded by the State government.In his inaugural address, Mr. Chandy said the State government would be taking immediate measures to accord administrative sanction to the proposed flyovers at Thondayad and Ramanattukara. “Also fund would be allotted in the next budget to acquire additional land for the widening of the Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu road,” he added.Industries Minister P.K. Kunhalikuty chaired the inaugural function.Minister for Public Works V.K. Ebrahim Kunju and Minister for Panchayats and Social Justice M.K. Muneer were present.PWD officials said the bypass road, with the completed final stretch, would be a boon for vehicles from the Kannur side to reach Calicut International Airport and Thrissur road without entering the crowded city roads. It would also play a crucial role in reducing the traffic congestion in the city. Emergency service vehicles to prominent hospitals would be another direct beneficiary of the new road. The number of direct access roads to the new stretch was deliberately reduced to ensure the uninterrupted flow of long distance vehicles on the route.
