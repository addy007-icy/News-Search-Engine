Vaasanthi Ravi, disciple of M.V.N. Murthy and Kalpana Srinivas of the Kuchipudi Arts Academy, Chennai, began her performance with an invocation to Lord Vishnu with ‘Vande Vasudevam’ in Sree raga, khanda chapu tala.This was followed by the traditional piece ‘Neela mega sareera’ in ragamalika. This Balagopala Tharangam of Narayana Tirtha was the highlight of the evening. Choreographed brilliantly by the legendary Guru Vempatti Chinna Satyam, it stood out for its fast-paced jatis.Unlike Bharatanatyam, where jatis are uttered in spaces between verse lines, in Kuchipudi, sometimes the nattuvangam artist utters syllables in a lower tone, while the vocalist is still singing.In this recital, the vocalist’s voice was found lacking in some places, perhaps due to a repetition of lines, with minor mispronunciations.Vaasanthi depicted the childhood pranks of Krishna in this piece. The dancer alternated comfortably between the roles of Yashoda and balakrishna.A Kuchipudi presentation is usually not complete without the difficult brass-plate piece, which made up the latter part of Vaasanthi’s performance. Isn’t it customary to begin this with a sloka and end with one? Perhaps as tradition evolves, changes are inevitable.In the ragamalika Mandooka Sabdam that was taken up next, Vaasanthi depicted the story of Gajendra, the elephant, caught by the crocodile.It seems the tussle lasted nearly a thousand years. Choreographed again by the late Vempatti Chinna Satyam, this combined the effervescent Shanmukhapriya and sober Madhyamavati.The dancer concluded her recital with a brisk tillana in Dhanasree, choreographed by Vempatti Ravishankar. Vaasanthi was supported by Kalpana Srinivas on nattuvangam, Saswathi Jagadeesh on vocal, Ramshankar Babu on mridangam and Muruganandam on violin.
