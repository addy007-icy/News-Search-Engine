Actor Dhanush, who was accused by pro-jallikattu activists of ‘betraying a Tamil cause’ on social media, has clarified that he supports jallikattu. A news report which claimed that he supported the apex court ban on the sport had gone viral on social media.Dhanush’s previous association with People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and he being voted the ‘hottest vegetarian’ in a poll conducted by the organisation made the report appear authentic.
