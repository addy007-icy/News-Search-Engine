Indian eves will play the Governor-General’s XI, comprising a mix of experienced and talented young players, in a Twenty20 cricket match at the Drummoyne Oval in Sydney on January 22.It was announced on Monday by Governor-General of Australia Peter Cosgrove and Cricket Australia (CA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Sutherland.Indian eves are scheduled to tour Australia for a three Twenty20 Internationals and One-Day Internationals (ODI) each from January 26 to February 7.The fixture has been inspired by the annual Prime Minister’s XI match for Australia’s male cricketers which was instituted by Robert Menzies in 1951.The Governor-General’s XI will be selected by CA in consultation with the Governor-General.“Australia’s women cricketers are the best in the world. The Governor-General’s XI is an opportunity to showcase many of these experienced and up-and-coming players against formidable international teams,” said Cosgrove.Sutherland, on his part, said the match will become an annual affair. “Australian cricket is honoured that the Governor-General has chosen to support the game in this way. Our goal is to see cricket become the sport of choice for women and girls across the nation, whether as participants or fans, and this annual fixture is another important step in helping realise that vision,” said Sutherland.“Almost a quarter of the 1.2 million Australians now playing cricket are women and girls and their numbers continue to grow rapidly. Drawing more females to the game, as players and fans, presents as the most significant opportunity for cricket to become incredibly strong and enduring.”
