Adding to the spirit of celebrations of the Republic Day, a number of Indian Navy ships participating in the International Fleet Review would line up at anchorage off the RK Beach ‘Dressed’ in their best.During the daytime, visitors to the beach would be able to see Dressing Ships with maritime signal flags strung from the foremast of the ship (Jackstaff) till the mast on its stern (Ensign Staff) passing through the other masts in the middle.Dressing Ships is a maritime tradition in which these flags are arranged on a long rope called a Dressing Line and when hoisted, is a sign of celebration. Indian Navy ships normally dress overall on the occasion of the Republic Day (January 26), Coast Guard Day (February 1), Maritime Day (April 5), Independence Day (August 15) and Navy Day (December 4).Ships also dress overall on occasions of national importance and ceremonial occasions such as when the President of India or other heads of state embark. When a ship is dressed overall, apart from the dressing line, on each of the middle masts, the naval flag, called the Naval Ensign, is flown with the Jack Staff displaying the National Flag and the Ensign Staff also displaying the Naval Ensign. During the International Fleet Review 2016, all ships participating in the Presidential Review on February 7, including foreign warships and merchant ships would dress overall.On most occasions of dressing ships, after sunset, the ships at anchorage also illuminate their outlines using special lights laid out for the purpose called an illumination garland. Special care is taken to position the illumination garland in such a manner that the prominent lines of the ship are clearly visible from afar. On Tuesday after sunset and during the IFR-16, the ships at anchorage would also be illuminated. Though incandescent bulbs are normally used for this purpose, the Indian Navy, in keeping with the environmental concern, would be using special LED lights on the illumination garlands during IFR-16 for the first time.
