An RTI activist on Tuesday moved the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Bhubaneswar, seeking thorough investigation into the formation of the Odisha Knowledge Corporation Limited (OKCL) and utilisation of central funds for popularising IT education in school level.“The setting up of OKCL with the equity participation of Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited and the private institution is itself a fraudulent action committed on the State by its own officers contrary to the guidelines of Government of India,” said Pradip Pradhan, the activist who submitted a complaint with the Superintendent of Police of CBI, Bhubaneswar, on Tuesday.Mr. Pradhan alleged that the OKCL was a product of mala fide intentions as government funds meant for IT education in schools were shared among private persons and organisations.“The State government has got its own organisation like the Odisha Computer Application Centre, IIIT (International Institute of Information Technology) and State Institute of Education Technology (SIET) to promote Information Communication Technology in education. However, the OKCL was set up without consulting specialised organisations like OCAC and IIIT. It gives rise to suspicion to mis-utilisation of government funds,” he charged.Mr. Pradhan alleged top officials of the State government were involved in bungling of central fund.Over alleged bungling of Central funds in the name of IT education
