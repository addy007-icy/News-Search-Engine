A combing party of the Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force on Tuesday night opened one round of fire in the forests abutting Kalyani dam in the Tirupati-Bhakarapeta section and nabbed four TN woodcutters and seized as many as 28 logs from them.The forest personnel chased the fleeing woodcutters and caught two of them on the same beat. The task force chief and DIG M. Kantha Rao said that the combing parties opened one round from “pump action gun” to scare away the woodcutters and to prevent them from decamping with the precious logs.It is estimated that around 100 woodcutters sneaked into the western side of the Tirumala hills after a lull of a month.
