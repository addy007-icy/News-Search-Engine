A chemistry professor from IIT, Madras, has innovated technology for purifying water using nano materials. Nanotechnology can purify arsenic contaminants in water and has been successfully demonstrated in arsenic-contaminated areas of Murshidabad in West Bengal. Scientist P. Pradeep, who developed this technology with support of Pradeep Research Group, discussed the benefits of this technology at a session on Safe Water and Sanitation here on Tuesday. He and his team’s research found that combining the capacity of diverse nano composites to scavenge toxic species can result in affordable, all-inclusive drinking water purifiers that can function without electricity.— Shankar BennurPradeep Research Group to provide arsenic-free water to six lakh people within 12 months
