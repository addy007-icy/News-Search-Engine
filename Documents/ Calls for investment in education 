Scientist C.N.R. Rao said that only 2 per cent of India’s GDP is spent on education, of which a mere 0.5 per cent goes to higher education and the remaining to primary and secondary education.In South Korea, 4 per cent of GDP is spent on science and technology and 7 per cent on education. South Korea can be a good example for India, Mr. Rao said at the Indian Science Congress here.The country’s science and technology and educational institutions need more attention with larger investments. Universities have not been getting enough funding, he observed.
