A shopkeeper in south-west Delhi’s Najafgarh had a narrow escape after a customer shot at him on Saturday. The reason was the unavailability of a particular brand of cigarettes.The accused is yet to be arrested, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West) R.A. Sanjeev said the incident was reported from the shop of one Ramkhiladi.“It was around 9 p.m. that the suspect came to the shop on a motorcycle and asked for Commander cigarettes. Ramkhiladi told the police that he had run out of those cigarettes,” said Mr. Sanjeev.However, this explanation did not suffice for the suspect, a young man, who then demanded that the shopkeeper arrange it for him. This led to an argument between the two during which the accused fished out a weapon and fired at Ramkhiladi. The bullet missed its target, while Ramkhiladi lost his balance and fell, said Mr. Sanjeev.“The suspect drove away after this and the victim called the police,” the DCP added.Police suspect that the accused is a drug addict. “The Commander cigarettes have thicker paper, which makes it easier for addicts to fill a mix of tobacco and contraband into the tobacco rod. His behaviour and other features, as described by Ramkhiladi, also indicate the same,” said Mr. Sanjeev.The suspect has been booked under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant provisions of the Arms Act.Police suspect that the accused, who is yet to be arrested, is a drug addict.
