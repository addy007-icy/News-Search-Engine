Justice P.V. Sanjay Kumar of the Hyderabad High Court on Wednesday expressed concern over the State governmentâ€™s decision to collect money from students for the construction of the capital. The judge said that the contribution should be voluntary and added that any deviation from rules would be viewed seriously. The court was dealing with a petition filed by Basheer from Mangalagiri of Guntur district. In the petition, he stated that he was a carpenter, and that his son had been asked to pay towards capital construction.
