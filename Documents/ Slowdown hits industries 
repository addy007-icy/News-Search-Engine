For the industries in Coimbatore, it was a year of drop in orders, slowdown in the economy and lack of investments.Be it textiles, pumpsets, property, or engineering units, 2015 was a year of economic slowdown in the international and domestic markets.“In fact, it was one of the worst years for small and medium-scale enterprises in the city,” says E.K. Ponnuswamy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries’ Association. Except for automobiles, MSMEs catering to the other sectors saw a drop in orders. Valve making units were hit by low international oil prices and steel sector was affected by lack of investment in infrastructure. Most of the MSMEs operated only 60 per cent to 70 per cent capacity. Hence, there were no new investments or expansion projects too, he said.Large-scale private sector industries and public sector undertakings need to invest and increase orders for the MSMEs to do better. And, infrastructure projects should be expedited. “We need efforts that will bring back investments in the private sector here,” he says. Sectors such as pumpsets have seen indications of revival in the last one month. Similarly, with the Government announcing the amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme, the textile sector hopes to see more investments soon.“All sectors of the industry should improve. Agriculture sector is expected to do good this year. This will revive the economy,” says V. Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association.
