Chandra Sekhar said.The CCB Police have recovered from them six mobile phones, four swords, among others.He gave the names of the arrested persons as Gaurish (26), Jayesh (23), Naveen Shetty (34), Praveen Kumar (26), Harshith (22) and Guruprasad (30).In another case, the CCB Police arrested Sachin Gowda (31) and Pawan Shetty (21) near the KSRTC bus stand and recovered two mobile phones, a country-made pistol and five live bullets.Mr. Chandra Sekhar said that all the six Vikki Shetty-associates were part of one group. The police are investigating what they were doing at the time of their arrest.Gaurish is an accused in the murder of Vikki, who had criminal antecedents, in the Ullal Police Station limits in October 2015. Jayesh, Naveen and Praveen are accused in the murder of Pachhu alias Prashant near the Mangala Bar in Valencia in April 2013.Mr. Chandra Sekhar said that the police were investigating how the country-made pistol, which was usually made in Uttar Pradesh, came into their possession.
