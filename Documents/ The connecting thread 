When Sunita, who lived in a local Delhi basti, was looking for work to make ends meet, her family was reluctant, worried about her safety. Timely help came from Farida Gupta, whose ethnic clothing venture, ‘Folklore’, imparted training in traditional embroidery, enabling Sunita to work from home.A decade later, Sunita is an integral part of Farida’s team, a dynamic group of artisans and designers whose creations have become a by-word for ethnic chic. “We provide long-term employment opportunities for women from underprivileged backgrounds,” says Farida. “The training is free of cost. They learn ari, kantha and other stitches, and embroider clothing designed by me, using hand-block printed cotton fabric. Over 200 such women artisans in our team make a sustainable living. The materials, featuring traditional crafts and techniques such as dyeing, printing and hand embroidery, are sourced from Rajasthan, Gujarat and the south. Our aim is to keep these ebbing crafts alive by designing contemporary wear garments using natural materials and indigenous skills.”The designer says that the collection is all about affordability, comfort and wearability. “Pricing is one of our strong points — our creations start at Rs. 850 and go on to Rs. 3,500 (after discount, for our limited edition tussar silk evening wear),” says Farida. What makes the collection suitable for today’s multi-tasking woman is that it is not high-maintenance.The exhibition will feature a bouquet of ‘spring’ shades, such as peach, fuchsia, purple, citrus hues, indigo resist prints and icy pastels in blue and green. Classic cuts and clean lines create slimming silhouettes, for women in all sizes. Lightweight dupattas, stoles, kaftans and night-wear complement the collection.The three-day exhibition will be on at C.P. Art Centre, Alwarpet, from January 12-14, from 13 and 14 January, 2016. Timings: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
