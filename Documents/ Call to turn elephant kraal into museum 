With the six inmates of the famed elephant kraal at Kodanad, near Perumbavoor, being shifted to the nearby Abhayaranyam recently, there is a call to turn the elephant taming centre into a museum as well as for the upkeep of the kraal to draw tourists to the area.An official of the State Department of Forests said the kraal would be preserved though it had virtually fallen into disuse now. Koovappady block panchayat member M.P. Prakash said the kraal should be preserved as a heritage site.He said that he had submitted a memorandum to the State authorities for the upkeep of the kraal.He said there was a park near the kraal, which could also be developed into a major tourist attraction.The elephant kraal was built around 1895 under the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore when capture of wild elephants for ceremonial purposes and for logging began. Records show that the kraal was repaired in 1965.There are six elephants now at Abhayaranyam, two of them belonging to private owners.The Forest Department official said that Abhayaranyam was spread over a total area of 138 hectares.
