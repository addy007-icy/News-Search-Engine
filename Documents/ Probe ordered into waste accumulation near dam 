The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has ordered an inquiry into accumulation of waste in Aruvikkara reservoir, the lone source of drinking water to city.SHRC chairman J.B. Koshy in his order directed the District Collector, Additional Chief Secretary, Water Resources Department and Environmental Engineer, Pollution Control Board, to conduct an inquiry. The report should be placed before the Commission during its sitting slated for February 29, the order said.Acting on a complaint filed by the chairman of the Bharathiya Adhivasi Seva Karyalayam, Chembankod V. Manikantan, Mr. Koshy sought a detailed inquiry into the allegation that the reservoir was filled with waste. The complainant in his petition had noted that the reservoir was full of weeds and plastic waste. The accumulation of waste had resulted in water stagnation. It had also resulted in the reservoirâ€™s storage capacity shrinking. The waste had not been removed for the past 80 years, the complainant said.The issue also came up for discussion at the District Development Council meeting on Thursday. District Collector Biju Prabhakar has asked departments concerned to carry out measures to rectify complaints about unhygienic environment of the reservoir.The plight of the reservoir had become a topic of discussion in the past few months. People residing near the reservoir have formed the Aruvikkara Jalasambharani Samrakshana Samara Samithi to highlight the need for cleaning the Aruvikkara reservoir and restoring its storage capacity. The samithi had organised an exhibition of photographs in the city on the issue.The issue also had its political overtones with a visit made by Communist Party of India (Marxist) politburo member Pinarayi Vijayan to the reservoir site.SHRC directive to submit report on February 29Waste accumulation results in water stagnation
