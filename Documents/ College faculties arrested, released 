Police arrested 189 faculties of colleges, including 38 women, when they attempted to lay a siege to the Office of Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education at Sindhupoondurai here on Wednesday.Led by office-bearers of Joint Action Council of College Teachers – Tamil Nadu, including Manohara Justus and S. Subbaraju, the protestors, who attempted to stage a protest, were arrested.Speaking amidst the protestors, Prof. Subbaraju said that 3,210 teaching posts in government and aided colleges across Tamil Nadu had been vacant since May 2007 despite repeated appeals from the college teachers’ associations to fill these vacancies with qualified teachers in a transparent manner.When the government allowed the aided college administrations to fill the vacancies in their institutions, norms were violated in the appointments, he alleged.“Above all, five universities in Tamil Nadu have been remaining ‘headless’ for the past several months following the retirement of the Vice-Chancellors. Qualified educationists having stupendous track record in their field should be handpicked for these posts in a transparent manner,” Prof. Subbaraju said. The arrested were released in the evening.
