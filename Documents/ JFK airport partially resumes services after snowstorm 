A day after life-threatening monster snowstorm almost paralysed the entire US East Coast, the iconic John F Kennedy International airport here partially resumed its services with Air India’s plane being the first one to land at the airport.Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said John F Kennedy International had its first arrival at 7:10 a.m. on Sunday as Air India flight landed on the tarmac.The first departing flight left shortly after 10 am. The three airports in and around the city — LaGuardia, Newwark Liberty and John F Kennedy — however had very limited resumption of service.Hundreds of flights were still cancelled, with LaGuardia accounting for more than 700 cancellations on Sunday.In Washington DC, all flights remained cancelled over the weekend.In a statement, Reagan International Airport said it expects at least one runway to open for flight operations on Monday.Same was the case with the Dulles International Airport.“We expect airlines to operate limited flight schedules at both airports throughout the day on Monday. Passengers should check with their airlines for information about their specific flights,” a media statement said.Called ‘Snowzilla’, the blizzard propelled by tropical-storm-force winds brought much of US Northeast to a standstill and left as much as three feet of snow, prompting at least 10 States to declare a state of emergency.
