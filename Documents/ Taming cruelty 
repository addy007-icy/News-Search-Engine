The decision of the Supreme Court to stay the Centre’s notification on jallikattu should be welcomed. Jallikattu is a cruel game in which bulls are tortured and those who try to tame the bulls are injured or, at times, even killed. I don’t understand why it is considered part of festival celebrations at all. Should people celebrate the torture of animals and the victory of human beings over animals? Leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had lifted the ban imposed by the apex court just to please local political parties in Tamil Nadu. The Bench of Justices Dipak Misra and N.V. Ramana have appropriately raised the question: What is the necessity of a festival like jallikattu?Albert P’Rayan,ChennaiIt is very disappointing that the Supreme Court has denied permission for jallikattu. The Animal Welfare Board’s argument that bulls are ill-treated and injured in the name of tradition and sport is fallacious. If domesticated bulls can be used for agriculture and transport, why not for jallikattu? If we were to accept that using animals for sport amounts to cruelty, we need to apply the argument to all animals. The capture and use of elephants in temple processions and tourism displays should be banned. We know that domesticated elephants are used even to seek alms. Also, many temple elephants are ill-treated by the mahouts. However, this is not considered cruelty.Eswari Arun,Thiruchirapalli
