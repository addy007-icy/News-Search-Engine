The Mission Green Sabarimala programme launched by the Pathanamthitta district administration to keep the sacred grove of Ayyappa situated in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) free of plastic and litter has turned out to be a hit.District Collector S. Harikishore said not less than 8,750 tonnes of plastic waste were left scattered in the Sabarimala forests during the previous pilgrim season. It included plastic bottles, food wrappers, use-and-throw raincoats and carry bags.Experts have warned against dumping of non-biodegradable plastic waste in the PTR, posing threat to the forests and the Pampa river system. The strategy of the mission — which included a series of pilgrim awareness programmes, deployment of ‘green guards’ to prevent pilgrims from throwing clothes into the Pampa, installation of a reverse osmosis plant for supplying drinking water through water kiosks at Pampa — had paid off, bringing about positive behavioural changes in pilgrims.The Suchitwa Mission, the Kudumbasree Mission, the Tourism Department and other agencies and companies had extended financial support to the programme. Mr. Harikishore said five lakh cloth bags were distributed to the pilgrims in exchange of plastic carry bags. Two lakh leaflets and 1.5 lakh CDs of a short film that depicted the importance of keeping Sabarimala clean were distributed.He said bottles and other plastic waste collected from Sabarimala and the Pampa were transported out of the pilgrim centre with the help of a Thiruvalla-based firm, Chris Global. Mr. Harikishore said the support of the judiciary too played a key role in the success of the programme.
