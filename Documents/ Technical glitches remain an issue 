Many consumers have welcomed the initiative of paying power bills at ATP centres, but recurring issues have been discouraging some of them from using the facility. “The machine did not accept the cheque during my last payment. It ejects out the currency notes if they are in bad condition. We can’t fault the machine, but getting currency notes in perfect condition every time is certainly an issue,” said C. Durgaprasad, a consumer from Thummalagunta area of Tirupati.Further, the machines are not free from technical glitches. “Sometimes it takes longer than expected to process the bills. Once they get stuck, be it operators or consumers, they wait sans any clue till the machines respond and resume operations. We can pay our bills at Mee Seva counters or simply opt for online payment, which are easier and faster too,” said N. Jayaprakash Narayana, another consumer.Speaking to The Hindu , a senior discom official said they were in the process of streamlining the nagging issues with ATPs, announcing that they would introduce new features such as acceptance of cheques, multiple bills, reconnection fees and others. “We are in talks with the consultants to fix all the issues. We will increase the number of ATPs in the districts falling under the discom’s purview,” he added.Sometimes it takes longer than expected to process the bills.
