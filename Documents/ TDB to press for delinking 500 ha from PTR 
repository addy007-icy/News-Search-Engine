The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has decided to approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking delinking of 500 hectares of forestland in and around Sabarimala from the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) for providing foolproof basic pilgrim facilities as recommended by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament a decade ago.Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan and member Ajay Tharayil said they would meet the Prime Minister after the Makaravilakku festival seeking his help in developing Sabarimala into an international pilgrimage centre by providing sustainable amenities.Inadequate facilitiesThe TDB leaders said Sabarimala, situated 467 metres above mean sea level, has been plagued by grossly inadequate basic pilgrim facilities due to non-availability of space.Mr. Tharayil said the concept of Sabarimala pilgrimage itself stood for preserving the pristine glory of the sacred grove ( poonkavanam ) and the TDB was for providing basic pilgrim facility there in an eco-friendly manner. However, frequent intervention and intimidation by the Forest Department have been posing hurdles on the path of the temple administrative bodyâ€™s efforts to ensure proper basic pilgrim facilities at Sabarimala, he said.He said the board had only 25 hectares of land, allotted by the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, in its possession at Sabarimala. He added that a TDB team would invite Mr. Modi to visit Sabarimala at the earliest.Mr. Tharayil said the PAC visited Sabarimala in 2004, and in 2005 to collect first-hand information regarding the problems faced by the pilgrim centre. Chapter II of one of the reports submitted by the PAC has discussed problems facing the pilgrims on account of the inclusion of Sabarimala in the PTR. The report has categorically stated that delinking Sabarimala from the PTR was the only remedial measure to address the plight of the pilgrims.
