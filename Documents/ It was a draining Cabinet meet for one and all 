The marathon meeting of the Telangana Cabinet on Saturday may have brought cheer to some sections for whose benefit several decisions were taken but it was exhausting to Ministers and officials as they had to be alert throughout the period from 11.40 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., barring two breaks in between.It was even more taxing to some Ministers who have the habit of chewing a ‘pan’ or smoking frequently.By the time the meeting ended, some of the Ministers appeared drained out completely.Excise Minister T. Padma Rao made no secret of his craving for ‘pan’ after the meeting stating that he controlled it with great difficulty.However, during a break in between, when the Ministers went to attend the marriage ceremony of Deputy Chief Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali’s kin, Mr. Padma Rao had two pans when some of his colleagues consumed food.Later, the car driving him home continuously honked its way through heavy traffic at the traffic junction near Ambedkar statue on Tank Bund.Engg. colleges on recruitment spree Private colleges affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad are on a roll to recruit teachers.But unfortunately the drill remains only on paper.While this year’s second semester in B Tech courses of the university is already into its second month, college administrations are sending out advertisements by the dozen for faculty recruitment.Whether this is for the benefit of teacher starved students is of doubt because the exercise seems to be taking place just months before the university’s annual inspection of the colleges.The inspection meant to check on All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) standards in colleges usually stresses on the student-teacher ratio.As it was only last year that the varsity prevented scores of colleges from admitting students citing lack of sufficient number of faculty members as reason, college managements seem to be on an extra cautious path to at least make an attempt to maintain the required 1:15 ratio.Whether colleges will be able to fill up 25,000 faculty vacancies in JNTU’s affiliated colleges is still of doubt as qualified teachers are mostly not willing to work without the security of sixth pay commission salaries.But the advertisements will surely help the managements tell JNTU on record that they are on a faculty admission process.Netas on inauguration spree Just when one thought there are no more elections and the concentration can be on governance so that long pending infrastructure issues can be taken up for the capital, the GHMC polls return to the stage. Hence, we find a spree of inaugurations and foundation stones being laid with great alacrity by the Ministers plus roads are getting repaired, water being supplied steadily and power cuts a thing of the past.The TRS seems to have taken the polls as a prestigious issue with cut-outs of the various welfare and development schemes taken up or proposed by the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao almost on every road. It is hoping that from ‘naught’, it can become the ruling party in GHMC with the help of Majlis.Ministers, MLAs and other public representatives having changed colours from yellow to pink in recent times are hoping to do the tough task. But, will they be able to break the stranglehold of the yellow-saffron parties or will they be able to break fresh ground will be interesting to watch.
