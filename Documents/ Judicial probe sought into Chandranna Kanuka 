The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee has demanded that the government order an inquiry by a sitting judge into the alleged irregularities that were reported in the implementation of schemes like Chandranna Kanuka.APCC vice-president S. Sailajanath alleged that the government did not initiate action against those involved in the irregularities like supply of sub-standard commodities to the beneficiaries in the Chandranna Kanuka scheme. “The government’s reluctance to act against those committing the irregularities is tantamount to admitting the involvement of the Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his Cabinet colleagues in them,” he said.Dr. Sailajanath wondered as to why the government was not initiating action against the reported irregularities that had surfaced in the Municipal Administration Department and the Rs. 2,000 crore loss incurred by the State ex-chequer in sand sales. Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who repeatedly expresses concern about the irregularities in the Revenue department was, however, reluctant to make public the action taken to check the menace, he alleged.“The government is trying to shield those close to the powers that be who are guilty of irregularities,” he alleged. “The Chief Minister had neglected the administration and was working more as event manager/chief executive officer for personal interests,” Dr. Sailajanath said. He faulted the government for its decision to collect donations from students and teachers for construction of the capital city.
