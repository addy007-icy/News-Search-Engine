Seeking the arrest of those responsible for the suicide of a Dalit research scholar at the University of Hyderabad, various Dalit organisations took out a protest march in Hubballi on Thursday.The organisations also sought a ban on the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, alleging that it was responsible for the suicide.The protest march began from Ambedkar Statue near the Head Post Office and covered Lamington Road and Kittur Chennamma Circle. Raising slogans against the “anti-Dalit” leaders and officers of the university, the protestors sought the immediate arrest of Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya, terming them as “anti-dalit.”They vehemently condemned “attempts to keep Dalits away from the field of higher education and from becoming followers of B.R. Ambedkar.”At Kittur Chennamma Circle the protestors held a demonstration for some time before proceeding to Mini Vidhanasoudha, where they submitted a memorandum addressed to the President. Office-bearers of various Dalit ogranisations led the protest march.In the memorandum, the Dalit organisations have also sought protection to Dalits from such institutionalised attacks.
