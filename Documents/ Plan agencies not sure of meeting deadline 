The new Plan management system being experimented by the State government is reported to have suffered a jolt with the executing agencies expressing serious reservation about meeting the deadline set for preparing the “ready to implement’’ schemes for the next financial year.Planning and Economic Affairs Department sources told The Hindu here that as per the deadline set by the Finance Department, all meetings of the Plan Preparation Group (PPG) constituted for drawing up and listing out schemes costing up to Rs.5 crore and the Special Plan Preparation Group (SPG) formed for formulating schemes above Rs.5 crore should be completed for securing mandatory clearances before January 7 to facilitate the budget preparation process.The groups also have been directed to complete such processes within one month after the Planning Board communicated the Plan outlay for the year.Out of the Rs.20,000 crore outlay provided for the State Plan schemes for the current year, the expenditure till September 30 last was only Rs.4,986.88 crore, around 24 per cent.Since then, there was barely any palpable progress in absorption and it continues to remain much below 40 per cent.In this context, all key departments are engrossed in the task of utilising the funds.In the wake of the firm directive to prepare and submit Plan schemes amounting to 25 per cent of the outlay for next year within the set deadline, they are finding the going tough.Being overburdened, they fear that it would derail the execution of schemes for the current year as well as the planning process for the next year. Rather than opting for such a makeover at the fag end of its tenure, the government should have thought about it earlier and that would have at least helped to jack up the fund utilisation rate in the previous years, sources said.Moreover, a new government assuming charge after the elections may have a different set of priorities and may totally eschew the new management system mooted at present.Futile exerciseIn that case the whole exercise may end up as futile exercise.The officers concerned should inform the authorities concerned about the hassles to honour the January 7 deadline, sources said.
