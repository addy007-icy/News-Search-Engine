“Around 90 per cent of the small apartment complexes in the city’s suburban areas do not have the necessary space required to facilitate easy access for fire tenders. Lack of unobstructed path around the building hinders efforts of Fire and Rescue Services personnel during fire outbreaks,” Sundaravadhanan Vinod, an apartment owner in Thillai Ganga Nagar, Nanganallur, said.Some of the residents of Ram Nagar in Nanganallur — where J. Venkataramani and his wife Sowmya suffocated to death owing to smoke from a fire in their flat — said that there had been a proliferation of apartment complexes in the suburban areas in the last decade and the smaller ones did not have a fire-fighting system in place. The residents said that the small complexes had been built on one or two grounds of land.
