: Not just private car owners with even-numbered vehicles, but auto rickshaw drivers figured prominently on the list of those issued fines for offences ranging from refusing to ply by fare meters to plying at all. Over 60 auto rickshaw drivers were challaned.“There was rampant fleecing in Connaught Place,” said Radhika Gupta, 28, a private executive. “I was refused by four auto drivers before I ended up settling for one who charged me Rs. 70 to ply just four kilometres away,” she added. Auto drivers admitted they were doing brisk business with many claiming they hadn’t even been able to even take tea breaks.
