The Kerala Dam Safety Authority chaired by former judge of the High Court C.N. Ramachandran Nair on Monday visited the Kunnar check-dam in Sabarimala forests to explore the possibility of capacity augmentation of the water reservoir on the basis of a High Court direction in this regard.The High Power Committee chaired by K. Jayakumar, former Chief Secretary, had proposed augmentation of the storage capacity of the Kunnar check-dam in the upper forest reaches of Sabarimala that has mainly been catering to the water needs of the Sabarimala Sannidhanam for the past several years.The proposal was to augment the storage capacity by 40 lakh litres by increasing the dam height by 2.5 metres without doing any harm to the forest environs. Experts opined that the project would not necessitate any tree felling. Instead, it would be beneficial to the wild fauna and flora too during summer months, according to Travancore Devaswom Board chief engineer G. Muraleekrishnan.However, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests has denied environment clearance for the Kunnar dam capacity augmentation project proposal following certain objections raised by the Forest Department.Meanwhile, an expert team of the Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, had given technical clearance for the proposed capacity augmentation of the 3.5-metre tall Kunnar check-dam.The Dam Safety Authorityâ€™s visit has got special significance in the backdrop of this.
