A trench on Third Main Road, beneath the Chennai Bypass Road, in Ambattur, which had been dug up to discharge stagnant rainwater from industrial units into the Cooum, through stormwater drains, is yet to be closed.With poor illumination, the trench poses a threat to motorists passing through the stretch every day.After repeated representations from residents, motorists and police officials too, the civic authorities concerned closed one portion of the trench (towards Padi) with the leftover sand nearby.However, the other portion (towards Nolambur) of the stretch remains open. In fact, most part of the stretch is severely damaged with many sandy patches on it.A small sandy mound, on either side of the trench, prevents motorists from falling into the open trench. As there are no reflectors and barricades for cautioning motorists, there is a higher likelihood of this happening during night.“The trench hinders free movement of traffic, as vehicles from the opposite direction too use the same lane,” said S. Ramesh, a motorist from Nolambur. The road provides a short cutfor motorists to reach Anna Nagar and Tirumangalam from Ambattur, Mannurpet, Thirumullavoyal, J.J. Nagar and Maduravoyal.Motorists from the interior parts of Mogappair East, Ambattur, Padi, Korattur, Nolambur and Anna Nagar West use the stretch to reach places such as Maduravoyal, Porur and Tambaram via the Chennai Bypass Road.Further, the road connects the major parts of the city and is also a link to the neighbouring districts including Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur.It also connects the industrial belts in Sriperambadur and Oragadam in Kancheepuram district with the Kolkata Highway (NH-05) via Poonamallee High (PH) Road.A few motorists said that the road was widely used by heavy vehicles and MTC buses and that it should be re-laid with bitumen. The trench must be closed at the earliest, before any untoward incident occurs.“We would take steps to close the trench after completing the channel work,” said a Corporation official.
