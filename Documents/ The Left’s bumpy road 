Sitaram Yechury’s coronation as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) was hailed by all the Left forces in the country (“The Left’s bumpy road to revival,”Jan.08). Now, the responsibility of resuscitating and rejuvenating is on Mr. Yechury’s strong shoulders. Regaining lost ground in West Bengal, increasing the space in Kerala and maintaining the status quo in Tripura is a Herculean task.However, merely joining hands with other opposition parties in attacking the RSS for all social evils in the country and writing a few articles in Peoples Democracy will not sufficiently accelerate the party’s growth. The need of the hour for the CPI(M) is to build support in Central and North India where tens of millions of Adivasis and Dalits live lives devoid of dignity. It needs to transform theoretical Marxism to practical Marxism and strengthen grassroots activism in all parts of the country. Only then can the Left prove to the downtrodden that they are the real representatives of the suppressed.Ravi Mannethu,Pullad, Kerala
