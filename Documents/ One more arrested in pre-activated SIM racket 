One more person has been nabbed by the Delhi Police Crime Branch in connection with the pre-activated SIM card racket, whose operations here came to light following the recently busted espionage case. Accused Mohit Gupta ran a telecom shop in North-West Delhi’s Shakurpur.Less than a fortnight ago, the Crime Branch nabbed a man who provided SIM cards to people who wished to obtain a phone number without submitting identification proof. “Skilled in using computers, Mr. Gupta would create fake identity cards at his office and use them to activate SIM cards,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravindra Yadav.These SIM cards were then sold for Rs.500-Rs.700 each. Whether these SIM cards helped anyone associated with the espionage racket is yet to be proved.The police claim that a scan of the laptop belonging to the accused led to the recovery of nearly 1,000 fake ID cards and as many passport-sized photographs of various persons. Several blank customer acquisition forms too have been recovered.The 33-year-old was nabbed on Friday by a Crime Branch team led by Additional Commissioner of Police K.P.S. Malhotra and under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner of Police Bhisham Singh.The Crime Branch turned their focus on the pre-activated SIM card racket, after five persons were arrested recently for allegedly providing confidential information to Pakistan-based agencies.It was during this probe that the police learnt the number used by the person of Indian origin at the India-Pakistan border to contact his agents in India was issued in Delhi.Such rackets, the police say, pose a great threat to national security as people are able to communicate without leaving a trail. Efforts to crackdown on other similar rackets are on, said the police.Mohit Gupta would create fake IDs in his office and use them to activate SIM cards
