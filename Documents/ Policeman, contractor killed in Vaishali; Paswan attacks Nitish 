An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of Police and a contractor were shot dead, and firing took place outside the residence-cum-clinic of a noted doctor in separate incidents in Vaishali district, the police said on Saturday.The incidents prompted Union Minister and Hajipur MP Ramvilas Paswan to attack Chief Minister Nitish Kumar claiming that “jungle raj was back” in the State.The body of ASI Ashok Kumar Yadav, who was on leave, was found in Manua village, Superintendent of Police Vaishali, Rakesh Kumar, said.The ASI was killed allegedly by unidentified men and the reason is yet to be ascertained, the SP said.Dr P N Jha of Sadar Hospital, who conducted the post-mortem, said four bullets were found on the body and the bullets appeared to be those used by the police.In another incident, sand contractor Himanshu Kumar was gunned down allegedly by unknown persons and his body was found near Bidupur bazar in the morning.Meanwhile, over 12 rounds of firing took place outside the residence-cum-clinic of a noted physician of Hajipur, Vivekanand Jha, at around 11 p.m. on Friday when the doctor was inside, Town Inspector Shankar Jha said.The incidents prompted Ram Vilas Paswan to attack the Nitish Kumar government claiming a string of killings showed that “jungle raj was back” and the Chief Minister was “helpless”.“There are three ministers from Vaishali region in Nitish government including two sons of RJD chief Lalu Prasad of whom one is also Deputy Chief Minister,” he said.“Still, all this is happening in Vaishali. What will happen to the security of people when the police are not safe in Bihar. Why the Chief Minister is so helpless and silent on all this,” Mr Paswan told PTI.The Union Minister will be visiting his constituency on Sunday to take stock of the situation.“He (Nitish) used to take pride in being called ‘Sushashan Babu’. Engineers, doctors and traders, even policemen are not safe here. There is no government in Bihar. Extortion is being done openly.“The situation in the State has become worse than what it was in 1990 when RJD ruled the State. When we used to say that jungle raj will be back if Lalu-Nitish combine came to power, they used to react strongly. See, jungle raj is back in such a short span of rule,” Mr Paswan said.
