A man has been ordered by a U.K. court to inform the police 24 hours before any sexual contact with a woman despite being cleared of rape as he poses a risk to public, and faces five years in jail for any breach.The man, in his 40s who has not been identified, was acquitted of raping a woman at a retrial in 2015 after claiming that the alleged victim had consented. He is also subject to controls on his use of the Internet and must declare to the North Yorkshire Police about every phone and device that he has that he could use for accessing the Internet or calling or texting people.Restrictions on till May 19The restrictions are part of an interim sexual risk order and will continue until May 19, when York Magistrates Court will decide whether to make it a full order.Under the interim order, if the man from the city of York in northern England plans to start a sexual relationship of any kind with a woman or to have one-off sexual activity, he has to contact the police â€” or if he moves to a different county, he needs to tell who the woman is.Breach can land him in jailFull sexual risk orders in England and Wales last for a minimum of two years and breaching an order can lead to a prison sentence of up to five years.These orders are used when someone has not been convicted of a sexual offence, but the police convince a court it is necessary for one to be made against the person to protect the public from him or her.Orders introduced in MarchSexual risk orders were introduced in England and Wales in March last year and can be applied to any individual who the police believe poses a risk of sexual harm, even if they have never been convicted of a crime.
