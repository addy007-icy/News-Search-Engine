Drought has taken a toll on the annual cattle fair being organised as part of the Siddeshwar Jatra near Torvi village in Vijayapura.Farmers from various parts of the district and neighbouring States, who have brought their cattle to the ‘jatra’, are finding it difficult to sell the animals in the absence of prospective buyers who are worried about the shortage of fodder.Though hundreds of heads of cattle have been brought to the fair from places such as Raibag, Jamkhandi and Athani in Belagavi and also from Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts, the farmers complain that they are not getting the expected prices.Below expectationsThe farmers say that the prices being offered were far below their expectations. “We have spent a lot on raising the animal and on transporting them. The money offered does not cover even the expenditure we have incurred, leave alone profit,” Narayan Shetagar, a farmer from Nalatwad village of Muddebihal taluk said.The organisers said that though the number of heads of cattle had increased by at least 10 per cent compared with the previous year, there was a dip in the sale.Meanwhile, two burly and masculine bulls have been attracting the crowd. Nagesh Rao of Siddapur village of Gangavati taluk of Koppal district has fixed their price at Rs. 9 lakh.ExpenditureClaiming that he spends about Rs. 15,000 a month on the bulls, Mr. Rao said that the five-year-old bulls can pull or lift over 5 tonnes of weight. Some people were found to be taking selfies with their ‘macho bulls’ on their mobile phones.
