Textile showrooms here are doing roaring business, thanks to surplus money among villagers following a bumper crop during the Sankranti season. Last year, farmers were not able to spend much owing to the impact of Hud-Hud.There was good yield this time in 4.8 lakh acres in the district. Although the government did not buy paddy from procurement centres, farmers could successfully sell it in the open market.That, in turn, helped textile establishments do good business. Places such as G.T. Road, Palakonda Raod and China Bazaar were jam-packed, with villagers turning up in large numbers to purchase clothes and essential commodities.“Fortunately, nature was kind this year, the reason why crop was abundant.“We managed to get loans easily from local lenders to meet our requirements during the Sankranti season,” said L. Lakshmi Naidu from Gara mandal.Meanwhile, more business is expected in the next few days. Several new showrooms were also opened in the town this year. It is estimated that textile business could be around Rs. 20 crore during the Sankranti season. In fact, it could be more, but the business of local shops got affected with the establishment of temporary outlets by major textile groups from Visakhapatnam.“A major chunk of business has gone to showrooms in Visakhapatnam. Those showrooms now have their outlets in hotels and function halls. They offer products at competitive prices. Naturally, customers opt for them,” said Y. Sankar, a textile showroom owner.The Srikakulam textile market depends mainly on the rural population, as elite sections prefer to do shopping in Visakhapatnam.Business establishments are concentrated on rural business, too, with their temporary showrooms in Srikakulam.Unlike last year, crop yield was good this season
