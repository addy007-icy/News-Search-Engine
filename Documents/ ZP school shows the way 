The Zilla Praja Parishad High School at Chandrampalem near Madhurawada will be saving its entire power bill by tapping renewable sources of energy.The State government has installed an 8,500 watt solar power unit and 1,500 watt wind power unit (totalling 10 kV) on the school premises at a cost of Rs. 10 lakh.The power generated is 1,200 kWh. With the average power consumption of the school being 1,100 units, it will have surplus power which it can contribute to the grid and be paid for it by the APEPDCL as there will be no power consumption during holidays.The school would save a power bill of Rs. 7,000 per month, said headmaster M. Raja Babu. The school is provided with solar and wind power as it has improved its infrastructure and academic record, thanks to mobilisation of funds and support from individuals such as retired additional SP T.S.R. Prasad.The school is selected for a pilot project under the Building As Learning Centre Aid Project of the State government and is now receiving a fresh coat of paint. The government’s programmes on education are being painted on the school’s walls. Two pairs of school uniforms are being provided to pupils of classes six, seven, and eight every year along with free textbooks. Haemoglobin test is being conducted for the pupils by the local PHC.
