Introduction of gender education in engineering colleges affiliated to the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU-Hyderabad) is a welcome step (“ >Telangana makes first State to make gender education compulsory,” Jan.11). I hope that it becomes a full-fledged programme in all States. Ideally, such a curriculum needs to be introduced to the students much earlier. By the time they reach under-graduation, students have their views and biases. That said, gender education will certainly lead to greater gender sensitisation for all.Ravi Meenu,Secunderabad
