There is a concerted effort to deny Dalits their Constitutional rights and demands for reservations in private sector is being countered by a campaign for removing reservations, Dalit Social Mukti Manch national convenor V. Srinivasa Rao has said.Delivering a talk at the 184th birth anniversary celebrations of Savitribai Phule organised by Kula Vivaksha Vyatireka Porata Samiti here on Saturday, he said even the media was biased against Dalits. While the demand for reservations by Patels in Gujarat hogged the headlines for long, there was hardly any mention of the demand by Dalits for quota in employment in private sector.‘Injustice in all fields’Injustice was being done to Dalits in education, health and employment due to apathetic implementation of laws by the ruling classes and officials, he said.Reservations must be based on principle of social justice, he added.Private sector that was acquiring vast tracts of public land at subsidy paid for by the tax payers and also getting funds from public sector banks, which too was public money, are refusing to serve the people and are opposing reservations in private sector, Mr Srinivasa Rao said.“Youth today are unaware of the extraordinary efforts by Savitribai Phule to provide education to the Dalits,” he said. Despite immense pressure from upper classes Savitribai Phule not only established a school for girls but also taught there, he recalled.Education was essential to empower women and help them question, writer Jaladi Vijaya said on the occasion. KVPS district president T. Chiranjeevi Rao, secretary R.V. Raju and M. Subba Rao, among others were present at the programme.
