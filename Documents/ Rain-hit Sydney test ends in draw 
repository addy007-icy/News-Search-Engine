The rain-hit third test between Australia and West Indies ended in a draw on the fifth and final day at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday, leaving the hosts with a 2-0 series victory.A draw was always the most likely result after all but 11 overs of day two and the entirety of days three and four were washed out — only the fifth time no play had been possible on two consecutive days of a test match in Australia.David Warner scored an 82-ball century on his way to 122 not out to help Australia to 176 for two when the players shook hands on a draw. He provided a rare highlight in a Test frequently marred by wet weather.Having waited five days to get to the crease, Warner wasted little time in asserting himself on the West Indies attack. He reached his half century off 42 balls with a six off Warrican and was within sight of his 16th test century at tea.Australia won the first test in Hobart by an innings and 212 runs before an equally dominant 177-run victory in the second test in Melbourne.Mitchell Marsh was unbeaten on 10 when a passing shower forced an early tea break.Jomel Warrican took the only wicket of the session, having Joe Burns caught by a leaping Kemar Roach at mid-on for 26.Before lunch, the West Indies was bowled out for 330, with Denesh Ramdin progressing to 62, four days after starting his innings on day one.After a delay of 45 minutes at the start of the day as the pitch was uncovered for the first time in three days, the West indies lower-order batsmen defied Australia’s attack for an hour and a half as the visitors recorded its highest innings total of the series.Denesh Ramdin was the third West Indian batsman to pass a half-century in the innings before swiping at a wide ball by Steve O’Keefe and being caught by Steve Smith at slip for 62.Nathan Lyon dismissed Kemar Roach (15) and O’Keefe had Jerome Taylor caught for 13 to end the innings.O’Keefe finished with 3-63 in his first Test in Australia.West Indies captain Jason Holder declined the opportunity to declare before play, meaning the match was drifting toward a draw in front of the few thousand fans who took advantage of free entry to the SCG.Persistent rain had washed out play from tea on day two, marking only the fifth occasion in more than a century of test cricket in Australia in which play was abandoned for two consecutive days because of rain.Both teams wore black armbands in memory of Baljit Chandrika, father of West Indies batsman Rajendra Chandrika, who passed away overnight. Opening batsman Chandrika featured in the first two tests of the series before sustaining a groin injury in the warm-up for the third Test.
