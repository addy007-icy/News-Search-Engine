Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) councillors staged a protest at Bhongir Municipality and demanded the resignation of chairperson, vice-chairperson and other councillors, who defected to Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS). If they really want to join the TRS, the councillors said they should resign to face the election again. Days before the local authorities MLC constituency election, as many as 15 municipal councillors from these three parties had switched loyalty to TRS. Prior to this development, the TRS was having no representation in the 30-member house. The house was meeting for the first time after 15 councillors, who include chairperson Survi Lavanya, defected to the TRS. From having no representation in the last meeting of the house, the TRS strength rose to 15. The municipal chairman was elected on BJP ticket. Demanding the resignation of the municipal chairperson and other councillors, the BJP, TDP and Congress councillors boycott the house.
