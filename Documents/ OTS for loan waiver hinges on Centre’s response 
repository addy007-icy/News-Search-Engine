In what is being seen as a political strategy, the Telangana Government that has initially planned to spare funds from recovery of commercial taxes dues and sale of lands for implementing one time settlement (OTS) of the remainder of crop loan waiver of Rs.8,300 crore is now banking its hopes on the Centre.“With most of the resources planned to be utilised for OTS initially being diverted to GHMC area ahead of the elections, the government appears to have changed its strategy to rely on the Centre for the purpose by pursuing for increase in its borrowing limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, even as less than three months time is left for the completion of the current financial year,” official sources told The Hindu .CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao has made no bones of his government’s intentions by making it clear a few days back that they have plans to implement OTS in the next fiscal only if the Centre agrees for raising the FRBM limit from the present 3 per cent of GSDP to 3.5 per cent, as recommended by the 14{+t}{+h}Finance Commission.
