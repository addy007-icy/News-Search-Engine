The Madras High Court has directed the District Collector to initiate action against encroachments of road in Mettur.The order comes following a Public Interest Litigation filed by Ramesh (35), a farmer of Mettur, stating that roads in Mettur were encroached upon. The petition said that a road measuring 36 feet was present from Mettur â€“ Salem Main Road to reach villages of Kandanur, Mettuthanapatti and Manganoor.The road was laid on the government land of 1.07 hectare. The petition said that a few encroached upon the road and constructed concrete houses thus shrinking the road width to just eight feet. Vehicle users could not use the road.Chief Justice of the Madras High Court Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana asked the Mettur Tahsildar to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit a report to the District Collector in a month.The judges also asked the Collector to submit action taken report to the court in three months.
