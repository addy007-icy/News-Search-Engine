As many as 250 students of Government Cotton Hill Lower Primary School here got the opportunity to read, learn and develop proficiency in English language with the aid of children’s books gifted by a Washington DC-based NGO.Teachers and volunteers will assist the children to read the books and do the interactive projects. After they finish reading the books, the children will be encouraged to return the books to the school so that others can access them. The innovative approach, The First Book Study Circle, was launched with the help of The First Book.org, the Washington-DC based Ngo, which has donated 10,000 Disney Children’s books to the children. The books reached the school through the Centre for Creative Excellence-India, a city-based NGO. CFCE-India has plans to offer more books to the students in the coming days.
