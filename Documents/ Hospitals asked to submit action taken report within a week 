Terming the series of shocking maternal deaths in Vani Vilas Hospital, Bengaluru, and Cheluvamba Hospital, Mysuru, in November as “unacceptable”, Minister of State for Medical Education Sharan Prakash Patil on Monday said he had given stern instructions to the hospitals to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.The Minister, who held a meeting with medical superintendents of both the hospitals and top officials from the department to discuss the investigation report into the deaths, admitted that inadequate facilities and lack of trained manpower in obstetrics ICU and labour rooms were the probable reasons for the deaths.“Although the report does not point towards negligence by doctors, we have taken note of the lapses pointed out by experts, who investigated into the deaths. We have asked the heads of both hospitals to file an action taken report (ATR) within a week,” he said.“While the ICU in Vani Vilas Hospital has four ventilators, the one in Cheluvamba has two. Same is the case with defibrillators, monitors, and infusion pumps. The hospitals have been asked to procure whatever equipment is required to ensure that patients are not put to hardship,” he said.When pointed out that lack of adequate equipment in tertiary care hospitals was not a recent phenomenon, the Minister said, “These hospitals have become a dumping ground for patients, who are referred after they have developed severe complications. Besides, there were a number of general holidays during the period (from November 7 to 17) when the deaths occurred,” he said.On the drug samples that have been found to be “not of standard”, the Minister said the drugs were not found to be the lethal dose.When asked how “not of standard” drugs had been supplied by the Karnataka State Drugs Logistics and Warehousing Society from where drugs for all government hospitals are procured, the Minister said, “It happens sometimes. A few batches go unnoticed.”
