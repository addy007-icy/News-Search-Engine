The Hero Indian Open will return to the prestigious and historic Delhi Golf Club for the 2016 edition.The tournament, which was first held in 1964, will be played from March 17-20. The championship will once again be tri-sanctioned by the Indian Golf Union, the Asian Tour and European Tour, and will carry a prize fund of USD 1.5 million.The Delhi Golf Club has played host to the Indian Open on 28 occasions since its inaugural staging in 1964.In 2015, it was won by India’s current superstar Anirban Lahiri. Lahiri became a champion, following a sudden death play-off at the Delhi Golf Club. That second win in three weeks saw Lahiri move into the World’s Top-50 and since then he has cemented his place among the world’s golfing elite.Finishing second at the 2013 and 2015 editions — there was no Indian Open in the calendar year 2014 because of a change in schedules — was SSP Chawrasia, now the second best Indian golfer in terms of World Ranking.Keith Waters, Chief Operating Officer of The European Tour, said: “We are delighted to be returning to the Delhi Golf Club for the 2016 Hero Indian Open. The Delhi Golf Club is one of many venues which make The European Tour’s International Schedule so diverse and we look forward to being part of another illustrious chapter in its rich history.”In the coming weeks, the entries will be coming in and as usual a very strong field is expected for the event.
