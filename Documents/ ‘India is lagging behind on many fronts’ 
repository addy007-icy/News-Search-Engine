The BJP-led NDA government has cut the allocations for education and health sector which would prove fatal to the country, observed social activist and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Sandip Pandey.Delivering the 5th PV Narasimha Rao Memorial Endowment lecture at Kakatiya University here on Wednesday, Mr Pandey said India was lagging behind on many fronts compared to Bangladesh and South Asian countries.“Even the share of women in Parliament is higher in Bangladesh than in India,” he pointed out.The women participation rate in the workforce is almost twice as high in Bangladesh as in India (57 % and 29% respectively). Many development experts in India, increasingly keen on private school education, would be interested to learn that in Sri Lanka, with its huge lead over India in social indicators, private schools have been banned in 1960s. “Sri Lank has achieved 99% literacy rate. In Sri Lanka few people live more than 1.4 km away from the nearest health centre,” Mr Pandey pointed out.Speaking on “the paradox of high growth and worst social indices in the world” he said that infant mortality rate in India was 47 per 1,000 live births whereas in China, Brazil and Russia it was 13, 14 and 10 per cent respectively. PV Memorial trust office bearers Surabhi Vani Devi, K Sitarama Rao, university registrar Prof Altaf Hussian, Parcha Kodandarama Rao, Dr V Viswanatha Rao were present.
