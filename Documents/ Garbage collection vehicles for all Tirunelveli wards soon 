The Tirunelveli Corporation plans to introduce battery-operated garbage collection vehicles in all the 55 wards.As per the present arrangement, the sanitary worker pushes the garbage collection trolley manually through the streets and blows a whistle. The residents, after segregating degradable and non-degradable waste at home, empty the garbage in the trolley.Since the sanitary workers face the risk of getting exposed to hazardous materials while handling the garbage collected from houses and business establishments, the Corporation has decided to replace the trolleys with battery-operated vehicles.“The sanitary worker who drives the vehicle will blow a whistle to alert the residents, who will dump the waste in the vehicle themselves. The quantum of risk or health hazard the sanitary worker faces gets minimised. Moreover, his self-esteem will certainly go up though he is collecting garbage,” said S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner.Rs. 2.50 lakh eachThe company fabricating it has supplied a vehicle, costing Rs. 2.50 lakh, to the civic body to use it on a trial basis.“Our sanitary workers use it to clear garbage from Tirunelveli Junction bus stand and Venthankulam new bus stand. It’s good and effective,” said a sanitary inspector of Thatchanallur Zone.As the Corporation plans to buy 55 vehicles, the cost of the vehicle is likely to come down.
