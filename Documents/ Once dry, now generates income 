The stalls marketing fish on the bund of the renovated Mookanery lake in the city are doing brisk business of late, thanks to the availability of copious water and abundant catch of fish.These temporary fish stalls were not functioning for a few years due to the Mookanery lake remaining dry.The volunteers of Salem Citizens Forum, taking advantage of the dry lake bed cleaned it.With the western districts experiencing widespread rainfall in the last two months, the lake received copious inflow of water.At present the lake is almost full.Fishermenâ€™s association which had taken the lake on lease for fishing activities dropped about three lakh fingerlings of logu, kendai, katla, billu kendai, and kuravai varieties into the lake last month.Now the fingerlings have grown to fishes each weighing about 2 kg.The fishermen are now selling fresh fish on the bund.The sales picked up in no time and people from different parts of the city make a beeline for procuring the fresh water fish, both alive and dressed.The crowd gets doubled during the weekends.Long queues of consumers in front of the stalls is a common sight on Saturdays and Sundays.The fish is very tasty, and hence is the demand, says S. Maninathan of Kannankurichi, a frequent visitor to these fish stalls.
