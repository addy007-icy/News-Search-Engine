District Congress Minority Cell, led by its chairman Sumeer Ahmed, urged the Collector here on Monday to take initiative to severely punish the accused persons who raped two Muslim minor girls at different villages and sanction ex-gratia and other benefits to the victims.Handing over a memorandum to the Collector Yogitha Rana, the Muslim minority leaders said that a class 9 student was allegedly raped in Ergatla village of Morthad mandal two years ago. Though representation was made four times, the girl was not granted ex-gratia, they said. Similarly, another Muslim minor girl studying in class 9 was allegedly raped at Bodepally village under Balkonda police station limits on December 31 by a 23-year-old man named Naresh. Both the girls belong to poor families and therefore they need to be provided with relief immediately, they said.The police should register a case under the Nirbhaya Act and punish them severely. Passport of the accused must also be seized forthwith, as he was likely to escape to Gulf countries, they said.Emerging from the Collectorâ€™s office, the minority cell leaders Syed Nazeeb Ali and Mr. Sumeer Ahmed told reporters that the Collector responded positively to sanction an ex-gratia of Rs. 6 lakh each to the two victims, two bed room houses and government jobs. Congress floor leader in Municipal Corporation of Nizamabad M.A. Quddus and leaders Akbar Nawazuddin and Syed Aslam were also present.A class 9 student was allegedly raped in Ergatla village two years ago, another Muslim minor girl was allegedly raped at Bodepally village on December 31
