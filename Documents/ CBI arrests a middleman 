The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested a middleman for accepting a bribe of Rs.60,000 for some officials of the Assistant Director General of Foreign Trade (ADGFT) in Ludhiana.The agency received a complaint from the owner of an auto-parts manufacturing company alleging that some ADGFT officials were demanding bribe.The complainant initially received a demand notice directing him to either submit documents showing fulfilment of necessary export obligations or, within 30 days, pay custom duty exemption availed by him on imported goods apart from an interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum.When the company representatives sought clarification from the officials, they directed them to contact a middleman named Puneet. The alleged middlemen demanded Rs.80,000 to get the demand notice cancelled. Through negotiation, the amount was scaled down to Rs.60,000.Based on the complaint, the CBI laid a trap and arrested Puneet when he was allegedly accepting the bribe amount, following which searches were carried out on his premises.The CBI has registered a corruption case against unknown ADGFT officials and initiated investigations for identification of those involved.
