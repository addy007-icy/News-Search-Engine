Railway commuters, who are sick of stinking toilets and dirty coaches, have some reason to cheer.Coaches of long-distance trains originating from various cities under South Western Railway Zone are comparatively cleaner now, thanks to ‘On-Board House-Keeping Service’ (OBHS) scheme.More trains will have this facility and the numbers will hit 50 by June this year.South Western Railway Zone has 25 railway stations under ‘comprehensive mechanised cleaning’ scheme and also has a ‘clean train station’ concept where express trains with over 20 minutes stoppage are cleaned.However, the long-distance trains continue to have complaints, which are being addressed by the OBHS.The housekeeping staff travel on the train to ensure that the coaches are cleaned twice a day. “They also have to take up unscheduled cleaning when passengers demand it,” said Deputy General Manager (G) and Chief Public Relations Officer, SWR, Ghanshyam Verma. A passenger can send an sms in a given format and ask for cleaning service. “Soon after the message is sent, the onboard housekeeping team is alerted to address the complaint. Meanwhile, the complainant receives a code which he has to provide to the housekeeping staff if he is satisfied with the cleaning. The complaint is considered as closed only when the staffer keys in this code obtained from the complainant,” he said. The SWR has a feedback mechanism in place, which is considered while making payment to the housekeeping agency, to which the work is outsourced.SWR had the permission to introduce OBHS in 37 trains in the last fiscal and it introduced it in 13 trains. This year, it has permission for 50 trains and has implemented it in 25 trains. “The tender for eight more will be finalised this month-end, and by June we will have OBHS in all the 50 permitted trains,” Mr. Verma said.
