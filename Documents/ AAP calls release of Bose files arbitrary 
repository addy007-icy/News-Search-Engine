The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday warned against the selective declassification of documents related to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, saying the arbitrary release of files smacked of political opportunism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday released 100 files about the freedom fighter’s life, including a letter written by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1945 to then British Prime Minister Clement Attlee where he appears to have called Bose a “war criminal”. “We want the letter to be probed. We know that our freedom fighters had political and ideological differences, but they respected each other. Doubting their integrity based on selective facts would not only be unfair to them, but also set a dangerous trend,” said AAP leader Ashutosh. He added that the BJP “should refrain from politics of hatred” for their own short-term goals. The AAP also demanded that the Centre should institutionalise the process of declassifying the files about Bose, instead of arbitrary releases. Mr. Ashutosh said: “The BJP should be warned against the politics of showing heroes of the freedom struggle in a poor light by selectively using facts from history books and circulating stories about differences between them.”
