Federation of Medical Representatives of India State president P. Kameswara Rao on Sunday opposed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in pharmaceutical companies, multiple taxation on medicines, the proposed modification in the Patent Act, demanding that corporate corruption be checked.The government announced that 35 per cent of the medicines available in the market were spurious and sub-standard, but it was not initiating any deterrent action, he said while addressing the media here. Medicine prices were not being regulated under the Drug Price Control Order and the trend led to steep pricing of essential medicines, he said. Despite a stipulation to mandatorily produce 40 per cent of essential drugs, most pharma firms were not following it, he said.
