The third and final match of the upcoming Twenty20 series between India and Australia will turn pink to support the McGrath Foundation after rain washed out a large part of the annual Pink Test here.The McGrath Foundation set a fund-raising total of 380,000 dollars for the Sydney Pink Test between Australia and the West Indies — enough to fund one McGrath Foundation Breast Care Nurse for three years — but due to rain, the fund-raising fell short of the target.“The Foundation’s biggest fund-raising day, Jane McGrath Day (named after Glenn McGrath’s late wife) — day three of the Test — was hit particularly hard by the rain, leading to the least-attended Jane McGrath Day since its inception in 2009,” Cricket Australia said in a statement.The Twenty20 series between will start on January 26 in Adelaide.Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said the Pink Test had a goal to raise 380,000 dollars for the McGrath Foundation but the weather prevented it from reaching the total.“Despite the constant rain, the cricket community still showed strong support during the Pink Test, helping raise more than 250,000 dollars,” he said.“While we can’t control the weather, we do have other international matches ahead, and the third KFC T20 International at the SCG on January 31 will be used to raise important funds and awareness for the McGrath Foundation,” he added.“The match is close to a sell-out, giving thousands of cricket fans the chance to again support this important cause by wearing pink.”The January 31 match marks the return of T20 Internationals to the SCG.Fans will be encouraged to again wear pink to bath the ground in pink as it would have been on day three of the Test.
