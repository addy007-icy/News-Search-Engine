On a day that 15 more student deportees landed in Hyderabad, K.T. Ramarao, Minister for IT and Panchayati Raj, shot a letter to Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj seeking intervention in the matter.In the letter, Mr. Rao expresses his concerns to MEA about the mass deportation. “Many students in India take loans to fund their education programme in U.S. varsities. And when the students are deported back to India, their families pass through deep emotional and financial anguish,” the Minister’s letter read.The letter also sought clarity on why students with valid visas were being sent back to the country. Traditionally, the city of Hyderabad has had a maximum share in sending students and skilled workforce to the US. “There seems to be no clarity on why the US officials are using highhanded methods to deport these students. Also, there have been media reports where the students were mistreated by the US authorities,” the Minister pointed out.Mr. Rao in his letter also requested the MEA to focus on initiating dialogue with the concerned US departments to stop the immigration distress caused to Indian students.
