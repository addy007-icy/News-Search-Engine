Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) personnel on Saturday nabbed two woodcutters from Tamil Nadu, and seized the carcass of a spotted deer, rice bags, axes and machetes at a stream bed in Seshachalam forest.A combing party of the RSASTF, including armed guards, was combing the Seshachalam Hills at Srivarimettu, 15 km from Tirupati, when they spotted a small group of woodcutters.On close observation, the combing party found that the woodcutters were carrying the carcass of a spotted deer tied to wooden poles.Spotting the commotion from behind, the woodcutters threw away their belongings, including rice, carcass.While fleeing, one of the woodcutters flung a machete at a constable, but he escaped unhurt.

Bhaskar and Deputy Range Officer Vijay Kumar of the Task Force overpowered two of the woodcutters - Ramesh Babu and Ayyappa of Jawadu Hills of Tiruvannamalai district of TN - who were later handed over to forest officials.Speaking to the media, Ramesh Babu said the deer was caught in the buffer zone abutting the SV Zoo Park, 5 km from Paruveta Mandapam (where the woodcutters were caught) with the help of a noose at dawn.To stop the animal from calling, its neck was broken, resulting in its death instantaneously.“We were caught while carrying the carcass towards a hillock. Some of our men had reached there and were making arrangements for cooking the meat,” he said, adding that their plan was to venture into the forests for felling red sanders trees after packing the cooked meat and rice.Regular routeThe regular route of the woodcutters was to enter the Tirumala hills at Srivarimettu, and later deep inside through Paruveta Mandapam.Special teamMeanwhile, a special team of the Task Force rushed into the deep forests in search of the escaped woodcutters.
