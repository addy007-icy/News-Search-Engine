After a lull for about a month, work on providing service road has resumed recently near the bridge in Lalgudi. The work suffered a setback as a large number of electric poles needed to be shifted from the middle of the service road, which runs to 900 metres on either side of the bridge, to the corner of the road.Traders have voluntarily demolished a part of their complex at the entrance. The traders have demolished part of their double and three-stroeyed buildings to facilitate the construction.The objective of the construction of the bridge and the service road will be realised, only if the traffic island is set up at the of the Tiruchi-Lalgudi stretch near the bus stand.Traffic snarls continue to be a nightmare for the road users as a large number of buses, school vans, and trucks cross this point. According to official sources, a traffic island with a diameter of 20 metres has been designed as part of the bridge. “But the delay in acquisition of land at this site has been posing a bottleneck in constructing the island,” the source told The Hindu on Friday.Although the bridge has been thrown open to light vehicles and four-wheelers, it is not open to heavy vehicles.“What all we do — including the work on service road, aims at maximum utilisation of available period of project,” the source said indicating the immediate need for setting up the traffic island.At present, traffic police have a tough time in regulating the vehicles. Buses and trucks from Ariyalur, Tiruchi and other vehicles entering the Lalgudi town converge at this junction.
