: For most bus commuters in the city, there is no escape from the scorching heat. Due to lack of proper shelters at many bus stops, they have no option but to brave the blazing sun. The Corporation’s promise of modern bus shelters at seven places, announced in 2012-13, remains only on papers.The commuters say that the problem is perennial as the Corporation, the highways or the district administration have failed to take steps to erect shelters in the city bus stops. Some of the bus stops in the city that are in need of shelters are located on Yercaud Main Road, Five Road, Four Road, Three Road, Thiruvakavundanur Bypass, Thirumagal Bypass, Kondalampatti roundtana, Seelanaickenpatti, Ponammapet, Attur Main Road and opposite to New Bus Stand.A few commuters also complained that at a few places, the shelters are either occupied by beggars or hawkers.Another problem is the absence of high mast lamps or street lights near bus stops. “It is difficult for elderly people and women to wait for long in the bus stops during night hours,” V. Chitra from Sankari said.In case of National Highways, the entire stretch from Seelanaickenpatti to Periyar University does not have bus shelters and commuters have to wait on the highway or stand on the median.“The worst affected are commuters waiting at Thiruvakavundanur Bypass, Kondalampatti and Seelanaickenpatti. A lot of people board buses to other cities from these places,” M. Gunaseelan, a worker, said.
