Uttarakhand launched an astounding comeback to record a 71-69 victory over Tamil Nadu in the men's semifinal of the Senior national basketball championship, here on Friday.Uttarakhand, the defending champion, found itself down by 18 points with a little over seven minutes to go. A Tamil Nadu win was all but guaranteed, but Vishesh Bhrighuvanshi and his men refused to give up.Point guard Riyazuddin started the roll by sinking two three-pointers, followed by another couple of maximums from a Trideep Rai. Trideep's double blow brought the deficit down to just two points, with 45 seconds left on the clock. Centre Murali Krishna then stayed strong under the ring to score, tying the game at 69.A little less than 20 seconds remained, and a panicky Tamil Nadu turned the ball over - in the centre circle - to Uttarakhand and India skipper Bhrighuvanshi. The forward stayed calm, hustled his way to the key, and converted a lay-up with his left hand.Tamil Nadu ball-handler Akilan missed a tough shot on the final play, and his side was knocked out. The defeated hoopsters - many in tears - left the arena in a state of shock.Services, meanwhile, proved too good for Punjab in the other semifinal. The two teams were evenly matched for the first three quarters, but some timely buckets from Narendra Grewal took Services over the hump.In the first women's semifinal, a strong show from Railways took out Telangana 78-50. Railways displayed superior teamwork, and benefitted from plenty of fast-breaks and full-court presses. It was all too much to handle for Telangana, which exited with a whimper.Railways will face Kerala in the summit clash, which will be held at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium on Saturday.
