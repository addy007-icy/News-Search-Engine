BJP leader Subramanian Swamy wants the government to approach the Supreme Court seeking a day-to-day hearing of the pending civil appeals on the ownership of the disputed land in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque once stood.The appeals are against the verdict of the Allahabad HC on the Ayodhya title suit. “I feel that it is appropriate that our government, specially its Law Officers, approach the Supreme Court with an application seeking day-to-day hearing on the Ram Janmabhoomi issues and pray that the Supreme Court gives its verdict on Civil Appeals as early as possible,” Dr. Swamy says in his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The development comes at a time when the VHP has also been making a pitch for expediting the process for the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya.Dr. Swamy reminded Mr. Modi of an affidavit filed by the Narasimha Rao government. “The Narasimha Rao government, in which I also held a Cabinet rank position, had given an affidavit to the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court that if there was a pre-existing temple where Babri Masjid stood, then the government will be in favour of handing over the Ram Janmabhoomi land to the Hindus to build the Ram temple. Now… it has been established by the ASI that indeed there was such a temple,” his letter says.
