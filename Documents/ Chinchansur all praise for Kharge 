Minister for Textiles and Inland Ports, Baburao Chinchansur, has confessed that though he had represented the Chitapur Assembly constituency for three consecutive terms, he could not take up development works there. The people of the constituency could enjoy the benefits of development only after M Mallikarjun Kharge was chosen from the constituency in 2008.“Chitapur Assembly constituency is witnessing a golden era now after Mr. Kharge was elected from the constituency in 2008 and later his son Prayank Kharge in 2013,” he said at a function at Chitapur on Monday.Mr. Chinchansur said that even when he was a Minister in the S.M. Krishna government, there was widespread criticism that the constituency had remained backward.
