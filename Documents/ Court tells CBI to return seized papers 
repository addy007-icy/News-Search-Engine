Special court for CBI cases on Wednesday directed the investigating agency to return to the Delhi government certain documents seized during the raid at the office of its Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar in connection with a corruption case last month.The government had sought back these documents from the CBI, arguing that they were unrelated to and unnecessary for the investigation of the case against the senior officer and others.Ordering the investigating agency to hand over the original documents to the government, Special Judge A.K. Jain said: “Despite one month of the seizure of the documents, the CBI could not categorically state that these documents relate to the present case.”The court also dismissed an argument by the CBI that there could be any forgery in these documents, saying that “this argument on its face appears baseless considering the nature of the documents i.e. diaries or the files”.“On a specific inquiry by this court, they (CBI) are unable to point out the forgery and nor are ready to commit this argument in the writing,’’ Special CBI Judge Ajay Kumar Jain observed.“The CBI is not ready to disclose during arguments any reason before this court for what purpose they require the documents. They have taken only a vague plea that the investigation is going on at the desired pace,” the court said.“The acceptance of the vague reasons like investigation is still in progress implies that the CBI is recognised with unbridled power to investigate, even in violation of the relevant laws and regulations,” the court said, pulling up the investigating agency.“The CBI is directed to return the documents in original. However, CBI is at liberty to retain photocopies of these documents and to inspect the originals at any point of time by visiting the applicant’s (Delhi Government) office,” the Judge stated.
