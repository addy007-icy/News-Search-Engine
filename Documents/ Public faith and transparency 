: From retrieval of organs to transplantation, the entire process must be transparent and placed within the public domain. “There is huge money involved, and public faith in the system is important,” Dr. Gracious says.“It is not enough if the public are informed only about retrieval and transplantation of organs. It is very important to let the public know about the outcome of transplantation, whether the recipient survived,” he points out.Hospitals cannot claim success immediately after the transplantation, and that includes going to the media before verifying whether the donated organs have established compatibility with the recipient.The Transplantation of Human Organs Act clearly says that the identity of the recipient cannot be revealed, even to the family of the brain-dead person whose organs have been donated. This rule applies to the media as well. The donor’s name and photo are published in order to appreciate and promote organ donation.Unfortunately, in many cases, the recipient is paraded before the media and in some cases an elaborate press conference is held at which the families of the donor and recipient are brought together for a photo opportunity.“We had come across an instance of the family of a donor contacting the recipient of a liver and asking for monetary help. Revealing the identity of the recipient could, advertently or inadvertently, lead to such acts,” Dr. Gracious said.
