Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao on Wednesday reviewed the temple management’s ambitious programme of developing 100 lakes in the temple city. Interacting with officials of Forest, Engineering and Estates Departments along with TTD Joint Executive Officer (Tirupati) Pola Bhaskar, Mr. Rao said the environs around the lakes should be developed in such a way that they should offer an aesthetic feel to pilgrims. “A walking path should be developed around water bodies without disturbing its original form. This should be complemented by sound systems playing Govinda Namas,” he added.
