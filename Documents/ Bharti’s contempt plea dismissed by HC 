The Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition moved by the AAP leader Somnath Bharti. The petition had sought initiation of contempt proceedings against the police officials for their failure to file a reply before a trial court in a case of alleged molestation of some African women.The Delhi Police had filed a final report against Mr. Bharti and 17 other accused in the case registered after his controversial raid on the African women on the intervening night of January 15-16, 2014, when he was Law Minister in the AAP government. Mr. Bharti had claimed bias in investigation and sought further probe. After a Single Judge Bench of the HC dismissed his contempt petition on December 17, 2015, Mr. Bharti moved the Division Bench against the verdict. The Bench said the petition was correctly dismissed by the Single Judge. Mr. Bharti had contended, the trial court had noted 13 defects in the investigation and had directed the police to file a reply, seeking further probe. The Single Judge Bench held that the act of police officials of not filing reply did not constitute civil contempt.
