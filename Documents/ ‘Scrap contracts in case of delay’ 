Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao on Sunday ordered termination of contracts of those contractors who were delaying works related to the Mission Kakatiya programme. Dealing with the the problem at a video conference with Irrigation Department officials, he asked officials to hand over the works to new contractors subsequently. Talking about quality in work, the Minister said quality control officers should be appointed for every tank being taken up under the programme. He warned officials of action in case of compromise in quality of work. Mr. Rao instructed officials to complete pending works from the first phase of the programme by March 31 and initiate tender process for the second phase works. In Adilabad district, about 41 works were ending from the 560 in the first phase, and officials proposed 535 more in the second phase this year.
