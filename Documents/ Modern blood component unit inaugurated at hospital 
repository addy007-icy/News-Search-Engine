Minister for Social Justice and Panchayats M.K. Muneer inaugurated the state-of-the-art Blood Component Separation Unit at the Government Women and Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Kottapparamba here on Saturday.The unit was set up with the help of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society renovating an old building at the hospital compound at a cost of Rs 1 crore.Steps to set up the unit started in 2011, as part of the proceedings to get NABH accreditation to the hospital.However, it got delayed due to technical glitches involving getting power connection to the blood bank, even though the installation of most of the equipment was completed three years ago.Delay in getting the Central government licence too was a hurdle.The unit houses equipment such as blood bank refrigerators, plasma expresser, laminar air flow chambers and refrigerated centrifuge.With a capacity to store 195 units of blood at a time, it is the second blood component separation unit in government sector in the district. Patients from Below Poverty Line families admitted at the hospital as well as other government hospitals shall avail blood free of cost from the Blood Bank here.Outsiders will have to pay a nominal fee, while a unit of blood costs from Rs.1,000 to Rs. 1,500 in the private sector.The blood component separation unit ensures optimum use of every unit of blood available by separating it to components such as plasma, platelets, erythrocytes (red blood cells) and white blood cells.
