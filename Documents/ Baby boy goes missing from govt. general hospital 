The incident took place at the paediatrics ward and was immediately brought to the notice of the hospital staff.The police suspect that it could be the handiwork of an organised gang, since the woman, who was earlier seen in the ward talking to the grandmother of the boy, was not the same as the elderly woman who was seen on CCTV carrying the infant out of the ward.Grainy CCTV images showed an elderly woman walk out of the ward at 7 am, but the police said that the image of the woman was not clear.The baby boy was admitted on Tuesday by his grandmother Hussainbi, a resident of Rentachintala village, following respiratory illness.Resident Medical Officer Ramesh said that the grandmother was befriended by a 35-year-old woman in the ward. The woman had even slept in the ward and in the morning, asked the woman to leave the infant with her while the latter could go to the wash room.The woman, who returned from the wash room, was shocked when she noticed that both her grandson and the woman who was talking to her were missing.A police complaint was lodged and the Kothapet police were investigating the case. “We guess that it is the handiwork of an organised gang. The boy is not well and we are also worried over his future,” said the RMO.Police suspect it is the handiwork of an organised gang
