A leopard cub found trapped on the Delhi-Gurgaon border last month is making speedy recovery at a rescue facility in Agra.“Following its rescue from Tikli village near the Delhi-Gurgaon border, the female cub is making progressive recovery at our rescue facility in Agra,” said a release issued by Wildlife SOS on Wednesday.The police had alerted Wildlife SOS about the cub.The animal was rescued soon after with assistance from the Forest Department and subjected to a medical examination.“The leopard’s front right limb was completely crushed, with multiple fractures on the radius and humerus. The cub was understandably in a state of severe distress and cried constantly through the examination,” said officials from Wildlife SOS.The cub now weighs 13.5 kg and is slowly regaining a proper appetite.“In addition to this, her soft tissue injury has healed. However, since she is a growing playful stage she was getting fidgety with her plaster and would occasionally tear it. The bone wound will take some more time to heal,” noted Wildlife SOS.
