Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Wednesday said Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samithi leader Rajan Babu’s functioning styles were not in accordance with the United Democratic Front’s proclaimed stand.Replying to presspersons’ questions here, Mr. Chandy said Mr. Babu’s hobnobbing with SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan was untenable and could not be justified. Mr. Babu’s reasoning was merely technical and in politics, the dividing line should be maintained, Mr. Chandy said, virtually signalling the exit of the JSS leader. However, the UDF will take a joint decision on whether he should continue in the coalition, Mr. Chandy said.With regard to the CPI (M)’s “détente” with the RSS, Mr. Chandy said he had questioned the sincerity of the CPI (M) leaders by referring to their association with the erstwhile Jana Sangh in the post-Emergency period when the people of the State voted in favour of the UDF. He reiterated his statement that he supported the CPI (M)-RSS talks if it was intended to end political violence.He dismissed the CPI (M) leaders’ allegations that he was promoting political violence, pointing out that all through his career he had never promoted the cult of violence at any stage.
