The Rs 74.10-crore drinking water supply improvement scheme had become operational in a full-fledged manner in the town with the inauguration of four Elevated Level Service Reservoirs (ELSRs) and a master balancing reservoir at various localities under the Municipal Corporation limits on Wednesday.According to sources, the scheme would ensure drinking water to a population of 2.52 lakh in the old municipal town limits on a daily basis. The project was originally designed keeping in view the drinking water needs of residents of the town, when it was a municipality over four years ago. The civic authorities had subsequently submitted a detailed project report at an estimated cost of Rs 340 crore to the government for catering to the drinking water needs of residents of the gram panchayats, those merged with the Khammam municipal corporation a few years ago.Minister for Roads and Buildings T Nageswara Rao formally inaugurated four ELSRs — one each at NSP Camp, Pakabanda Bazar, Parikamukkala Colony and Jammi Banda (Khilla) — besides a 6000kl master balancing reservoir at Ranganayakula Gutta here.Later, the Minister laid foundations for various road widening and other developmental works in the town.
