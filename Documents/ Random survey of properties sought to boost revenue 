Property tax is calculated under the Self Assessment Scheme (SAS) in Mysuru since 2002. However, there is no way of ascertaining if the declarations filed by the property owners are correct and this could be hurting the Mysuru City Corporation’s revenue.“The MCC should do a random survey of properties to ensure that the declarations in the SAS forms are true as a few may be suppressing details or under quoting to reduce tax,” R. Chandra Prakash, president, Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP), said.Though, SAS was introduced in 2002, the MCC was not doing a regular sample survey, he said. Besides, there are areas from which tax is not collected at all and the entire system was archaic, he added.The MGP, which flayed the MCC for its inept tax collection system, said a web-based payment system should also have been in vogue to ease the tax payment system.“It has been years since the MCC was promising online payment facility … but has been unable to get the web-based system in place … other departments have already done so,” Mr. Prasad said.Mayor B.L. Bhyrappa said that the online property tax calculator had to be updated and he would pay attention to it and help streamline the tax payment system so as to enhance efficiency.On the suggestions to increase the rentals of the commercial properties owned by the MCC, the Mayor said it was low compared to the prevailing market rate but the Corporation had to levy rentals as per the government norms and could not expect market or commercial rates. “The rentals are hiked once in three years though it is nominal,” he said.As per the official list, there are 60 government hostels, 24 libraries, 30 commercial complexes, 87 State and Union government offices, 188 mobile towers, 24 post offices, 13 government associations and 12 messes.MCC Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath pointed out that Mysuru had a large number of government offices some of which pay only service tax and do not pay property taxes.Besides, efforts to levy property tax on mobile towers has been put on hold as there was no clarity on the legality of it.There is no way to ascertain if the declarations filedby the property owners are correct
