The Telangana unit of the YSR Congress has decided not to field its nominees in the forthcoming elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.The party has instead decided to wait till the dissatisfaction against the government increases, providing an opportune time for the YSRC to reach out to the people.In the meantime, it was decided to strengthen the party from the grass-root level in Telangana, and efforts would be intensified accordingly.The YSRC alleged that the TDP, which was in power in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the BJP, which was in power at the Centre, and the Congress had taken the elections as a prestigious affair and were prepared to spend huge amounts to win the polls.The Congress has failed to expose the government’s failures to implement its promises, inordinate delays in completion of irrigation projects in the name of redesigning, and obstacles created in the implementation of the fee reimbursement scheme for students.‘YSRC playing effective Opposition’The TDP, on its part, was caught red-handed in the cash-for-vote scam and hence struck an understanding with the TRS. The YSRC was playing the role of an effective Opposition, highlighting people’s issues.Thanks to the efforts made by former Chief Minister late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy to alleviate the plight of poorer sections in Telangana, there were scores of sympathisers to the YSRC in the State.The party had accordingly decided to concentrate on rallying them together to emerge as a formidable force in Telangana in the coming days.
