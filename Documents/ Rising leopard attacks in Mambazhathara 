A series of leopard raids in the remote Mambazhathara village, near Thenmala, in Kollam district have put people of the area in distress.The latest in this connection was on Thursday night when a leopard killed a calf owned by Mani, a KSRTC employee.The villagers say a single large leopard is behind these raids.Mani said that during the past one month all his three dogs were lifted one by one by the leopard and now the calf too has been taken away. The leopard even ate half its kill in the courtyard of Mani’s house after dragging the calf out of the shed.He said he saw the big cat running away that night when he opened the widow of the house on hearing dogs barking in the distance.At least 17 domestic dogs from the village had been preyed upon by the leopard from Mambazhathara during the past several weeks.But it was the first time a calf had been preyed upon in recent months, Mani said.Mambazhathara village sits inside the sprawling rubber plantations of Harrisons Malayalam Limited.The plantation is on the edge of thick forests coming under the Pathanapuram forest range. Villagers now fear that unless the leopard is trapped and located elsewhere, their livestock could become easy prey for the straying leopard. Being a large plantation, the whole area offered enough cover for the cat to remain undetected whenever it strayed into the village for preying on domestic animals, the villagers said.Veterinary surgeons arrived on Friday at Mani’s house to conduct the autopsy. Mani would have to submit their report to the forest range office to get compensation from the government. But the amount paid was too little, he said.The villagers said that they would now join hands to trap the leopard.At least 17 domestic dogs from the village have been killed by the leopard so far.
