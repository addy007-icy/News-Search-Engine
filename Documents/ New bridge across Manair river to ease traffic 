The long-cherished dream of another bridge across river Manair to ease traffic congestion on the busy road from Karimnagar to Hyderabad and Warangal has been fulfilled, with the State government sanctioning a four-lane road from Housing Board colony to Sadashivapalli village of Manakondur mandal.Karimnagar legislator Gangula Kamalakar, who had been crusading for the sanction of another road and bridge across river Godavari on the outskirts of the town, has succeeded in the sanction of a new four-lane road for the smooth passage of traffic from Karimnagar town to Hyderabad and Warangal. Presently, the availability of only one road at Alugunur crossroads to proceed towards Hyderabad and Warangal was causing several traffic snarls.Disclosing this to newsmen here on Monday, Mr. Kamalakar thanked Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for sanctioning the road by issuing G.O. Rt no. 2 dated January 4, 2016. He said that the completion of the road across the river would reduce the distance by 7.5 kilometres and also traffic jams.He said that the four-lane road would be laid from Kaman crossroads to Housing Board colony, the bridge across the river connecting to Sadashivapalli village of Manakondur mandal. He said that the administrative sanction for the road was given at a cost of Rs. 77 crore, and added that the cost may escalate as the government was planning to construct a suspension bridge across the river.He said that the tender for the road works would be completed within one month, and the project in another year and a half. He said that he would fulfil his promise of giving a facelift to all the R&B roads in the town at a cost of Rs. 46 crore, which was sanctioned by the Chief Minister earlier.
