Urmila Satyanarayanan is known for her energetic movements and footwork, and her performance once again brought to the fore these elements of her style. After Pushpanjali, she took up Bharati’s ‘Oli Padaitha Kanninai Vaa Vaa Vaa.’ While doing the sancharis for this song, her portrayal of the travails one experiences during natural calamities was relevant and evocative in the aftermath of the Chennai experience, thereby establishing an emotional rapport with the viewer.The classic Thanjavur Quartet’s Anandabhairavi varnam, ‘Sakhiye Indha Velaiyil,’ was the centrepiece. The entreaties of the nayika to her friend and confidante about her lovelorn state, was conveyed with apt sancharis. The abhinaya for this varnam conveyed the essence of the song, but the dancer could have delved deeper for a stronger impact.The korvais composed by Karaikudi Krishnamoorthy for each segment of the varnam were long and disturbed the mood of the song.The sancharis for each line of the virutham ‘Oru Sevi Kettalum’ were well portrayed. ‘Enna Kavi Paadinaalum’ was full of bhakti bhava.Everything old need not be relevant and Urmila should have understood this before taking up a song such as ‘Kayil Rokka Panam Keladi’ in Atana. The song might have been a part of the devadasi tradition, but to take it up for a contemporary stage performance is unwarranted, and mature dancers should refrain from doing so. The explicit lyrics and the ideas expressed therein were unaesthetic.Shrikant’s singing was melodic but not inspired. Kalaiarasan (violin), Guru Bharadwaj (mridangam), Shridhar (flute) and Sai Kripa Prasanna (cymbals) complemented his singing.
