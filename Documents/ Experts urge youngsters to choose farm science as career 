To encourage more and more students to opt for agriculture as their main subject of study and make a career in farm science, the National Rice Research Institute (NRRI) here observed ‘Agriculture Education Day’ in its campus on Monday.More than 200 students from different city schools participated in the day-long activities which included a quiz and an exhibition on the theme “Energy Efficient Rural Agricultural Production System”, where the participants exhibited several innovative models.The debate competition held on the topic “Transforming Farming into Commercial Ventures -- Possibilities and Barriers”, evoked a lot of enthusiasm where participants talked about the recent drought in the State and its consequence leading to a spurt in farmers’ suicides.Joining as guests of honour in the inaugural session, Vice-Chancellor and Director of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) Dr Trilochan Mohapatra and senior IPS officer Asit Panigrahi in their addresses talked about different lucrative career options open to a farm science student.Calling upon the young brains to choose farm science as their main subject of study, Dr. Mohapatra said agriculture not only provides social and political stability to a nation, it maintains the sovereignty of the nation as well.
