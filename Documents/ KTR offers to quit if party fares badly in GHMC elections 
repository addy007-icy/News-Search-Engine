Information Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao has said that he will resign if the TRS fails to win the post of mayor in the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.He dared the Opposition, particularly TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and Telangana BJP president G. Kishan Reddy, to accept his challenge. With victory in 100 wards, the TRS would stand first, MIM second and BJP third. The Congress would not even win 10 seats, he told a meet-the-press programme organised by Telangana Union of Working Journalists.Mr. Rao spoke on these lines in response to a question whether the election results would be a referendum on the performance of the 18-month-old TRS government. To a question on his political ambitions, Mr. Rao said he did not aspire for Chief Ministership even in his dreams as he considered the post of Minister too big for him.
