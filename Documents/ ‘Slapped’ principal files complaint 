The outgoing principal of a private school in Sarjapur, who was allegedly assaulted by the chairperson’s wife, filed a police complaint on Thursday.“The complaint was registered in Varthur Police Station. It states that she had been assaulted by the chairman’s wife,” said Dr. M.B. Boralingaiah, DCP South East. He added that the principal had shown injuries on her hand.The principal, Dr. Azra Begum, had on Wednesday told The Hindu that she had been waylaid in the corridor and attacked by the chairman’s wife in front of students.Taking cognisance of The Hindu report, Block Education Officer (South 4) Ramesh had investigated the alleged incident and submitted a report to the Deputy Director of Public Instruction.“We have reported that the principal had a five-year contract but wanted to leave before completion to join some other school. Although her resignation was accepted, there was some sort of argument. However, we were not able to ascertain if she was physically attacked. Therefore, we have not mentioned this in the report,” he said, adding that internal scuffles in private schools were not, strictly speaking, liable to be monitored by his department. Dr. Begum could not be reached for further comments as she has barred all incoming calls. Parents and students, who had rallied around her on Wednesday, also could not be reached for their comments.
