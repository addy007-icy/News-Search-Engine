D.K. Srinivasan, an octogenarian, has been involved in social service for more than three decades. A successful businessman, he gave it up to start the Hindu Mission Hospital, Tambaram as its honorary founder secretary, which serves thousands of poor people from the cityâ€™s southern suburbs and even beyond. Mr. Srinivasan said it was a recognition for his work in the fields of medicine and education, which he attributed to teamwork. A desire to improve the quality of lives of less-fortunate in society motivated him to take a plunge into social work. He attributes his success to his wife Hema, their sons and daughters-in-law.- T.
