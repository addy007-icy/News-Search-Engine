While the Capital welcomed the New Year with the odd-even scheme to curb pollution, the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) used the 15-day period as a window of opportunity to “test drive” its zero pollution electric two-wheelers.According to the society, the result was encouraging. In fact, the experiment has been presented as a “successful project” to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.SMEV director Sohinder Gill said this is a “case study which has had a good trial run and could be looked at for implementation in the long run”.“During this period, 18,000 commuters used the service of free rides. As many as 100 electric bikes with riders were pressed into service to ferry people to their destination within 3 kms,” Mr. Gill added. At this point, the SMEV surveyed people, which showed the scheme had been accepted.The survey also pointed out how most commuters in the city were concerned about the increasing pollution and were interested in trying cleaner alternatives.“Around 4,000 people were interested in purchasing electric scooters provided we offered them longer life batteries and higher speed. Most of the respondents felt that electric two-wheelers are a solution towards curbing pollution, considering the fact that petrol two-wheelers are one of the major contributors to pollution,” the survey report noted.The city has approximately 65 lakh petrol two-wheelers. If even 10 per cent of them are replaced with electric bikes, carbon dioxide will come down by two lakh tonnes, said Mr. Gill.The group has now written to Mr. Kejriwal asking for his support. “We have asked the government to not allow two-wheelers in high polluting areas such as Daryaganj and install at least 1,000 charging pillars across Delhi.
