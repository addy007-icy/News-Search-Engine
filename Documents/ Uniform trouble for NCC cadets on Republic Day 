Many Republic Day programmes organised across the State this year will be conspicuous with the absence of National Cadet Corps (NCC) platoons as a good majority of the more than 78,000 NCC cadets in the State have not been provided with uniforms.Though uniform material has been procured for the State-level Republic Day programme, things are not clear for the district- and taluk-level functions. When taluk-level organisers of the R-Day programmes approached educational institutions for sending their cadets, the answer from many was in the negative and they attributed it to lack of uniforms.When asked about it, NCC Deputy Director General (Kerala and Lakshadweep) Brigadier Sanal Kumar said shortage of uniforms is not restricted to Kerala alone. Cadets in many other States encounter this problem. Uniforms are procured by the NCC Directorate at Delhi and allocated to the State directorates.He said that every year the NCC Central Directorate procures huge quantities of uniform material required for over 12 lakh cadets. “But the NCC is very particular about the quality of the material.” Two years ago the entire material supplied was rejected because it did not suit the quality standards set by the NCC Directorate.“When the consignment for such huge numbers of cadets was not accepted, it legitimately went into a backlog and the same has not yet resumed full Central provisioning. That has created the shortage of uniforms,” he said. When a shortage like this occurs it will take some time to resume normal supply, especially when the requirement is huge, he said. “But maximum efforts are being taken to manage with the limited supplies arriving,” he added.
