: For several years, those who missed out on the action on the various stages of the State School Arts Festival owing to various reasons had been depending on the short clippings on television to get a taste of the festival. But no more.That has changed in recent years with the webcasting of some of the major events on the official website of the festival —www.schoolkalolsavam.in.The IT@School project has been given the responsibility of running the website.Last year, the website got more than 16 lakh hits, according to IT@School executive director K.P. Noufal.This year, things are set to get bigger with live streaming from 14 different venues. The viewers can select the venue and event of their choice from the display panel.The video stream will be available in three different qualities, so that those connecting through slow Internet connections can also watch the events without any glitch.“The website has capacity to handle around 20 lakh visitors at a time. For the first time, we are also launching delayed telecast of the events near the green room. Usually, the participants do not get to watch their performance unless it’s recorded by their parents or friends. We will telecast the events with a delay of 10 minutes on screens set up near the green room, which will enable the participants to watch their performance immediately after the show,” said Mr.Noufal.
