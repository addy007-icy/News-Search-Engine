Opposing the Delhi government’s decision to scrap management quota in schools here, private schools have challenged the decision in the Delhi High Court.Terming the move as “absolutely illegal, arbitrary, whimsical and unconstitutional”, the schools argued that the government order is contrary to and violates various judgments of the Supreme Court and the High Court, and impacts the autonomy of private unaided schools to regulate their admissions.The writ petition, filed by the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools that comprises 400 schools, has requested the court to issue a writ, order or direction quashing the government’s order and asking the government to pass further orders granting relief to them.“In 1973, the Parliament enacted the Delhi School Education Act (DSE Act) and also framed the Delhi School Education Rules (DSE Rules) thereunder, thereby recognising and conferring maximum autonomy upon private unaided recognised schools functioning in Delhi, inter alia, to regulate their own admissions in a fair, objective and rational manner,” the Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools, argues seeking quashing of the order.The petition added that the order was an encroachment upon the autonomy of schools.“The impugned orders are also liable to be quashed in as much as they constitute illegal and arbitrary inroads and encroachment upon the maximum autonomy of private unaided schools who have put in their time, effort and resources to build institutions of high excellence,” the petition further said.It also added that neither the lease deeds executed by the land owning agency nor any law prohibits such quota. Filed by advocate Kamal Gupta, the petition highlights that even Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University guidelines permit a 15 per cent management quota in institutes of higher technical/professional education, where admissions are solely based on merit.The Delhi government recently asked all the schools to scrap management quota citing that it gives way to backdoor entry. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal referred to management quota as the “biggest scam in education”.
