“One thing I would like to see at this festival is a little less interference from the parents and the gurus. Just let the children express themselves freely.”- Smitha Raj,college student,Thiruvananthapuram“Most of the participants of the ongoing school arts festival have managed to uphold high standards in their performances. Sadly, there are not many viewers in most venues to appreciate their efforts. A greater public participation would have been encouraging for the budding talents.”- George Bastian, teacher, Government High School,West Kadungalloor, Aluva“Everyone keeps talking about how students take part in arts festivals for grace marks. It may be true for 60 per cent of the students, but the remaining are truly interested in taking the various art forms forward.”- Ramesh Kumar,Padakam artiste
