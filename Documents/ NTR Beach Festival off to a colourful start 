The otherwise sleepy Suryaraopeta beach on the city outskirts is bustling with activity following the commencement of three-day annual NTR Beach Festival on Friday.The two kilometre long sandy stretch has turned into a hub of entertainment overnight. Be it song and dance, shopping and a series of exhibitions, the beach is the only destination where there is something for everyone.The redesigned festival venue is attracting many, as an approach road was laid for the convenience of visiting public.There is no need of walking on the sand to visit the stalls and to the entertainment programmes as well.“I have been regular to this festival since its inception four years ago. There is a complete change in the arrangements this year, which are more people-friendly,” observes Ch. Surekha, a resident of Vidyuth Nagar, while busily capturing the flower arrangement on her smartphone.Photo exhibitionWhile the flower show, nurseries and aqua exhibition are the closed door ones, the other displays including the NTR Special Photo Exhibition are under open tents.Separate shopping areas have been allocated to the members of women self-help groups, weavers and tribals and each arena consists of 15 to 20 stalls displaying the products ranging from homemade pickles to Jandhani saris.“It is easy for both the shoppers and the stall owners, as every stall is prominently visible in this arrangement. Last time, our stall was located in a corner place and that was the reason why ours sales were not so significant,” recalls M. Parvathi, member of a SHG from Pithapuram, who is welcoming the visitors to taste the homemade pickles and sweets.Temple complexThe makeshift temple complex attracted major crowds and people made a beeline at the prasadam stall abutting the replica of Annavaram temple. ‘Kumbhakarna’ was the name of the food arena, where delicacies from the Rayalaseema region are the special attraction.The special photo exhibition of the doyen of Telugu tinsel world and former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao is another crowd puller, where hundreds of rare photographs and paintings of the late leader are on the display.Troupes of Gangireddulu, Haridasulu, Butta Bommalu and Pagativeshagallu and other folk artistes have given a traditional touch to the festival.Traffic restrictions“The police imposed restrictions on the vehicle movement, may be because of the Chief Minister’s visit on Friday.Many of friends are planning to come here Saturday and Sunday,” says Uday Krishna, a student of P.R. Government College, Kakinada.
