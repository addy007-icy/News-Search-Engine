Janata Dal (Secular) leader and MLA H.D. Revanna has alleged that there is rampant corruption in Hassan district administration.The officials had forgotten the welfare of farmers as they wee otherwise busy handling files related to realtors and helping sand and granite lobbies, he said at a press conference here on Monday.“It seems the office timing has changed in Hassan. No senior official can be seen in the office between 10.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. They all start working only after 5.30 p.m. and keep clearing the files till late in the night. I am told, Revenue Department officials are making large sums of money every month,” he said.Those involved in real estate business were being looked after very well in the present dispensation. Files related to land alienation and conversion were being cleared very quickly, he said.Further, the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj had not bothered to pay any attention to drinking water supply in rural areas. In many villages, borewells had gone dry.
