The meeting of the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation Council on Friday sprang up many surprises. It started with the new seating arrangements wherein the standing committee chairpersons and the Corporation Secretary have been provided seats on both sides of the Mayor on the podium. This has in turn changed the seating arrangements of the rest of the councillors, who have moved forward to be closer to the podium.The visit of a delegation from Karnataka and two Chinese travellers to watch the proceedings of the council was a bigger surprise.The Karnataka delegation of 31 members consisted of presidents, vice presidents and standing committee chairpersons from various local bodies who are touring the State to study various developmental activities such as solid waste management, road infrastructure, Public-Private Partnership models and waste water treatment. They already visited Sulthan Bathery and Kalpetta municipalities in Wayanad. Shaho Jin Chai and Ha Yun Ma from China are travellers in search of the historical links between Kozhikode and their country.They were accorded a warm welcome by the council.
