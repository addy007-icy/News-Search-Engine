Barely a week after a ruling JD(U) MLA was accused of misbehaving with a woman passenger on a train and another party MLA allegedly freed her gangster husband from police custody, son of an RJD MLA reportedly thrashed a government doctor at a hospital in Gaya district on Wednesday.According to the police, Dr. Satyendra Kumar Sinha lodged a complaint that he was beaten up by Ranjit Yadav and some others at the Primary Health Centre, Neemchak Bathani.Mr. Ranjit Yadav is the son of RJD MLA from Atri in Gaya district, Kunti Devi. His father Rajendra Yadav, a former MLA, is in jail in connection with a case of murder and kidnapping.“All of a sudden he [Ranjit Kumar] along with eight accomplices barged into the hospital and started hitting me with a wheelchair. It looked like he came with the intention of killing me,” Dr. Satyendra Kumar Sinha told The Hindu on the phone from Gaya, where he is undergoing treatment at a government hospital. “They first asked me to show them the attendance register of employees. When I refused to oblige them, they started beating me with whatever they could get hold of,” he said.
