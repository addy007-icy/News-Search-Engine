Crowds gathered in large numbers on the Maharaja’s College Grounds here on Saturday to witness the launch of the birth centenary of Dr. Shivarathri Rajendra Swami of Suttur Math by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They cheered for Mr. Modi all along. Even former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa enjoyed the crowds’ support as he too was applauded by them when his name was mentioned in the speeches. A section of the crowds interrupted Chief Minister Siddaramaiah during his speech. A large number of people, including some eminent personalities, had gathered in big numbers to listen to Mr. Modi. — Shankar Bennur
