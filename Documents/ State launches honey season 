In a bid to tap the State’s potential in making honey with medicinal values, the Kerala government on Friday launched a four-month long “honey season” through which cultivators and beekeepers will try to increase the production and sale of the product.Officials associated with the move say public sector honey procuring and processing agencies including the Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board, Kerala Horticulture Corporation, and the Forest Department will work for procuring honey from beekeepers and cultivators during the season.They procure raw honey at the rate of Rs.130 a kg and processed honey at a price of Rs.315 a kg.“Kerala, first in the production and the treasure of honey in the country, is all set for honey season beginning from January to April,” says M. Muhammed Haris, Financial Adviser, Kerala Khadi and Village Industries Board.Noting that Kerala honey has many peculiarities as its ingredients are collected from different type of flowers of various kinds of trees, he said the Kerala Forest Department sells forest honey at a price of Rs.385 a kg. “The bees collect honey from teak, rosewood, rubber, Arya vepu, cardamom, and vaka. But in Himalayan regions, bees procure honey from one type of tree, ie. Surya Kanthi. The medicinal value of Kerala honey is known to the country and abroad,” Mr. Haris claims. – PTI
