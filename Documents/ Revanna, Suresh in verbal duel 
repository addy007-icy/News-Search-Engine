Mr. Revanna, who is also an aspirant, strongly hit out at Mr. Suresh saying that the latter has no stake in the constituency as he resides at K.R. Puram in the city.Sources said Mr. Suresh asked Mr. Revanna not to seek the party’s ticket this time as he is keen to contest the elections. But Mr. Revanna rejected his plea and told him to have patience to grow in politics.Apparently, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge too was against fielding Mr. Suresh.The Independent MLC has been making every effort to grab Congress ticket in the constituency.Meanwhile, the Bengaluru city Congress office-bearers held a meeting at a private hotel and discussed about the selection of a candidate. A delegation, led by Congress veteran Rehman Khan, called on KPCC president and Home Minister G.

George, would recommend names, which in turn would be sent to the high command for final selection.
