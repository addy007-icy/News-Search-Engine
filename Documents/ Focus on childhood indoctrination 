Psychological impact of childhood indoctrination by parents and religious institutions has rarely been discussed in public because of the public disposition to be blind to anything that challenges the ways of traditions and religions practices. ‘Aamy – Oru Penkutty’ (Aamy – A Girl), a short film scripted and directed by Shammas Jamsheer, is an attempt to throw some light on the issue.The 30-minute film seeks to visually narrate through the story of eight-year old girl Aamy the damages done to children by parents by imposing their beliefs, rituals and practices on them. The girl being brought up in a family that strictly adheres to religious tradition is shown as struggling between restricting milieu imposed by faith and her innate sense of freedom.“We normally keep ourselves blind to the seriousness of childhood indoctrination because of reverence that religion and tradition enjoy in our society,” said Mr. Jamsheer, who hailis from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode.The film is an attempt to show how religious and traditional restrictions curtail children’s freedom and happiness. Aamy’s restrictive world stands in sharp contrast to the world of freedom she sees around her. A scene in the movie shows her as watching with a touch of melancholy a group of girls of her age going to dance class. She enjoys whatever freedom she has while going to a local grocery shop and seeing nature and people outside.Aamy is a victim of the denial of innate freedoms under the burden of given sacred laws, the film shows. Mr. Jamsheer said that the short film will be formally released next week.Chandana Shijesh plays the role of Aamy in the film. Cinematography is done by Naseer Vengara and Sathyadev. Cast also includes Aishwarya, Sneha Pradeep, Jeema Jayan, Bindu, Arathi Ajith, Sudhakaran Chooloor, Vasudev.
