The authorities of the Department of Archaeology of Museums have started removing the ‘gopurams’ that were raised on the sub-temples located on the premises of the historical Chaya Someshwara Swamy temple in Panagal on Satuday.The temple committee had started raising the gopurams of six sub-temples using bricks and cements in violation of the Andhra Pradesh Ancient and Historical Monuments Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1960. The Act prohibits construction of any additional structures using cement and bricks. But, the temple committee went ahead and raised these structures without obtaining any permissions from the Director of Archaeology of Museums.Noted writer from Nalgonda, Alikatte Shankar, took up the issue with Archaeology officials, who ordered the temple committee to stop the work with immediate effect. Following the directions of Director of Archaeology of Museums S.R. Vishalatchi, Assistant Director P. Nagaraju employed some workers and started removing these structures on Saturday. Mr. Nagaraju said that the entire work of removing the structures would be completed by Sunday. He said that they will allow no others to raise any kind of structures on the premises of any historical temple even in the future. “The restoration of any part of the temple will be taken by the Department of Archaeology and under the supervision of experts in the field,” he said.The temple, a ‘thrikutalayam’ constructed by the Kunduru Cholas in 11th and 12th century, is known for a mystifying shadow that falls on the ‘Sivalingam’.
