The YSR Congress Party took objection to the proposal of Andhra Pradesh Government to regularise assigned lands saying it would benefit the TDP leaders.Alleging that the assigned lands fell into the hands of the TDP leaders while dalits and other weaker sections were alienated from those lands, the YSR Congress spokesperson Vasireddy Padma said the government was planning to amend the act to allow the sale of assigned lands.She said that the TDP leaders would be the actual beneficiaries when the lands get sold. The fertile assigned lands in the capital region were in great demand and the TDP leaders have managed to take advantage. She said that nearly 1,800 acres of assigned land was estimated to have been transferred.She wanted the Government to refrain from going ahead with the proposal.
