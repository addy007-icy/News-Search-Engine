: Nagarro, an IT firm, in association with various companies launched a unique database on Tuesday to make travel easy and curb pollution in Gurgaon.The members include Nagarro, Snapdeal, Incedo, NTT Data, Fidelity, Authbridge, Fractal Analytics, Aricent, Genpact, Covergys, Teleperformance and Makemytrip. The firms together represent 100,000 employees/commuters. These companies see the value in moving beyond carpooling between individuals to possible bus pooling between clusters of companies, or at least providing data to private or public bus operators to optimise their routes. Another 25 firms have shown their willingness to be a part of this collaboration.“The idea is that by sharing information on our commuting needs (locations, shift timings), we can collaboratively create CNG bus routes that are not just viable but optimised – with minimum last-mile distance for our employees, fewer stops along the way, and possibly a greater frequency allowing some flexibility in travel timings. Third party providers like Shuttl.com or Ola or even public transport buses will also be able to use this data to improve their services for office-goers,” said Nagarro CEO Manas Fuloria.
