Irate farmers alleging that water was not reaching the tail end areas of the district staged a road roko seeking immediate water release to save the standing samba paddy crops on their fields.Farmers belonging to Thattankoil, Kottur, Kandamangalam, Chery, Marudur and Panaiyoor where samba paddy has been raised on hundred of acres said the water supply halted during the monsoon had not been restored to the tail end areas when the crops that were at the crucial stage of flowering when proper wetting was a must.That has led to the situation wherein the crops might wither for want of water if the authorities did not release water for a sustained and assured period in Koraiyaru and Mulliyaru to save the standing samba paddy crops.Farmers from those areas staged a road roko near the Thattankoil Public Works Department office blocking vehicular traffic on the Tiruthuraipoondi-Mannargudi highway for sometime. Upon information, PWD and Revenue officials rushed to the spot, pacified the agitated farmers, and assured them that adequate water would be released as per their demand shortly. Thereafter, the protesting farmers withdrew their agitation and dispersed.
