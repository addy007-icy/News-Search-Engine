With the State government making it mandatory for both the rider and pillion rider to wear helmet, the sale of helmets has witnessed a surge in Hassan. Many roadside shops selling helmets have come up here, even as hundreds of helmets are said to be getting sold each day. However, the Hassan police do not seem to be enforcing the new order to collect penalty from those not wearing helmets strictly.According to business circles, some people have got into selling helmets, keeping aside their main business, at least for the time being. Hundreds of helmets, priced between Rs. 400 and Rs. 700 each, are sold every day. “It is good time to earn some profit by selling helmets,” said a retailer. Fearing that the traffic police might start implementing the order strictly any time, people are briskly purchasing helmets. On Tuesday, a man was seen buying four helmets for his four-member family. “We have two two-wheelers and we need four helmets,” said Ramesh from Hemavati Nagar locality.Meanwhile, a majority of helmet buyers are women. Of course, many people have been cursing the government while buying helmets. “I don’t understand the logic behind making helmets compulsory for pillion riders. Many people, particularly women in villages, come to town for selling vegetables on motorcycles as pillion riders. They are not comfortable with helmets. Besides, they cannot afford to buy a helmet spending a few hundreds of rupees,” said Dayanand of Katihalli.According to sources in the Transport Department, more than 2.12 lakh two-wheelers were registered with the Hassan RTO and another 15,000 in Sakleshpur. Owners of all these two-wheelers would have to buy two helmets each.Hassan Superintendent of Police Raman Gupta said that the district police would soon enforce the new order and impose penalty for violation.
