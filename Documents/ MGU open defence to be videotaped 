Mahatma Gandhi University is mulling over a proposal to videotape the open defence sessions held before awarding doctoral degrees to its researchers.The move comes close on the heels of a discussion to step up quality of theses generated annually. The varsity also hopes that video recording of the open defence sessions would ensure transparency and bring in more accountability among researchers.Copies for candidates“We are planning to upload the video of the open defence sessions on the varsity website once the proposal is cleared. The candidates will also get the copies of the proceedings,” Registrar M.R. Unni told The Hindu on Thursday.The proposal came up for discussion, especially after experts pointed out that performance of the researchers in the open defence sessions were not taken in to account before awarding the doctoral degrees. They also recalled instances where researchers failed to answer even basic queries posed by experts attending the open defence. “That’s true. The quality levels have to go up in tune with the recommendations made by agencies like the UGC,” said Dr. Unni.The open defence sessions offer an invitation for experts from outside the varsity a chance to quiz on the research credentials of the candidate.The researchers in turn get a chance to defend their findings and its originality. The open defence tests the knowledge of the researcher and a poor performance does not deny awarding the doctoral degree to the candidate as per the rules.
