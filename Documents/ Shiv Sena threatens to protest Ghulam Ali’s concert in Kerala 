The ghazal concert of Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali in Kerala seems to have run into trouble with Shiv Sena on Monday demanding cancellation of the programme in the wake of Pathankot terror strike and warning of protest marches to the two venues in the state.The Sena’s state unit warned that its activists would stage a protest march to the venue of the concerts, scheduled to be held in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode districts on January 15 and 17 respectively.The 75-year old renowned singer, who is visiting Kerala on the invitation of a socio-cultural organisation ‘Swaralaya’, will also be accorded a public reception in association with the state government here on January 14.Announcing the decision to protest against Ali’s programme, Shiv Sena state executive member P. Aji said that it was a time of mourning in the nation and not for celebration in the wake of terror strike at Pathankote IAF base.“We are not against art, but against Pakistan,” he told reporters here.“What is the purpose of arranging a concert of a Pakistan singer, especially shortly after terror strike at Pathankot airbase where seven soldiers were killed?,” he asked.He also wanted Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to keep away from the public reception programme to Ali as a mark of respect to the soldiers killed in the terror attack.The Shiv Sena would observe January 15 and 17 as ‘protest day’ across the state by holding demonstrations at different places, the leader added.Last year, a scheduled programme of Ali was cancelled in Maharashtra following protest by the Shiv Sena.
