AIADMK members created ruckus in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, demanding action against former Union Minister P. Chidambaram’s son Karti over the Aircel-Maxis issue. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan allowed them to raise the matter later in the day.As soon as the House met, AIADMK MPs trooped the Well shouting slogans and demanded action from the Government.Amid the din, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said the Government had no problem in discussing the matter in any manner and also take necessary action.When Ms. Mahajan said she was ready to allow discussion on the issue after Question Hour, the AIADMK members returned to their seats.Few AIADMK members displayed copies of a newspaper which claimed that Karti Chidambaram has invested in real estate in various countries, as per investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax authorities during searches at his premises.Protesting against the Speaker’s decision to allow discussion on the matter, members of the Congress party rushed to the Well.The Congress members were heard shouting ‘we want privilege motion’. The Congress and other party members have given notices for privilege motion against HRD Minister Smriti Irani for allegedly misleading the House.In response, Ms. Mahajan said, “I want to make it clear that there is a procedure [related to privilege motion notice].”
