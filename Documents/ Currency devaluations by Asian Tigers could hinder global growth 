China’s decision to push the value of its currency lower has opened a new front of worry for global investors: a potential wave of currency devaluations among the so-called Asian tigers — South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.Such an outcome, a number of foreign exchange specialists say, would put a further damper on global growth expectations, which already are being revised downward as China’s once-booming economy retrenches.The dollar’s strong run recently — together with the plunge in the price of oil and other commodities — has damaged fragile emerging-market economies like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa; the dollar has risen 130 percent against the Brazilian real and the South African rand since mid-2011.The currencies of fast-growing Asian countries, including India, have largely been insulated, thanks to their better-performing economies and their ability to stockpile large foreign currency reserve positions.But having a strong currency at a time when manufacturing competitors like Japan and China have weaker currencies leads to a sharp fall in exports, which have been the economic lifeblood of these countries for decades.“These countries have some of the most overvalued exchange rates on the planet,” said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colorado, that advises large money management firms on global investment themes.When economies have high exchange rates, their exports tend to lose market share compared with countries with cheaper currencies. And when that happens, countries that depend on foreign trade will frequently take steps to push their currencies lower.Echoing these fears, the finance minister of Mexico, Luis Videgaray, warned that the Chinese currency actions could lead to a new round of competitive devaluations.The fear is that a currency war in Southeast Asia where the Asian financial crisis erupted in 1997 could result in lower growth and add to the already substantial concerns about the global economy this year and next.Earlier this week, the World Bank lowered its estimate for global growth to 2.9 per cent from 3.3 per cent, with expectations for just about all major economies being revised downward. Already, global money managers have begun to pull money out of some of these Asian markets.The Korean won and the Singapore dollar are down 5 per cent, while the Taiwan dollar has lost 7 per cent over the past six months.Even in India, perhaps the most popular emerging market among global investors, the currency has given ground, about 7 per cent, against the U.S. dollar.Underpinning the fears about a currency war have been the disappointing export figures from the region.For example, Korean exports fell 14 per cent in December compared with the same month in 2014. For the year, exports shrank 8 per cent, the worst result for the country since the global financial crisis in 2009.In Taiwan, government officials say they expect exports for last year to have fallen 10 percent; and in Singapore, the manufacturing sector at the heart of the country’s export-based model slumped 6 percent in the most recent quarter.These export figures are disturbing because they reflect that something deeper is ailing the global economy than simply a slowing China that is buying less oil from Nigeria, iron ore from Brazil or copper from Chile.Asian Tiger nationsStrong currencies in the Asian tiger countries have made their high-end electronic products like Samsung phones from South Korea and computer parts from Taiwan more expensive in Europe and the United States, their biggest markets.And with China, their main export competitor, expected to let the renminbi weaken further, these countries will face further pressure to let their currencies fall.The sudden export drop-off for manufacturing powerhouses like South Korea and Singapore troubles analysts who see it as a sign that the slowdown in the global economy is worse than people expect.“I expect these currencies to fall by another 20 or 30 per cent,” said Raoul Pal, an independent financial analyst and the founder of Real Vision TV, a media venture where sophisticated investors discuss their views on the market. “These export figures are a big deal — it’s a huge shrinkage in the dollar-based economy, as not enough people are buying goods.” — New York Times News Service
