The Delhi High Court on Wednesday adopted a surprisingly tough stance on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s odd-even rule while raising a question mark on the feasibility of continuing with the scheme beyond a week.The Division Bench of Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath had earlier described a bunch of public interest writ petitions challenging the scheme as premature, as the notification had not been issued then. On Wednesday, the court said the new rule was causing “great inconvenience” to the public.The court observed that the public transport infrastructure in the Capital was inadequate to deal with the extra rush of commuters and there were practical difficulties in the scheme’s implementation, such as lawyers being unable to travel with their files and books by public transport on the days when they could not bring out their cars.The court said the status report submitted by the Delhi government on the scheme’s implementation was vague and sought information about the pollution caused by taxis running on diesel and CNG which have been kept out of the purview of the odd-even rule.The Bench observed that the data on pollution levels in different parts of the city during the first six days of the scheme’s implementation should be sufficient for the government to decide the future course of action.
