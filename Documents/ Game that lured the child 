Kuldeep would have gotten away with the crime if it had not been for some persistent policemen, an alert passenger and a bit of luck.Having searched dozens of vehicles passing through a point in Aligarh, a police team and the kidnapped boy’s uncle Vishnunath Bansal finally entered a bus where in signals from Kuldeep’s mobile phone were very strong.But not equipped with Kuldeep’s photograph, no one was able to identify him. “Having searched once, we were getting off the bus, but some policemen insisted that the boy was most likely inside that vehicle. So we decided to search once again,” Vishnunanth told The Hindu.Almost immediately, Vishnunath felt a slight nudge from one of the passengers. “The passenger signalled to me that there was someone covered inside a blanket in one of the seats. I removed the blanket to see my nephew Naitik inside,” he said.When the blanket was removed, Naitik was found playing a ‘snake game’ on Kuldeep’s mobile phone. “Kuldeep knew that Naitik loved playing this game, so he lured him with that. All through the journey, the boy was kept silent because of the game,” said an investigator.Naitik, meanwhile, said he was unaware about where he was being taken. “He said that my father was calling me, so I went with him. He allowed me to play the mobile game, so I travelled with him,” said the boy, adding he was fed two packets of chips and a bottle of water on the way.
