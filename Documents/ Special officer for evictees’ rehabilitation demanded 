Home to several high profile development projects involving human displacement, the appeal for a dedicated officer for the rehabilitation of evictees is gathering momentum by the day in the district.The coordination committee for the people displaced by development projects is set to hit the protest path terming the absence of a rehabilitation officer equivalent to the special officer for land acquisition a travesty of justice.It demands the appointment of a special officer of the rank of deputy collector for the rehabilitation of evictees.“There is a deputy collector for practically every purpose from elections, land reforms and land acquisition to disaster management.But the rehabilitation of people evicted for development projects is entrusted with the very same machinery and officers who evicted them, which involves an inherent conflict,” said Francis Kalathungal, general convener of the committee.The absence of such a full-time officer has been cited as one of the major impediments to the proper rehabilitation of evictees.Meanwhile, the committee launched a renewed bout of protest demanding the implementation of the Moolamppilly rehabilitation package for people evicted for the Vallarpadam International Container Transshipment Terminal.EventOn Saturday it organised an event inaugurated by Bishop Sebastian Edayanthrath to mark the fifth anniversary of a promise given by Oommen Chandy, when he was still the opposition leader, to implement the rehabilitation package on a priority basis if the United Democratic Front was voted into power.It was held as a reminder for the chief minister and the government led by him.Eighth anniversary of the forceful eviction at Moolamppilly and the notification of the original rehabilitation package fall are due on February and March followed by the fifth anniversary of the announcement of the revised the rehabilitation package by the UDF in June.Another bout“Saturday’s event will mark the launch of another bout of struggle aimed at mobilising support invoking the collective conscience of the society,” Mr. Kalathungal said.The committee said that so far just 38 out of the 316 affected families could shift to the rehabilitation plots while the rest continue to languish in shacks and rented accommodations.22 livesThe hardships of leading the life of an evictee have so far claimed 22 lives not to mention the discord in many families, the committee said.Implementation of Moolamppilly package demandedOnly 38 out of 316 affected families have shifted to plots
