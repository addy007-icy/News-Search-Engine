Security was stepped up along the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border in The Nilgiris from around 1 a.m. on Tuesday, following a suspected Maoist attack on the house of a bank manager at Sulthan Patheri in Wayanad district in Kerala at 12.30 a.m. It is learnt that two men riding a two-wheeler were involved in the attack.A car of the bank manager was set ablaze by some miscreants.With the place of attack being only about 15 km from the State’s border from Devala Sub Division in The Nilgiris, security was stepped up at seven check-posts in Devala and Gudalur sub divisions that are close to the district.Three quick response teams were deployed near three check-posts in Devala sub division with five armed personnel in each team. “These teams were provided with a vehicle so that they could rush to a place upon receiving information on attacks or infiltration attempts,” Superintendent of Police (SP) of the district, Murali Rambha, told The Hindu .Security was also strengthened at police stations close to the State border with double police sentry at each station round the clock.Following a series of periodic attacks by Maoists in Kerala last year high compound walls were built around the police stations close to the border in The Nilgiris to secure them from possible attacks – like the attacks that took place at Palakkad, Wayanad, Silent Valley and in Malappuram districts.
