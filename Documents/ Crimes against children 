Crimes and assault on children have not been given the necessary importance (“ >Supreme Court to hear plea to award castration to those who rape children,” Jan.11). In the absence of stringent laws, the culprits have an easy escape route, while the victim is left with scars that haunt for a lifetime. Hence, the Supreme Court needs to be complimented for its candid observation on child rape. Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code needs to be amended suitably to ensure that culprits do not escape the clutches of law. The Centre should have acted on this long back and it is sad to note that the apex court has to intervene in setting things in order.Balasubramaniam Pavani,Secunderabad, Telangana
