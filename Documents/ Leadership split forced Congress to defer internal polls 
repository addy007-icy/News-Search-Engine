The Congress missed its deadline for conducting internal elections four months ago because of a split between the leadership over whether to stick to the old election model or implement the new one strongly backed by party vice president Rahul Gandhi.Confirming the delay, the Congress treasurer Motilal Vora told The Hindu that the party has sought a year long extension from the Election Commission of India.“We are in the process of finalising our membership drive across the country so we need some time,” said Mr. Vora, adding that the Commission has granted them the desired extension.But what led to the hold-up is the conflict between the new and the old ideas triggered by Mr. Gandhi’s initiatives to democratise the party on the pattern of its youth wing.A senior party leader told The Hindu that Mr. Gandhi was keen on introducing a model that demanded Rs.100 as a membership fee, abandoning the traditional requirement for each member to bring in 20 more “primary members” so as to gain the “active” status.From an economical standpoint, the leader said, the model could have brought in “decent” money but at the same time it could have led them to compromise on experience and seniority.After a year-long bickering, Mr. Gandhi finally gave up on his demand.“We are sticking to the old process,” the party leader said.
