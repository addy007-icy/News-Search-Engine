Subhash Chandra, Additional Chief Secretary to RDPR Department, expressed his anguish over the abysmal performance of the Mysuru Zilla Panchayat in implementing schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. He cautioned the officials concerned, including senior officials in-charge of implementing the scheme, that disciplinary action would be initiated against them, if they failed to implement the scheme sincerely.Mr. Chandra, who held a meeting with district-level officials here on Monday, expressed surprise as to why the officials concerned were reluctant to implement the scheme in the district, while it was being successfully implemented elsewhere. He asked P.A. Gopal, the ZP Chief Executive Officer, to instruct the officials to implement the scheme effectively in the coming days.“No wonder the district is lagging behind in the list of high performing districts under the MNREGA scheme,” he said, adding that Mysuru ranked 21 in the list of performers.
