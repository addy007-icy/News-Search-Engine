Ahead of the Deodhar Trophy final between India-A and India-B at the Green Park here on Friday, it is pertinent to analyse how the players, who aspire to make it to the Indian team, have fared in the tournament so far.Delhi opener Unmukt Chand and Karnataka all-rounder Stuart Binny are two such players who showed the willingness to work hard and make an impact.India-B captain Unmukt, who has led India to an under-19 World Cup triumph, has matured with time to do well this season.The selectors’ decision to give him the chance to captain India-A and India-B on different occasions also speaks of the 22-year-old’s potential.His half-centuries (77 not out and 63) in India-B’s wins over India-A and Gujarat not only showcased his attractive strokeplay but also reflected his ability to play responsibly according to the situation.Binny came into the tournament well prepared under the supervision of his father, former Test cricketer Roger.He picked up two wickets against India-A and shone with his allround performance (41 and two wickets) against Gujarat.Gujarat wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel scored a brilliant 119 to show he had a lot of cricket left in him.Young Chirag Gandhi also won a lot of admiration for his fighting 100 against India-B even though he could not ensure a win for Gujarat.Rayudu’s caseIndia-A captain Ambati Rayudu struck two half-centuries (58 and 75) to stake his claim for returning to the National team.Kedar Jadhav impressed with his entertaining 91 not out while helping India-A beat Gujarat.India-A off-spinner Perveez Rasool displayed his allround skills by scoring a useful 66 and claiming four wickets.Leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who is working on his batting and overall fitness, exhibited his variations to snare six batsmen.India-B medium pacer Dhawal Kulkarni bowled with a lot of discipline. He was highly economical besides being effective enough to grab four wickets.Nathu Singh, who bowled a fiery spell to take three India-A wickets, found that he needed to be more consistent.Leg-spinner Karn Sharma, who bagged two wickets and played a cameo 22-ball 24, may also provide an option.The final will be another occasion for the players to prove their mettle.
