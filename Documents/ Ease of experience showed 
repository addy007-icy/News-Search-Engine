The performance of Srekala Bharath, starting with an anjali in Valaji, was a theme-based margam, focussing on lord Muruga. The highlight of the introductory number ‘Shadakshara Kauthuvam’ in Shanmukhapriya, composed by Madurai R. Muralidharan, was a fast-paced nritta piece danced with competence.The Khamas swarajathi of Kadigai Namashivaya Pulavar ‘Ma mohalahiri meerude’, was the centrepiece of the show. The sancharis depicting the joys of birds and animals being together and the nayika tortured by Manmatha’s arrows, unable to bear the pangs of separation, made for some moments of sensitive abhinaya.But in certain other places, such as the one where she offers gifts to cajole her sakhi to go fetch her lord, the gesture of removing her jhumkas and bangles were not quite appealing. The jathi sequences could have been handled in a softer manner, both in the utterance of the syllables and its rendering through footwork. However, some jathikorvais stood out for their vibrancy, blended with graceful stances. Bringing in the folk flavour were the conversations between Avvaiyar and Muruga, depicted through a ragamalika composition. The sudden introduction of jathis and swaras was a little out of place though. Also Srekala could have lent an emotional depth to Avvaiyar’s portrayal, than a mere physical representation of an old woman.A Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar tillana in Paras, performed with dynamism and precision of footwork, was the finale.The vocal support provided by Kishore Kumar was adequate but he should infuse soft melodic variations to make his singing more appealing. Padma Aghavan (cymbals), Dhananjayan (mridangam) and Kannan (violin) provided commendable support.
