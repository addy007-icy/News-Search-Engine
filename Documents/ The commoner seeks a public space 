A meeting of public-spirited individuals here on Sunday to discuss the possibilities of a public space for the common man in the city has seen unstinted support from various quarters. A committee was set up to take the idea forward. The meeting, attended by people from different walks of life, ranging from bureaucrats and academicians to social workers, was the result of a notice that appeared in sections of the media and social networking sites.Many, while supporting the concept, pointed out that similar common public spaces that existed in the city were facing difficulties in different forms, including harassment from official systems, police and even moral policing.The suggestions that came up centred around a space, where people could sit together, discuss, read or listen to songs, have refreshments â€“ all in a space free of political, gender, caste and religious discrimination. Some suggested that the space should also have special provisions for senior citizens as well.The meeting wound up with a 17-member committee being constituted temporarily to scout for and suggest suitable locations for the space
