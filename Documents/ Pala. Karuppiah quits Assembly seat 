A day after he was expelled from the AIADMK, MLA Pala. Karuppiah claimed he had tendered his resignation from the Assembly.Addressing reporters here on Thursday, Mr. Karuppiah also urged Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to implement prohibition in the State. “The government’s term is coming to an end. At least now ‘ Amma’ should announce prohibition. A State cannot depend on funds from the sale of liquor. If Rs. 30,000 crore is the amount gained from the sale, imagine how many people could be drunkards,” he said. It would be dangerous for the State to have such a large consumption of alcohol, he opined.On his being removed from the party, he said the AIADMK supremo’s style of functioning and his own differed. “I have been in the party for 10 years and it was ‘Amma’ who made me an MLA. She told me that she would make me an MLA six months before the elections and that was despite opposition,” he recalled.On Ms. Jayalalithaa, he said she was a decisive leader. “She is very sharp. She controls lakhs of party cadres very well. A mere glance is enough to tell them she is unhappy,” he said. On his resignation from the post, Mr. Karuppiah said it was not fair that he continued to hold the post after being expelled from the party that made him MLA. “I apologise to the people of my constituency for being unable to function properly,” he added. Asked if he knew why he was expelled, he speculated that an interview he had given a Tamil magazine could be the reason. “I am quite outspoken and have been pointing out various issues, which was not liked,” he said.
