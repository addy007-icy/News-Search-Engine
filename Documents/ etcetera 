Balancing actModel-turned-actor Arjun’s debut film was director Laxman’s debut film, Masala Padam, where he played a critic who aspires to become a film director. “I was in final year of Engineering when Masala Padam happened, and it took me another year to complete my studies. But, it was well worth the delay. After the film’s release, I took another pot shot at the world of fashion and won the Model Hunt 2015. The experience I gained from Masala Padam is tremendous, and I have been offered three films,” says Arjun.And he has just signed up for a lead role for Thaami directed by Praveen Kumar, produced by Lava Kusha Cinemas.Scary night outDirector Manisharma has no qualms about his film Bayam Oru Payanam being yet another film in the horror genre. “This film can be on par with The Exorcist, The Omen, Evil Dead or The Conjuring,” says Manisharma. The hero of his film is Bharath, a doctor by profession, who had played the cop role in Unnaipol Oruvan. “He makes his debut as a hero in Bayam Oru Payanam, and plays a photographer who goes on a late-night assignment to a lonely locality. Faced with unexpected problems and resistances, he decides to return home, in the middle of the night. On the way, he encounters numerous scary incidences, and a normal two-hour journey extends to a spine-chilling three days. Whether he returns safe or not forms the rest of the story. Vishakha Singh will play the role of a ghost. Meenakshi Dixit plays the second female lead,” says Manisharma.
