Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities have set themselves a stiff target of getting the project ‘systems readiness’ from Miyapur to Mettuguda this year covering significant sections of the two major lines of Miyapur to L.B. Nagar (Corridor One) and Nagole to Shilparamam-Raidurg (Corridor Three).Senior metro rail officials have already affirmed that all out efforts are being made to start commercial operations in at least two sections of Mettuguda-Nagole (8 km) on Corridor Three and Miyapur to S.R. Nagar (12 km) on Corridor One within the next few months.If the first stage is complete in all aspects, trial runs have commenced in the second construction stage and overhead stations are fast nearing completion. Besides, the two major depots spread across nearly 100 acres each – Uppal and Miyapur, have been completed.L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Managing Director and Chief Executive V.B. Gadgil said the major challenge for his engineers would be to complete the remaining seven rail over bridges in all aspects including the vital one to cross over the Secunderabad railway station, which will also provide access between overhead metro stations and the busy rail station down below through skywalks.The viaduct had already been built over Bharatnagar and the remaining are at Chilkalguda, Alugaddabhavi, Lakidikapul, Malakpet, Begumpet, Oliphenta and Bhoiguda. Thus far, 50 (three cars) trains have received and the remaining two trains are to be received by the month-end.All trains are in various stages of testing in depots. “We require a total of 576 trains, but we now have sufficient rolling stock to take the service to more areas. We have managed to do 63 per cent of the project in two-and-half years ever since July 2012, the appointed date,” averred Hyderabad Metro Rail Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy.
