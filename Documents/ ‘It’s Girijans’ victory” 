Cancellation of permission for laterite mining in the un-surveyed land of 35.84 hectares adjacent to Asanagiri under Sarugudu panchayat of Nathavaram mandal was the victory of Girijans, CPI (M) said on Wednesday.Partyâ€™s district committee secretary K. Lokanadham said that the party fought along with the Girijans against Singam Bhavani securing the lease in 2009 with the help of fake documents and demanded that the government take action against her for mining some thousands of tons of laterite with this lease and destroying the forest area and damaging the life of Girijans and wild life.He also demanded that the government provide drinking water, roads, medical care, power and other amenities and implement the Forest Rights Act, 2005, to the Girijans living in the 16 villages on the hill for the last many years instead of continuing with gap area status to the forest area to facilitate the mining mafia to plunder the mineral wealth.
