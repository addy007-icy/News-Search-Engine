While most of the evidence against the six arrested in the State are in the form of their digital footprints discussing Islamic State (IS) with other suspects, the more clinching proof of conspiracy against them is said to be their alleged meeting in Tumakuru.The alleged meeting, said to have taken place in the garb of a trek three months ago, was attended by Muddabir Mushtaq Sheikh from Mumbai, the alleged kingpin of the group busted now, sources said. The meeting was also allegedly attended by Mohammed Nafeez Khan from Hyderabad, from whom explosives have been seized. “The meeting in Tumakuru provides strong evidence of a conspiracy,” a senior official said.While NIA sleuths had planned to take some of the suspects to a forest area in Tumakuru, where the alleged meeting was held, the course of action changed midway. Sources said NIA sleuths were expected to visit the spot in due course.
