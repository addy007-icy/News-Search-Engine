Operate additional bus servicePrivate buses plying between Thanjavur New Bus Stand and Tiruchi do not stop at SASTRA University during morning hours. Students or their parents going to the university depend on TNSTC buses resulting in overcrowding and causing inconvenience.The Transport Department should operate additional buses on this route.G. Sathyanarayanan Iyer,Thanjavur.Ensure smoothflow of trafficA college, school, museum, darbar hall, Saraswati Mahal Library, fire service and police station are situated in Thanjavur palace complex apart from passage to Sarafoji vegetable market at East Main Street. This street is quite busy due to a large number of vegetable vendors, public, tourists and students from dawn to dusk.To ensure safety, speed breaker on either side of the road to the entrance of the palace complex should be set up.It will ensure smooth flow of traffic and avoid accidents.N.
