A massive capacity expansion of distilleries is happening in Telangana in tune with the growing demand for Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).With the existing 18 distilleries not able to meet the growing demand, the Prohibition and Excise Department gave permission for two new distilleries, one each in Medak and Mahabubnagar and allowed three other existing IMFL manufacturers to expand their capacities.“The department has geared up with a slew of measures, sanction of new distilleries, expansion of capacities and even sanctioned additional production capacity to the distilleries for the year 2015-16. Some of the distilleries are already in place,” said Excise Commissioner R.V. Chandravadan.While the production capacity of 18 distilleries is 2,019 lakh proof litres (LPLs), 814 LPLs capacity is under utilised for various reasons. Thanks to expansion drive, 1,200 LPLs capacity will be in place soon while permission was given to produce 112 LPLs to existing units which exhausted their sanctioned quota for this excise year.While excise department remained one of the top revenue grosser even in united Andhra Pradesh, post bifurcation, Telangana had been witnessing major spurt in the demand for IMFL. Thanks to the cosmopolitan nature of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, upwardly mobile population and presence of major MNCs in the IT and other sectors, the State has registered over 30 per cent growth in the last two months, necessitating the capacity expansion of distilleries.The IMFL market in Telangana garnered attention as the demand went up from 16 lakh cases a month to 22 lakh cases a month in October and November resulting in inquiries from players outside the State - mostly from Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.Government’s pro-industrial policy, ease of doing business has also become a facilitating factor, department sources said.What also added to the demand for IMFL has been the government’s drive against the illicitly distilled (ID) liquor (gudamba), a menace that not only posed a health hazard to the consumers but claimed lives at regular intervals. With clamp down on ID liquor, there has been a massive shift to IMFL. Telangana government had initially thought of introducing cheap liquor to dissuade people from consuming gudumba as part of its excise policy but dropped the proposal as it did not go down well with the public. However, with the demand for the IMFL going up, it became imperative to expand the distillery capacity lest it would give an opportunity to the unscrupulous elements to brew illicit liquor.Post bifurcation, Telangana realised the need to set up spirit distilleries as most of them are in Andhra Pradesh. One spirit distillery was already set up in Khammam.Post-bifurcation, the State has realised the need to set up spirit distilleries as most of them are in AP
