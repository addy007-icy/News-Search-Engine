The TRS will contest all 150 divisions in the polls to GHMC with the goal to win 100 divisions though the party has a post-poll understanding with the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM)This was emphasised by TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at a meeting of the party MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other senior leaders here.Sources said Mr. Rao admitted to an understanding between TRS and MIM, yet the former will go it alone in the elections as surveys showed that the party was likely to win 80 to 85 seats.Briefing reporters later, Commercial Taxes Minister T. Srinivas Yadav said the TRS will explore the support of MIM in the election of the Mayor after the polls.Mr. Rao was stated to have asked the party cadre to gear up for an intensive campaign in all divisions from January 6 as the polls were likely on January 23 or 24. He ruled out conceding requests in the selection of candidates since it would be solely on the basis of surveys.Sources also said Mr. Rao asked all the MPs, MLAs, MLCs and Ministers to monitor works on water grid, Mission Kakatiya and irrigation projects on a daily basis because they stood a chance of re-election if the programmes succeeded in their respective areas. They should not focus on appointment of officials or routine programmes like school buildings, roads and bridges. He recalled how the Congress lost public support because of poor governance. The same should not be repeated.Mr. Yadav quoted Mr. Rao as asking the party leaders to take the successes of the TRS government to the public in an effective manner. As the surveys showed that the TRS will win 80 to 85 divisions, it should not be difficult to reach the magic figure of 100.Mr. Rao stressed on division-wise committees to steer the campaign. The public should be informed that development will be faster if the State and municipal corporation were ruled by a single party.
