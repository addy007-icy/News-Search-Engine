The YSR Congress has demanded that the State government clarify its stand on the special category status to Andhra Pradesh as it was the only way to ensure accelerated development of the State. Unless the State pronounces its stand on the crucial issue, events like Partnership Summit would be construed as nothing short of self promotion and publicity boost.The Union Ministers had clarified that special package and special category status were not in the offing for the State where development indicators were weak in spite of tall claims by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, YSRC leader Botcha Satyanarayana said.Claiming that the effort to attract investments and entrepreneurs was a positive step, he, however, said these could be feasible only when the State was granted special category status.The TDP being a coalition partner at the Centre should put in all out efforts to secure the coveted status.Referring to the Partnership Summit which saw the State signing 361 MoUs with different companies envisaging an estimated Rs. 5 lakh crore investment, he said the investments and figures mentioned in the MoUs were hyperbolic.This was evident from the fact that the partnership summits conducted during the previous tenure of TDP failed to bring any major industry to the State.
