After working for an NGO for six years, Sanjay Biradar quit his job of a marketing executive when his request for a pay hike was rejected. While searching for a job, in 2005 he decided to start his own handicraft unit by utilising his past experience of working for the NGO.“There was a time when I was looking job for myself. Today I have given employment to around 200 women. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction of giving livelihood to others,” he said. This 45-year-old entrepreneur runs a handicraft unit called ‘Hands’, where he prepares jute-cotton based products.Mr. Biradar, who now manufactures over 20 designs of around 50 handicraft products, says that most of his products are exported to the U.S. and European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Spain and Italy.“In the beginning, I was selling my products to local shops and a Delhi-based agent exported them to the U.S. and Europe on a commission basis. In 2011, I got my own export licence from the Export Promotion Council of Handicrafts coming under Union Ministry of Textile. Since then, I am exporting materials directly to these countries,” Mr. Biradar said.He said that his women employees earn around Rs. 6,000 a month which is an additional income for them.He said that he also has sells this products through boutiques in Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi. With the annual turnover reaching Rs. 35 lakh, he said that he is willing to offer free guidance to unemployed youth who wish to start their own such unit.“Instead of hunting for jobs, one could start such unit where he/she can provide employment to other also,” Mr. Biradar said.For any guidance or more details on setting up of handicraft unit, Mr. Biradar could be contacted on 9886735877.
