Most of the classes were not held in the Government Arts Colleges in Tiruvannamalai and Cheyyar on Wednesday as college teachers went on a mass leave to participate in a road roko to press their ten-point demand.Responding to the call from Joint Action Committee (JAC) of College Teachers, college teachers applied for leave en masse and a section of them attempted to stage a road roko.G. Elango, zonal president of Tamil Nadu College Teachers Association, a constituent of JAC, told The Hindu that they insisted on rolling back the new pension scheme. “Grade pay has not been given to teachers appointed after 2006 and we want the government to give it soon. Posts of Vice Chancellors are vacant in 5 universities in the state and we want them to be filled soon,” Prof. Elango said.“Classes were not held in all the five arts colleges in Vellore region including those in Tiruvannamalai, Cheyyar, Gudiyatham and Wallajah apart from Vellore Muthurangam Arts College,” he added.
