In a first, carbonated fruit juices of grape, apple, and pomegranate have been developed by the CFTRI. Union Minister Harsh Vardhan launched the juices standardised by the institute with each one of them containing 20 per cent fruit extracts.This new process can possibly help the country towards ‘Yellow Revolution’ since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked multinationals to mix their carbonated drinks with fruit juices to help farmers.India processed only 2.2 per cent of its total fruit production, which is far less compared to the U.S. (65 per cent), Philippines (78 per cent) and China (23 per cent).Almost 35 per cent of fruits and vegetables are wasted because of lack of processing and storage capabilities, according to the institute.The research outcome on carbonated drinks at CFTRI gains significance as the consumer market for soft drinks is growing at 30 per cent annually with a whopping Rs. 25,000 crore.
