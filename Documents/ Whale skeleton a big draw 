At least 5,000 visitors thronged the make-shift enclosure here where the 30-feet skeleton of a sperm whale is on display.Most schoolchildren in and around Nagayalanka village have already visited the place to document facts and the life cycle of the mammal. Wildlife lovers and people from different walks of life from across the State are seen spending their time at the enclosure which was arranged by some local youths.Aqua farmer T. Raghu Sekhar first displayed the skeleton for public after the wildlife authorities had completed the preliminary study on its procurement on January 23. Given the necessary conservatory measures it attracts in accordance with the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, local youths are guarding the skeleton as directed by the wildlife authorities.Officials will soon shift it for display at the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in East Godavari. “On hearing about the skeleton, visitors are thronging here. We allow visitors round the clock,” Mr. Sekhar said. The skeleton being preserved on the banks of Krishna will be kept for display until the wildlife authorities shift it to the sanctuary.
