We must stop living in a dream world and be prepared for reality. Pakistan knows that it can only fight a proxy war with India and we need to be prepared for that (Editorial, Jan.7). Despite multi-layered security at our borders, it has been shown that terror elements are able to slip across the border, something which raises questions about the way in which our borders are being guarded. Rather than divide the job between the paramilitary forces and the Indian Army, there should be a move to have only one line of command in the border States. The same principle should apply to the police. Talks with Pakistan can never succeed as non-state players manage the country’s affairs.D.S. Thukral,AmbalaIt is terrible that despite several alerts and warnings about a possible terror attack, the authorities chose to remain passive. When the system is incapable of safeguarding vital installations such as an air force base or even a nuclear plant, how can we be reasssured that we are safe? Every attack only exposes the level of complacency and casual attitude towards security.N. Sadhasiva Reddy,BengaluruIt is a matter of shame that there was gross mismanagement and inefficiency in countering the terrorists (“Deploying NSG instead of Army was a mistake: experts”, Jan.6). With no clear chain of command and control, the operation lost its prime element. What is striking about Pathankot is that there was a well-trained infantry and armoured teams but they were kept waiting. The military needs to understand the importance of “functional foremanship”.Vishwesh Hande,Mumbai
