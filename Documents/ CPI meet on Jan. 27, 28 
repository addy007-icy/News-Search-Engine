The CPI State executive and secretariat will discuss the issue of assigned lands at a meeting to be held on January 27 and 28 respectively, according to CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna.Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the CPI leader said that the party would also discuss the State governmentâ€™s proposal to increase the lease period to 99 years from the existing 33 years. It was an attempt to hand over lands to corporate and private people. The government paved the way for sale of assigned lands with its decision to register the transactions. The decision was defeating the objective of providing livelihood through land to the poor, he said.
