Hyderabad MP and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Asaduddin Owaisi, who was trolled by “supporters of ISIS” on Wednesday, said on Thursday that the online responses have not got him worried.The MP also said he fears no security breach. “I have faced more threats than several people here. I get threats almost every day. As long as God allows me to live, I will. There is not question of upping security,” Mr. Owaisi said. Mr. Owaisi’s twitter account was trolled by some holding handles that have content in support of ISIS. According to the barrister, he will continue to be critical of ISIS as he does not believe them to be related to Islam or its ideals and virtues. “If those people hiding out like rats threaten to take over my country I will respond and resist. ISIS has already killed 1.5 lakh Muslims. They have killed women and children. I have always condemned them and will continue to do so,” he said. He, however, condemned the US policies which allowed ISIS to grow as a terror outfit. “The US policies which lead to the invasion of Iraq led to the growth of ISIS and that should be condemned,” he said.He also pointed out that Islamic scholars across the world had issued fatwas against ISIS. Talking to The Hindu , Mr. Owaisi said, he has not asked for special security. “When he started trolling by calling me un-Islamic, I responded and called him a “Takfiri” or a Muslim who calls another Muslim a non-Muslim. There is nothing more to it and I will continue to the critical of ISIS,” he explained.
