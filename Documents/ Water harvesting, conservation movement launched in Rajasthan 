Mukhya Mantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan (MJSA), described as the country's largest campaign of its kind towards water harvesting and conservation in rural areas, was launched by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje on Wednesday.The campaign, inaugurated by Ms. Raje at Jhalwar, and at other places across the State by the Ministers, aims at benefitting 21,000 villages by 2020, with 3,000 villages benefitting this year and 6,000 villages per year for the next three years.The programme focuses towards participation from the village locals, NGOs, non-resident villagers, religious communities, and corporate houses through their CSR initiatives in cash, kind and labour for water harvesting in Rajasthan's rural areas.“With a budget of Rs.3,600 crore for the first phase of the campaign, ending on June 30, 2016, a shortfall of Rs. 1,200 crore has been estimated. This is sought to be met by crowd sourcing resources through the participation of both citizens and organizations of all hues,” State government's statement to the media mentioned.Ms Raje, said that on the first day of the campaign over Rs.7 crore had been collected from Jhalawar towards water conservation and harvesting. “We have collected over Rs 7.1 crore here today from local citizens, social groups and business leaders. The entire police force of the State has pledged to donate one day salary, totalling Rs. 8 crore, to the MJSA. Then through the combined efforts and resources of the government and the people, we are determined to make a success of this State-wide drive,” she said.Speaking to the media, recently, Ms Raje had said that Rajasthan was facing grave shortage of drinking water and water for irrigation, which, she said, had made the campaign for water harvesting and conservation imperative.Ms. Raje has also announced of donating her six-month salary to the campaign, with the Rajasthan Cabinet Ministers announcing a commitment to donate three month’s salary, members of legislative assembly would be donating a month’s salary and bureaucrats a day’s salary for the campaign.
