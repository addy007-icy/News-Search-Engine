Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Coimbatore on February 2 to inaugurate the Employees State Insurance Corporation Medical College and also address a public meeting.According to S.R. Seghar, state media in-charge, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the medical college around 3 p.m. and thereafter address the meeting at the grounds near the CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex around 6 p.m.In all likelihood, the Prime Minister’s public meeting will kick start the BJP’s election campaign in western districts, where it thinks it has a good presence. The party leaders are working hard to mobilise as many public workers as possible from The Nilgiris to Salem districts. “Our target is to make one lakh persons attend the rally,” Mr. Seghar said.Even as the party is mobilising workers, it is also talking to its alliance partners so that they can share stage with Mr. Modi.BJP sources say the Prime Minister’s presence will boost the confidence of workers and leaders alike ahead of the Assembly elections.The party is focussing on those Assembly segments where it performed well in the 2014 Parliamentary election.
