‘While walking through the soil,’ a series of paintings by freelance artist Subin Abraham, displayed at Kerala Lalithakala Akademi art gallery at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan, has vivid images of rural landscape.Mr. Abraham, a resident of the city and a former teacher with a private school here, has filled many a canvas with myriad shades of nature, which are vibrantly and realistically portrayed in watercolour. “The pictures which form part of the exhibits are images captured during my journey through the States of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh during the past four years. The pictures are a recreation of the images captured during these travels,” he said.The frames, which are heavily tinged with shades of green, show farmers tilling the field, with their children around, farmers walking past heaps of haystacks on dry paddy fields and people fishing in ponds. “My pictures communicate with the audience. If you closely notice, most of who work on the fields are women. It’s something which startled me while travelling through the Northern parts of the country,” he said.In connection with the exhibition, he has released a book titled Present Day Kerala- Culture and Art , which deals with the socio-cultural changes happening in the State. There are 30 pictures on display. The paintings are priced between Rs.10,000 and Rs.30,000. The exhibition is on till January 31.
