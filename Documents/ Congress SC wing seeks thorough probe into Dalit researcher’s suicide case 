Activists of the Scheduled Castes (SC) wing of the Congress staged a protest here on Tuesday demanding a thorough probe into the alleged suicide of Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula of the University of Hyderabad (UoH).Addressing the protest meet, S. Thangaraj, functionary of the SC wing of the Shivamogga District Congress Committee, said that the incidents of atrocity on Dalit students and research scholars had increased in the institutions of higher learning in recent times. It was unfortunate that in the name of disciplinary action, Mr. Vemula and four other students, who were members of the Ambedkar Students’ Association (ASA), were suspended by the Hyderabad University authorities. They were also barred from entering the hostels, administration building and other common places. Mr. Vemula, who was hurt by the discriminatory treatment meted out to him, had taken the extreme step, he said.The protesters blamed Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment Bandaru Dattatreya, who is said to have written to the Ministry of Human Resource Development that the ASA was an anti-national organisation, for the suicide. The police had booked cases against Mr. Dattatreya, charging him with abetting to suicide and violating the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The protesters said that to ensure a fair probe into the incident, Mr. Dattatreya should be dropped from the Ministry, immediately.The protesters urged the government to initiate measures to avoid recurrence of such incidents in the future. The Congress activists submitted a memorandum to President of India through the Deputy Commissioner’s office. Functionaries of the Congress Harsha Bhovi, Vanesh Naik, K. Eshwar, Megharaj, R. Naveen, Tavarya Naik and Dhananjay took part in the protest.
