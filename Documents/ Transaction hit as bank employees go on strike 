All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) members here on Friday went on an one-day strike here, protest against the ‘unfair policies’ adopted by the State Bank of India (SBI) with respect to its five associate banks.The employees of various banks staged a dharna in front of the SBI branch near NTR Circle here. “The agitation was organised protesting the unfair labour practices of the SBI management which is trying to force the new service conditions on its associate banks,” said Nagesh Kumar, Vijayawada Bank Employees’ Coordination Committee secretary.The union is against the imposition of SBI’s service conditions and Career Progression Scheme on the associate banks. “We oppose the decision to increase the working hours from present six and half hours by an hour. The SBI has also plans to do away with the part time sweepers posts and outsource the service. The SBI is going against the agreement, which it had entered into with the employees association,” he said.The employees also demanded delinking the associate banks from the SBI. The SBI has five associates- State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Hyderabad and State Bank of Patiala. The AIBEA had earlier planned a similar strike on December 1 and 2 last year. However, the strike was deferred after a conciliation meeting was held on November 23, wherein the SBI management had agreed to defer the implementation of the Career Progression Scheme and hold bilateral discussions with the employee unions, the protesters said.
