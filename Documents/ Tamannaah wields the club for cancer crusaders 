The greens at the Hyderabad Golf Club in the vicinity of the historic Golconda Fort came alive when film star Tamannaah Bhatia wielded the ‘club’ briefly to formally launch the Cancer Crusaders Invitation Cup golf championship on Sunday morning.It was all grace and poise from the tinsel celebrity especially for those young children afflicted by the cancer and being taken care by the Cure Foundation of Apollo Hospitals. The select gathering was clearly floored by Tamannaah who made it a point immediately on arrival to interact with a child in the comforts of her mother and then exchanged bouquets with another cancer-struck child before formally launching the event.“I am glad that Dr. Vijay Anand Reddy had thought of me for this event. I assure you all that I will be always a phone call away to be associated with this sort of gestures,” she said amidst applause. “We all have a social responsibility to care for those battling against adversity despite being so young,” Tamannaah remarked.Dr. Vijay Anand mentioned that the Foundation had so far treated about 1,000 cancer patients free of cost as part of the corporate social responsibility.“The fourth edition of this Cup to be played on February 6 and 7 is essentially a fund-raiser with a donor entry costing about Rs.3,000. It is more about being part of a social cause and feel proud of contributing to providing a fresh lease of life to these patients,” Dr. Vijay Anand said.“The event will also feature a Celebrity Golf Play-off on February 7 under lights and celebrities from different walks of life will try their hand in golf as part of their efforts to help our cause,” he added.
