In many aspects, the students of government institutions are not on par with their counterparts studying in private schools.However, the students of government high school at Sapthagiri Colony in Karimnagar have shown that they are second to none in any aspect.Here, the students are administrators and involved in academic and other activities of the school for effective functioning and also help the students develop leadership qualities.The students work on par with their teachers on all aspects for the benefit of student community.The school took up the novel concept of involving the students in all issues pertaining to the school for better functioning and yield good results with increase in attendance and also academic performance. The authorities have constituted various committees headed by headmaster as chairperson and another senior faculty member as coordinators.They constituted committees on education, sports and discipline, food and health, environment, culture and technical.For each committee, a student was appointed as minister and another as his deputy and also a secretary for monitor the particular committee. Besides, each committee would also have 10 members of students studying from class VI and X, and also three teachers as advisors of the committee.For instance, the education committee would oversee the performance of teachers albeit completion of syllabus and conduct of various tests, etc. in each section.They would ensure that all the students were given notes accordingly and prepare for the examinations.The food and health committee would ensure that all the students eat mid-day meals and no one is allowed to go home for lunch. They would ensure that the students wash their hands and plates with soaps and collect the food in a queue and no wastage of food. Likewise, each committee has its respective duties for effective functioning.Claiming that the formation of various committees with students had ensured less absenteeism and the students were focusing on academics with more interest, headmistress G. Pramoda said that “involvement of students to do something in school is naturally helping them learn as doing is such a nature where learning naturally happens”.She also said that the students were learning the leadership qualities from their schooldays onwards.The students, Divya, Huda Samreen, Raju and Mounika, who are involved in the committees as ministers, said their involvement in school development was really helping them learn through participative approach with an ease.
