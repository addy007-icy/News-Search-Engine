The Chinna Kishan tank in Belur village, which remained dry for the past five years due to recurring drought, filled up on Sunday, thanks to the release of water from the Kariakovil dam in Pappanayakkanpatti and Aanaimaduvu dam in Puzhuthikuttai village recently.A large number of farmers visited the brimming tank on Sunday.Following the widespread rainfall experienced by the district in the months of November and December, the Kariakovil dam and the Aanaimaduvu dam filled up. The PWD authorities released water into River Vasishtanadhi from both the dams for farm activities in about 8,600 acres on January 8.The Kurichi tank, Belur Chinna Kishan tank and Kottavadi Periya Kishan tank received copious inflow for the past ten days, thanks to heavy flow of water in River Vasishtanadhi.The Belur CHinna Kishan tank filled up on Sunday, bringing much joy to the local people.The farmers are also happy that the copious inflow into the tanks and also the continuous flow of water in River Vasishtanadhi has recharged the ground water level to a big extent and also increased the water storage in the open and borewells.This will ease the drinking water problem in these villages to a big extent during summer, they said.
