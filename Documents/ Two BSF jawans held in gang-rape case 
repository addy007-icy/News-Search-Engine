Five days after a minor girl alleged that she was gang-raped in a train compartment by jawans, two Border Security Force (BSF) personnel were arrested from Guwahati in connection with the case. They were produced before a district court in Howrah which remanded them in 14 days’ judicial custody.Last Sunday, a minor girl who boarded a Punjab-bound train had mistakenly got into a compartment that was reserved for Army personnel. After the Jharkhand Police rescued her from Madhupur , they arrested an Army jawan and handed him over to the Bengal GRP.“During questioning, the girl told us that there were two more jawans in the compartment and so to trace them we showed her the video footage of the compartment from where she identified the two other jawans,” a senior official of the GRP told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.“The CISF at the Airport was given photographs of the two and after our team reached there, they were arrested and brought back to Howrah,” said the GRP official.
