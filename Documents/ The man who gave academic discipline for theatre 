In the 1960s when Malayalam theatre was heavily under the influence of literature, G. Sankara Pillai brought in academic discipline and a system which laid the foundation for modern Malayalam theatre.“His efforts rendered the stage and theatre actors a dignity that was lacking until,” said actor-activist Sajitha Madathil on the 25th death anniversary of the doyen of Malayalam drama.Addressing an informal gathering of disciples, associates and followers of Pillai at an event organised at Nanappa Art Gallery on Friday, Sajitha said Pillai’s plays were noted for their amazing craft. In plays like Etho Chirakadiyochakal (a solo performance structured around the mythical character of Kunthi) and Bharatha Vakyam, he created ‘normal’ female characters behaving like real women, she said.Sajitha said her criticism of Sankara Pillai for expunging the history of women from theatre in his ‘Malayala Nataka Sahitya Charithram’ (The History of Malayalam Drama Literature) stemmed from her worldview as an activist. “When I raised this point sometime ago, maybe in a way that was a little immature, it did not go down well with his disciples. My own ‘Malayala Nataka Sthree Charithram’ [The History of Malayalam Women’s Theatre] was in response to his book. It would not have happened without his work and in hindsight, I feel he did not focus on the question of women in theatre as he was rightfully preoccupied with granting Malayalam theatre a whole new identity,” she said.Earlier, Jayasoorya, theatre personality who was part of the first batch of students at School of Drama under Pillai, recalled his experiences of learning acting. “His words and deeds gave primacy to the actor on stage. He used to tell us that basic discipline and commitment to theatre shaped an actor and his kalari system of teaching created a ‘system’ for Malayalam theatre,” he said.While he had been often referred to as a playwright of the symbolist school thanks to pervasive images in his plays, it would be unfair to limit him to a custom.Artist T. Kaladharan recalled his association with the towering personality and how he helped the former Kalapaeetom organise sessions with visiting luminaries from outside Kerala.
