A.Anbalagan, MLA on Monday asked the people of Puducherry to bring AIADMK’s rule in the Union Territory.Addressing the 99th birth anniversary celebration of AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran, Mr. Anbalagan accused the AINRC government of failing to keep its promises.No initiative taken for jobs“The present government has not taken any initiative to create new job opportunities or upgrade the infrastructure of Puducherry.Many industries have closed down, the development of this union territory has relegated due to the government’s failure and the government has not ameliorated the lives of the farmers,” he said in a press statement issued on Monday.Schemes only to woo voters'He alleged that the Puducherry government was distributing freebies and announcing welfare programmes to woo voters for the upcoming elections. “In the four and half years of their rule, the government has not done anything. Even the measures announced have not reached the places represented by the opposition parties,” he said.“The paper mill in the Embalam constituency was closed down and more than 900 lost their jobs. There is corruption even when this land was sold. CBI has filed case against a bureaucrat. But, why have they left the politician involved go scot-free?” he questioned.
