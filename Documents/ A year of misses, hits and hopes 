There were several misses for Malayalam cinema in 2015, but there were some big hits as well. Films like Ennu Ninte Moideen , Premam , Oru Vadakkan Selfie and Amar Akbar Anthony did great business at the box office, exceeding the expectations.Because of the large number of theatres available for a film’s release and the premium rates for tickets in multiplexes and many other cinemas in big cities, the films featuring major stars often manage to make good money within a few days of the opening.Films like Mohanlal-starrer Loham and Dulqar-Salman starrer Charlie are examples of that.“That was something you could not have imagined in Kerala till the advent of multiplexes; because of them we could also hike the prices,” says Jose Joseph, managing partner, Apsara Theatre, Kozhikode. “And if a film catches the imagination of the audience, like Premam and Ennu Ninte Moideen did, the producer hits the jackpot.”A film like Pathemari may not have set the box office on fire like those two blockbusters did, but it earned its producers good profit. The film’s success also revives, after a long time, hopes of meaningful cinema in the mainstream.Salim Ahamed’s honest film on the travails of one of Kerala’s earliest fortune-seekers in the Gulf countries, had no ingredient meant for box office success, but it managed to move the audience. The film also saw Mammootty giving a brilliant performance – his best in years.The fact that the art-house cinemas, such as CR No. 89 and Oral Pokkam , got cinemas for their release – and some of them managed to attract fairly decent number of viewers, too – also offer hope for Malayalam cinema. As do some young directors, like R.S. Vimal, who made Ennu Ninte Moideen .
