Discharge of sewage and dumping of waste in a pond, near the famous Sri Santhana Srinivasa Perumal temple on Vellalar Street in Mogappair, by a few residents have been a cause for concern.During the weekends and the annual festival, a large number of devotes come from various parts of the city and from neighbouring districts. The pond remains an eyesore and a breeding ground for mosquitoes.“The stench from the pond is unbearable as it envelops the entire temple due to its proximity to the shrine,” said S. Prasad, a devotee from Choolaimedu.Residents allege that some families living around the pond discharge sewage into the waterbody. They also dump garbage in the pond.“Such waterbodies within city limits may not provide water fit for drinking, but they surely help in recharging the groundwater table in a neighbourhood,” said R. Varalakshmi, a resident of Mogappair, adding that the pond must be revived. Residents want the pond to be de-silted and a compound wall with walker’s path built around it, to protect it from misuse. Residents have complained many a time to the civic officials of Zone – 7 (Ambattur). However, Corporation officials have not taken any steps to protect the waterbody, say residents.“We will prepare a plan to renovate the pond soon. Action will be taken against those responsible for letting in of sewage and dumping garbage in the pond,” said a Corporation official.
