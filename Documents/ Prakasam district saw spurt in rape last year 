Even as the Prakasam district has introduced the e-initiative to help out women seeking the police help, crime against women continued to remain high last year.The number of such crimes went up to 916 during 2015 from the 906 in the previous year, says SP Ch.Srikanth, exhorting women to feel free to lodge complaints against eve-teasers online.Instant Complaint Logging Internet Kiosk (I-Click) introduced last year had helped 79 women to approach the police without visiting police stations and get quick relief, Command Control Centre in-charge officer V.Suryanarayana said.In all, 845 persons have lodged complaints remotely so far. “'We give a top priority to attending to complaints lodged online from the ATM-like kiosks and want more number of people to use the facility,” the SP said, adding that plans were afoot to open a new I-Click kiosk in Markapur for the benefit of people in western Prakasam. The victims of eve-teasing and other crimes against women could also visit the Facebook page of the AP Police- Prakasam and get help.As many as 419 complaints by women during 2015 were related to cruelty and harassment in their in-laws’ houses by their husbands and in-laws, he explained, adding that such crimes went up by 4.4 per cent over the previous year. Counselling by women police had helped dispose off 245 cases through compromise, explained Women Police Station DSP B. Lakshminarayana. A major cause of estrangement between couples was addition to liquor among men (100 cases) followed by extra-marital affairs (49 cases) and demand for dowry (36), he added.The next major head of crime related to outraging the modesty of women, which showed a marginal decline of 4.62 per cent to 268 incidents in the district. But the number of rape cases went up to 63 from 50 during the year, the SP said and attributed it to clubbing of cases relating to illegal intimacy by men with a false promise to marry their victims. Dowry death cases went up by 100 per cent to 8, while murder of women declined by 18 per cent to 18 cases during the year.Sexual harassment of girls went up to 33 as against 29 in the previous year, resulting in invoking of the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the SP said, adding 63 women were abducted last year as against 50 during the previous year.Sexual harassment cases go up; SP urges women to make use of I-Click to file complaints
