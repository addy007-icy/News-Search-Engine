It’s over 45 years and still slum dwellers living in Valmiki Nagar of Majgaon under Ward No.2 of the Belagavi City Corporation are yet to get basic amenities .Locality residents marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office to air their woes here on Wednesday.Led by district president of the Slum Janandolana-Karnataka Shankar R. Dodmani, they said that almost all the residents of the slum belonged to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and earned their livelihood through daily wages.They said that they had been residing for over 45 years and the government was generous enough to provide ration cards and Electoral Photo Identification Card (EPIC). That apart, a tanker was arranged to supply drinking water once a day.However, the authorities had recently stopped operating the tanker, forcing the residents to fetch from sources away from their locality. Also, there was no electricity in the locality and the senior citizens and young ones face difficulties. The slum dwellers said they were not demanding comforts or luxury but only water to drink and electricity connection: “We request you to restore tanker service to supply drinking water and direct the Hubballi Electricity Supply Company to provide minimum illumination in our locality,” they said.
