The Poonamallee High Road-Stanley Viaduct junction near Chennai Central railway station is one of the busiest traffic junctions in the city.However, the construction of an underground Metro Rail here has resulted in the reduction of road width, and thereby creating a chaotic situation. Despite the presence of a large number of traffic police personnel, motorists violate traffic rules, pedestrians cross at undesignated points and autorickshaw drivers park their vehicles on pavements.Pedestrians complain that motorists do not bother to stop at the signal, raising the risk of accidents.R.S. Murugan, a resident of Ambattur, said the presence of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras, until a few years ago, had helped prevent traffic violations by motorists, but the cameras were missing at present, he said.A senior official of the City traffic police said the CCTV cameras were removed from traffic junctions where Metro work was going on to protect them.Once the work got completed, the CCTV cameras would be re-installed, he added.
