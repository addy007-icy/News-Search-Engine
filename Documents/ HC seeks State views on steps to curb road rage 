The amicus curiae had said that the committee should meet once in a month and review the running time target of one kilometre in three minutes set for private buses and revise the same, taking into consideration the traffic, road conditions and ongoing metro rail works.He suggested that committee should also fix an appropriate maximum speed limit for KSRTC and private buses in the city and ensure that the maximum speed limit was strictly adhered to by all the buses.The committee should also ensure that the bus crew and owners were fined separately for violation of the speed limit. The licence of the driver and the conductor and the vehicle permits should be suspended for a particular period if the speed limit was exceeded for a second time. For further violation, the licence or permit should be cancelled and the crew shall be debarred from being employed in any other bus.
