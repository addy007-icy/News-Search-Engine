In yet another warning to private schools charging extra fee, the Delhi government has asked over 400 private schools to refund the extra amount within 15 days.Last year, the Directorate of Education (DoE) had directed 472 schools to refund the amount within 15 days.However, only 43 schools have complied with the order so far.A committee headed by Justice Anil Dev Singh had identified 472 schools that were overcharging parents on the pretext of implementing recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, but were not doing the same.“As per the reports received, merely 43 schools out of 472 schools identified to refund excess fees in Justice Anil Dev Singh Committee’s eight interim reports have complied with the order. The defaulter unaided recognised schools are directed to comply with the directive and submit a status report within 15 days,” a DoE communication issued on Monday said.According to the directive, schools that have charged excess fee to implement the 6{+t}{+h}Pay Commission, but have not implemented the same, are supposed to make the payments to its staff as per the commission’s recommendations.“If after implementing the 6{+t}{+h}CPC in the school, there still remains excess money charged from the parents, it shall be refunded to the concerned person,” the circular said.
