While the National Investigation Agency (NIA) claims the detentions and arrests made on Friday were over the suspects’ alleged links to Islamic State (IS), families of two of the suspects claimed they were framed because they were acquainted with Maulana Anzarshah Qasmi, a cleric from Bengaluru arrested for his alleged links to Al-Qaeda in Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) in the first week of January.Mohammed Afzal’s wife Bushra Tabassum said here on Friday that her husband attended visited Qasmi’s lectures and bayans at Banashankari mosque. “He was also listening to his bayans frequently. Not that he was close to him. But he knew Qasmi. It seems he has been framed for this,” she said.The family members of Syed Mujahid Hussain, detained from Tumakuru, also claimed that he had contacts with Qasmi and had been listening to his lectures and bayans.While Qasmi was linked to the AQIS, the now-detained and arrested are said to have been linked to the IS. The two terror organisations are at loggerheads.
