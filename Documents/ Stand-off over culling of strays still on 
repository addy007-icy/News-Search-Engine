: The standoff between the Maradu Municipality and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) over the culling of stray dogs has worsened.A day after the Maradu police registered a case against the municipal chairperson and the municipal secretary and two dog catchers, a council meeting of the local body decided to `keep all options open’ to curb the menace. “A meeting will soon be convened with the SPCA on the issue for framing a practical solution to the issue. If they fail to come up with a concrete plan, we will go on our own’’, Ajitha Nandakumar, municipal chairperson said.Besides, the council decided to make licences mandatory for all pet dogs in its jurisdiction.The chairperson also expressed her willingness to face all consequences for this decision as “it is the elected representatives and not the SPCA members, who are answerable to the 45,000 people residing here.She attributed a sharp rise in “the number of stray dogs in the area to the practice of people abandoning their aged dogs in isolated properties on both sides of the National Highway passing through the municipality.The SPCA while expressing its willingness for talks warned of legal action if the municipality violated the norms of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act .“We will be filing a contempt of court petition against the municipality for the stray dog culling. Further, a petition will be given to the State Drug Controller as to how the dog catchers procured the lethal drug `SUCOL’ for killing 90 dogs’’, TK Sajeev, Secretary of SPCA Ernakulam said.He further accused the local body of ignoring a circular issued by the Local Self-governance Department last month to form monitoring committees on a war footing to contain the menace.“The municipality is misleading the people after their sterilisation programme for dogs, initiated in the last term, came a cropper due to lack of planning’’, he added.The issue kicked up a row after a group of councillors from Maradu municipality led by chairperson staged a sit-in at the Maradu police station for the release of two dog catchers hired by the civic body.The council has decided to make licences mandatory for all pet dogs in its jurisdiction.
