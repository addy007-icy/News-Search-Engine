It has no basis. We have distributed hybrid varieties as per order issued by our department as farmers in the State have been using only hybrid varieties,” said L. Sitherasenan, director, Horticulture and Plantation Crops.The department has selected short duration and nutritious vegetable crops including bhendi, bush type lab, radish, palak, coriander, arakeerai and thandukeerai for “Do it yourself” scheme aimed at promoting vegetable cultivation in urban areas.Seeds of bhendi, bush type lab, ‘arakeerai’ and ‘thandukeerai’ were procured from Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) while coriander, palak and radish seeds were sourced from private sector. ‘Arakeerai’ can be harvested in 30 days, ‘thandukeerai’ in 40 days, radish in 45 days, palak in 35 days and coriander in 30 days.“They are less prone to pests and diseases.
