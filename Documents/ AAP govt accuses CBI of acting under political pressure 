The Aam Aadmi Party government on Friday accused the Central Bureau of Investigation of acting under political pressure in carrying out a raid at the office of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar recently. The seizure of documents in the raid smacked of “vindictiveness and arbitrariness”, it said.In its reply to the CBI's petition in the Delhi High Court seeking stay and quashing of the trial court's January 20 direction to return the seized documents, the Delhi government alleged that the raid at the Delhi Secretariat was carried out on December 15, 2015, in an “unprecedented haste”, while throwing to the winds all procedural safeguards.The AAP government sought dismissal of CBI's petition with heavy cost, saying it was “frivolous, baseless, vexatious and meritless”.The Delhi government's affidavit was filed in the court of Justice P.S. Teji, who had on Thursday sought its early response to the CBI's petition, while observing that he did not wish to keep the plea pending for several days.The affidavit, filed through the Delhi government's standing counsel Rahul Mehra and Richa Kapoor, said there was no need to raid the senior bureaucrat's office and indiscriminately seize the documents unrelated to the case. It said that the CBI's petition was an “abuse of [the] process of law, not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed at the threshold.”In his January 20 order, the CBI Special Judge had rapped the premier investigating agency for flouting its own manual by seizing documents without showing how they were related to the alleged graft case.The CBI has contended in its petition that the Special Judge had failed to appreciate that the Delhi government had already obtained attested photocopies of the documents seized, rendering the order for returning the documents “wholly misconceived”.However, the AAP government said the probe agency had sought to jeopardise the functioning of the democratically elected government by arbitrarily targeting to raid Mr. Kumar's office. It had “miserably failed” to explain the relevance of the seized documents which were unrelated to investigation, it said.The affidavit also defended the trial court's order, saying it was passed on sound reasoning and was totally correct on law and facts, requiring no interference.The High Court had on Thursday refrained from passing an interim order to stay the direction.Govt said the raid at the Secretariat was done in ‘unprecedented haste’
