The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has decided to crack the whip on schools that did not celebrate Republic Day on Tuesday.The decision was taken when the Block Education Office, North Range-4, received an oral complaint against a private school in Yelahanka for not observing Republic Day and declaring the day a holiday.Schools have to compulsorily observe days of national importance, said an official. “The school claims that they celebrated (Republic Day), so we have sought a report along with photographs,” he said, adding that the department would initiate action if the school doesn’t come through with it.
