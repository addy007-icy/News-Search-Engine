This is a different project altogether, and it will feature Shruti as Kamal’s daughter,” a source close to Haasan told.The film will be directed by veteran Malayalam filmmaker T.K. Rajeev Kumar.“Since Kamal was already in talks with Rajeev for Amma Nanna Aata, he brought him on board to direct this film, which will feature his script. Kamal has been working on this script for a long time. Haasan is in talks with maestro Ilaiyaraaja to compose the music for the film.
