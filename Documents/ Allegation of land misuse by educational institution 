Ramesh alleged on Saturday.He claimed to have filed multiple complaints with the Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru (Urban) district, the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force. He said the land is in Mathikere, which comes under BBMP’s Rajarajeshwarinagar zone.In 1980, Chikkamaranahalli, Dyavasandra and Mathikere, which were under Bangalore North taluk, were taken over by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA). “In 1991, 76 acres were transferred by the State government over to an educational institution on the condition that the land be utilised for building educational institutions and housing the poor and employees of industries situated nearby,” he claimed and added that this was supposed to have been fulfilled within three years’ time, failing which the land could be taken back by the BDA.However, nearly 75 per cent of the land is being utilised for commercial purposes, he alleged. A private layout had been formed on 14.2 acres where luxury apartments have come up without the requisite sanctions, he alleged.Deputy Commissioner, Bengaluru (Urban) district, V. Shankar confirmed that he had received the complaint, which would be investigated.
