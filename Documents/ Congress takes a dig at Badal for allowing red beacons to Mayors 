The Congress on Sunday took a dig at thePunjab government’s decision to allow city mayors use red beacon on their vehicles, saying municipal corporations would benefit more if instead funds were ensured to them for development.“More than the red beacons atop their vehicles the mayors need money for their municipal corporations and councils so that they can carry out some development work, which has remained standstill for last nine years,” State Congress chief Amarinder Singh said in a statement here.The PPCC chief also regretted that the “helpless” mayors too seemed to be happy over the “lollypop” offered to them by Mr. Badal.Acceding to the request of the mayors, the Chief Minister had on Saturday allowed mayors to use red beacon atop their official vehicles and asked the Principal Secretary, Transport, to issue necessary instructions immediately in this regard.Capt. Singh said the cities in the State were “crying for development” while municipal corporations and councils were “starving” for funds.Except for the token announcement that Principal Secretary, Finance, has been asked to transfer Rs. 422 crores to the local bodies “at the earliest” the State government seems to have neither any “intent” nor any money to offer to the local bodies for the development of the urban areas, the former chief minister alleged.The Congress leader also charged Mr. Badal, who is into his tenth year of chief ministership now, with surviving on “tokenism and false assurances” without any intention to fulfil the commitments and announcements he makes.“And at the fag-end of his tenure he tries to appease the mayors by allowing them red beacon atop their vehicles, which most of them were already using anyway,” he said. - PTI
