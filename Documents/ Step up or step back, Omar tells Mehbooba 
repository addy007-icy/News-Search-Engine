Former CM and National Conference working president Omar Abdullah on Tuesday asked Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti to “either rise to the occasion or step back” after the imposition of Governor’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir.“If you are unable or unwilling to assume the responsibilities that are being placed on your shoulders, then you must do your duty to the people, recommend to the Governor to dissolve the Assembly, and let the people make a fresh decision in an election,” Mr. Abdullah said in an open letter that appeared on the television channel NDTV. Expressing apprehensions over the delay in government formation, he said: “The people of the State cannot be expected to wait for you to make up your mind. Taking over now is not a sign of being power-hungry; but not taking over is certainly an abuse of the trust the people placed in you and your party.”‘Abuse of people’s trust’He called the delay the “biggest disservice to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.”The State has been under Governor’s rule since January 9, after Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed died on January 7.
