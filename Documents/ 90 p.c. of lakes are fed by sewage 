The encroachments listed out in the status report by the Joint Legislature Committee could just be the tip of the iceberg.While the committee believes 89.25 per cent of lakes in and around Bengaluru have seen some sort of encroachment, a recent study by a team from Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) shows that 98 per cent of lakes have lost land.The team, led by T.V. Ramachandra of the Energy and Wetlands Research Group of the IISc., studied 105 lakes in the city and found that 90 per cent see sewage flowing into them. Of these, 25 were covered by water hyacinth — an indicator of the sewage flow — through out the year.The water quality of the lakes was so bad that just 2 per cent of the lakes come under the Central Pollution Control Board standards for drinking water, while a staggering 80 per cent resemble wastewater fit only for industrial use. Similarly, just one in five lakes can support a thriving fish population.The study believes that sewage continued to flow unabated and often untreated into lakes owing to the low functioning of the BWSSB’s sewage treatment plants. Out of a designed capacity of 721 MLD, less than half — barely 302 MLD of sewage — was undergoing treatment before being released into the city’s storm-water drains, rivers and lakes.Consequently, the worst affected series of lakes are those in Koramangala–Challaghatta valley, resulting in the severe pollution seen in the lakes such as Bellandur and Varthur.105 lakes studies in and around Bengaluru25 lakes have little or no water98 per cent of lakes have seen encroachment90 per cent are fed by sewageLow pollution: 24 lakes, includes Ulsoor, Agara, Hebbal, Rachenahalli, Hesaraghatta, Yelahanka, and Doraikere lakesModerately polluted: 22 lakes, includes Hemmigepura, Madiwala, Lalbagh, Sankey, Dasarahalli, Kaikondrahalli, and Jakkur lakesHighly polluted: 34 lakes, includes Begur, Doddanekundi, K.R. Puram, Allalasandra, Varthur, Bellandur, and Arekere lakesCelebrating the city’s lakesEven as the torrid details of Bengaluru’s lakes continued to do the rounds in public debate, at least two lakes saw residents come out in celebration of the few remaining thriving waterbodies amid the concrete jungle of the city.The first kere habba (lake festival) was conducted on the banks of the sprawling 43-acre Kaikondrahalli lake on Saturday. Workshops, bird walks, competitions and games for children, music, film screening, yoga and even interactions with native cow breeders marked the festival, which not only hoped to raise awareness of the importance of lakes but also to raise funds for the upkeep of the waterbody.Meanwhile, at Sankey Tank, hundreds of students and artists came together to sketch their hopes and disappointments of the city’s waterbodies. Ripples, organised by Art Matters, hoped to create awareness on endangered lakes of the city by encouraging students to paint the various issues that have choked the lakes.
