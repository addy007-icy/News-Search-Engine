Decisions of the district administrations in coastal Karnataka to permit sand extraction from rivers in the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) in the guise of removing silt from riverbeds appears to have opened a Pandoraâ€™s box as the riverbeds in these districts are being drained of whatever sand available.In Dakshina Kannada district, over 8 lakh tonnes of sand have been excavated from April last till date, a majority of which has been transported to Bengaluru region and some to neighbouring Kerala.On the other hand, sand extraction continues to threaten fragile areas such as the Uliya Kudru in the Netravathi [Kudru is a river island] and other Kudrus along many other rivers in the coastal districts. Despite a specific ban on sand extraction near Uliya Kudru by the Mangaluru Tahsildar, sand extraction is continuing unabated, alleged B.K. Imtiyaz, district vice-president of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI).He said that the Tahsildar passed the orders on December 10 last following a series of protests by residents of Uliya and the subsequent visit of Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim.Meanwhile, sand-laden trucks and tippers move on the interior roads ostensibly to avoid being caught at the border check-posts.The Thokkottu-Konaje-Mudipu road, which once witnessed movement of vehicles of educational institutions, is now swarmed with sand-laden trucks.Local residents claimed that the vehicles use interior roads to reach Kerala via Mudipu-Uppala Road avoiding border check-posts on National Highway 66.Periodic warningsPeriodic warnings and orders issued by the district administrations appear to have no impact on illegal sand extraction and transportation.Recently, Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner A.B. Ibrahim issued a magisterial order, reiterating the standing provisions that sand extraction upto 500 m on either side of any bridge was prohibited. Still, such activities continue in both Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts.Again on Wednesday last, Mr. Ibrahim, chairing a task force committee meeting on sand extraction, issued directions to the officials concerned to take stringent action against illegal extraction and illegal transportation.Sand extraction from the riverbeds in CRZ areas was in vogue earlier too, but on a smaller scale catering to the local requirements. Local fishermen as well as river-front residents had deployed small boats for the purpose. However, escalated demand for sand from Bengaluru and other States had resulted in deployment of heavy steel boats and engaging workers from northern India have spelt doom to the fragile eco-system in the coastal region.
