Social activist and advocate K.P. Sripal has urged the State government to float tenders for the repair work on Bhadra reservoir as per the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act.Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (KNNL) floated tenders for the work — which includes repair and maintenance of spillway crest gates, sluice gates of the dam, de-watering the stilling basin and repairing its damaged portion, treatment to the wall through silica fume concrete and renovation of electrical system of gantry crane — on November 30, 2015. December 5 is the last date for submission of bids.According to the KTPP Act, the period of tender for the works with estimated cost of below Rs. 2 crore is 30 days and for works exceeding Rs. 2 crore is 60 days. The completion of tender process in haste is against the existing law, he said at a press conference here on Saturday.The walls of the dams have developed minor cracks in many places and there was technical problem with one crest gate, owing to which there is leakage of 150-200 cusecs of water daily from the reservoir. He said that even though the government spends around Rs. 3 crore every year for maintenance of the reservoir, the leakage has continued owing to which farmers in command areas were facing scarcity of water. The government should ensure that by floating tenders as per the KTPP Act, the contract of the work of repair and maintenance of reservoir should be handed over to a reputed company with technical expertise to resolve the problem permanently, he said.
