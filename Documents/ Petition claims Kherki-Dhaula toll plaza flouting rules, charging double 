: Taking cognisance of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed against the Kherki Dhaula toll plaza management for not issuing “toll fee” tickets valid for 24 hours like other toll plazas, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a “Notice of Motion” to the National Highway Authority of India, the Centre and the Millennium City Expressways, which manages the Kherki Dhaula toll plaza.RTI activist Aseem Takyar, who filed the PIL, said: “There is a notification of the NHAI, which states that there should be 24-hour valid ticket pattern, but the Kherki Dhaula toll plaza is issuing toll fee ticket of single journey. For instance, if I go to Manesar I have to spend Rs.60 and while coming back to Gurgaon, I have to again pay Rs.60. As per notification they should charge only Rs.80 to Rs.85 for return journey and the ticket should be valid for 24 hours.”“The management at toll plaza situated at NH-8 are charging the toll fee as per their own choice and they are not following the rules issued by the NHAI, the charging of toll fee and issuing only one way journey ticket by this toll plaza is wrong and illegal,” the petition further said.The petitioner also maintained that the toll violated a clause that states that no toll plaza could be established within 10 km from the municipal limits.
