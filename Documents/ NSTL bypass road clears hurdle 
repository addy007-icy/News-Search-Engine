With considerable headway in the formation of a bypass road from NSTL, traffic bottlenecks may ease at NAD Kotha Road for people going towards Gopalapatnam and beyond. This apart, it will also provide easy access to areas in between on the new road.The proposal has been hanging fire for a long time.Visakhapatnam West MLA P.G.V.R. Naidu (Ganababu), who made a visit to the area along with GVMC officials, told The Hindu that a survey would be undertaken after which formation of road would be taken up.Offering an alternative site close by to the NSTL has paved the way for the road proposal to make headway, says the MLA.“Earlier, the alternative land offered during the tenure of Union Minister D. Purandeswari was near INS Kalinga, which NSTL did not agree to. Now, with the NSTL ready to accept the land nearby, the hitch has been overcome,” Mr. Ganababu said.A new compound wall has to be constructed for the NSTL as a part of the work. The road, once formed, will connect to the 100-ft. road between Gopalapatnam petrol station and Gosala presently executed by the VUDA.Forming the road will provide direct access to residents of Indiranagar, Lakshminagar, and Susarla Colony. People coming from Vepagunta, Simhachalam, and Pendurti areas also may directly reach the highway bypassing NAD, a bottleneck. Beginning with the survey, the process of forming an alternative road would be taken up.Devasthanam landto be given to NSTLThe Ministry of Defence has given its approval for handing over the NSTL land in lieu of an equivalent land to lay the new road. Earlier, the locations of land offered were away from the NSTL and not acceptable to the organisation as it had to maintain separate watch and ward staff for it.To tide over the problem, land belonging to the Simhachalam Devasthanam will be given to the NSTL, say sources. .
