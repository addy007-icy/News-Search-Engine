The BCCI president Shashank Manohar will leave for Dubai on Saturday for a series of ICC meetings from January 31. He will chair the ICC Board and other important committee meetings for the first time since becoming the BCCI president on October 5 last year. By virtue of being the president, the Nagpur-based lawyer also became the ICC chairman following the BCCI’s decision to replace the first chairman, N Srinivasan.Manohar’s term will end in June this year, but having made public his opinion about the governance structure and other matters related to sharing of the revenue, the cricket fraternity worldwide is watching with interest the decisions he will take in two or three Board meetings. Sources said that the majority of the ICC’s 10 full-member countries are backing him on several issues related to conflict of interest in the ICC and also to revise the venue-sharing pattern. But will Manohar walk the extra mile?The architect of the previous governance structure — BCCI, Cricket Australia (CA) and England Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had worked out an arrangement that entailed a remittance of an initial 22 per cent of the annual ICC revenue (from 2016 to 2023) to the BCCI and another additional four per cent after all expenses are paid. The CA and ECB were projected to get between 3 and 5 per cent. In an interview to this newspaper, Manohar had expressed disappointment saying that the “major countries should not bully the ICC”.The ICC chairman is likely to meet full-member country representatives separately before he takes the chair to preside over the ICC Board and other committee meetings.At a promotional event here on Thursday, the ICC Chief Executive, David Richardson told The Hindu that “the ICC chairman has suggested some constitutional changes and the same will be discussed soon”.A few ICC full-members have already met Manohar after his first visit to the ICC office in Dubai in November last year.The officials of Zimbabwe Cricket met him here on January 5.
