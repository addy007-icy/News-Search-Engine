: Change in climate has led to a spurt in dry skin-related ailments. Dermatologists say ailments caused by excessive dryness of the skin have more than doubled this season.“Never before have I seen such large numbers of dryness-related cases. I seriously ascribe it to climatic changes,” said M.K. Sreebiju, dermatologist at Tirurangadi Taluk Hospital. “I get more than 200 cases a day. Over 90 per cent of them are dryness-related,” said Dr. Sreebiju.Dermatologists this paper contacted in Perinthalmanna, Kottakkal and Malappuram regions too concurred with Dr. Sreebiju’s views. They said dry-skin diseases were normally a problem during cold weather, but there has been a spurt this season.It is largely confined to elders and children. Asteatotic eczema or winter itch, forefeet eczema, fissuring of fingers, toes and foot soles are the main ailments. Medical shop owners here said there has been a spurt in demand for eczema-related medicines and emollients.Doctors, however said there was nothing to worry. Lack of awareness of tackling dryness had complicated the problems, they said, and advised using oils, lotions or emollients and wearing footwear.K.T. Ashique and Bindu Sudarshan, dermatologists practising at Perinthalmanna and Kottakkal respectively, said guarding the feet with a pair of quality footwear was the best way out. Dr. Bindu said people should drink more water and take regular bath during the season. “It is better to avoid applying oil before bath,” she said.Fatima Sherin, dermatologist at MES Medical College, said climate change has had a severe impact on people’s skin.
