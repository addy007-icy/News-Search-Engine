An anti-corruption court here on Wednesday heard that the SNDP Yogam leadership was responsible for the suspected fraud in the distribution of micro-credit to underprivileged backward class families through self-help groups.Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan’s counsel had made the case against SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan, president M.N. Soman and micro-finance coordinator K.K. Maheshan. Mr. Achuthanandan had also named former managing director of Kerala State Backward Classes Development Corporation N. Najib as respondent in the case.In response to queries from the Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) John K. Illikadan, Mr. Achuthanandan’s counsel said the SNDP unions (district units) had distributed the credit. However, they had done so under the strict instructions of the Yogam leadership.He said that a VACB confidential inquiry into the allegations in 2007 had revealed discrepancies in the micro credit disbursal accounts amounting to Rs.80 lakh.The inquiry had found that the Corporation had released micro credit funds through unions without verifying the genuineness of the beneficiaries.No fund utilisation certificates were sought. The inquiry had recommended department action against the then Corporation chairman.The anti-corruption court was considering Mr. Achuthanandan’s plea that Mr. Natesan be prosecuted on charges of fraud, embezzlement, and graft in connection with the fund utilisation.Micro-creditThe aim of the Yogam’s flag ship scheme was to provide micro-credit to its members through its 1,000 odd self-help groups (SHGs). However, he alleged that Mr. Natesan had turned the scheme into a money-lending operation that personally benefitted him and his coterie.They charged exorbitant interest rates (12 per cent as against the permissible 5 per cent) from debtors and deliberately defaulted on mortgage repayment to keep the money for themselves.They invented fictitious beneficiaries and forged documents, including fund utilisation certificates, to avail themselves of loans at a nominal two per cent interest rate in the name of non-existent backward class SHG members supposedly living in abject poverty, he alleged.With official connivanceA set of corrupt officials in the Kerala State Backward Classes Commission helped the coterie amass wealth at the expense of “poor Ezhava families.”They did not verify the genuineness of beneficiaries. Nor did they check the rate of interest charged by the SNDP. Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes Minister A.P. Anil Kumar backed them, he alleged.The officials accepted without question the records furnished by the Yogam. Nationalised banks which disbursed loans to SHG members on the guarantee of the Yogam were also swindled.The court would decide on January 20 whether to accept or reject Mr. Achuthanandan’s plea for a criminal inquiry against Mr. Natesan and his office-bearers.Case against SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan, president M.N.
