The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday accused Uttarakhand’s Congress government of trying to benefit real estate companies by constructing smart city on tea estates.Party workers held a demonstration at the proposed site to protest the state government’s move.Leading the protest demonstration, AAP leader Anoop Nautiyal alleged that the State government’s decision was aimed at helping corporate giants.Mr Nautiyal claimed that he has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to reject the State’s smart city proposal.The proposed Smart City project on the tea estate land has already drawn opposition from the BJP and environmentalists besides the locals and plantation workers.Chief Minister Harish Rawat had earlier made it clear that the ‘Smart City’ project would be taken up on the tea estates due to non-availability of suitable land elsewhere. However, Mr Rawat had assured welfare of the workers and residents of the area and a major part of the proposed Smart City will be left as ‘green cover’. -- PTI
