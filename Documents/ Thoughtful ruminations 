‘Atma Vichara’ means ruminating on the nature of one’s existence in a holistic manner, say the sastras. To a jivatma the body is tangible and he identifies himself with it easily, thinking it is a permanent possession and a great asset.Tirumangai Azhwar captures the philosophy of life and hereafter when he states that by God’s grace he is now aware of the inner self that is known as the “atma” and of the still subtler “Paramatma” who resides in the atma as a witness. The Azhwar feels despondent about the time lost during his brief lifetime and now seeks His feet in total surrender to be relieved from the clutches of samsara, pointed out Sri Muralidhara Swamigal in a discourse.The body is a dwelling place, made of walls of flesh and blood. The pillars are made of bones. The human hair becomes the roof of the building that conforms to the vastu sastra of nine gates.In this house, the jivatma who is the kshetrajna is allowed to dwell. The Paramatma also resides along with the jivatma. Yet the jivatma easily forgets the antecedents of his existence. There is no contact with the Paramatma because of whom this benefit was given. Instead there is only ahamkara and mamakara.The time is wasted on decking and adorning the body and eating and nourishing the body. In due course, the body weakens, the senses fail and all the workings of the body diminish. Should not one seek the help of the Paramatma who dwells along with the atma? Azhwar shows that surrender to the Lord is the only way, for He alone can lead us out of this birth during our last moments. The Lord dwells equally in every being and this body is for the sake of the Lord and not for the individual atma.
