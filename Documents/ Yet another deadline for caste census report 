The State government on Monday once again extended the deadline, by two months, for the Karnataka Backward Classes Commission (KBCC) to submit its report and recommendations on the caste census conducted in April 2015.The deadlines fixed by the government for submission of the report lapsed thrice and this is the fourth extension.According to statistics made available to the media, while 16 districts have sent in their reports, 14 are way behind in submitting the final report on the caste data. “Deputy Commissioners of the districts, who failed to expedite the process, have been cautioned that they would be held responsible for the delay,” said Minister for Social Welfare H. Anjaneya.Mr. Anjaneya attributed the delay to the polls to gram panchayat, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and Legislative Council elections held in recent months. He said the commission will submit its report and recommendations based on the data collected from the Socio-Educational and Economic Survey (caste census) to the government in the next two months.The government and the commission are facing flak over the delay, even 10 months after conducting the census.Sources in the commission told The Hindu that it will need at least two months to tabulate, analyse and conclude the report, and make recommendations. “The process gained momentum in the last 15 days,” said an official source.Progress updateTotal population: 5,97,35,193Total number of households: 1,35,15,440Enumeration forms yet to be corrected: 52,747
