A woman Maoist commander was killed and eight others surrendered before police in different parts of restive Bastar region of Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. “An encounter took place between the police and the Maoists between 12 to 12.45 pm today near Bayanar forest of Bijapur district. A woman Maoist commander was killed during the encounter and one 12-bore rifle, one locally made gun and heavy Maoist dumb was recovered from the spot of the encounter,” said statement issued by the police.An official claimed that the number of casualties could be more on the Maoists side as they could be seen dragging dead bodies inside the forest. In a separate incident, eight “Maoists” surrendered before the police in Naraynpur district of Bastar. The surrendered Maoists include two women.The Bastar police, on Tuesday, sent an IAF chopper to Bijapur to bring an injured Maoist to Jagadalpur district headquarters for treatment. “A chopper was sent to Bijapur today to bring Linga Sori, a Maoist who was injured and arrested during Pedia encounter on Monday, for better medical treatment. He will be admitted to Mecoz hospital in Jagadalpur. This gesture from the police will shut the mouths of those so-called human rights activists who term the police-Maoist encounters as fake and at times call the Maoists as innocents,” Bastar district Superintendent of Police, Mr.R.N.Das said in a statement.
