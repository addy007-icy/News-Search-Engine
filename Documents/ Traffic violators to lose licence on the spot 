raffic rule violations will now lead to on-the-spot suspension of driving licences for three months.The State transport department, in collaboration with the traffic police, will launch a campaign against traffic rule violators on Mumbai’s roads from Wednesday.Around 30 teams comprising personnel from both the traffic police and the transport department will patrol the roads of Mumbai to ensure traffic rules are complied with and violators face immediate action. According to the State’s Transport Minister Divakar Raote, these teams will also supervise areas such as Thane, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai and Vasai, which are adjacent to Mumbai.The decision of a campaign was taken in a review meeting held on Tuesday to plan ‘Road Safety Abhiyaan’.“The campaign is to ensure that the traffic rules are not violated and those who do it learn a lesson. All those who are found breaking the laws will have their licenses suspended for three months on the spot,” said Mr Raote.The list of offences include over speeding, breaking signal, overloading goods cars, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and transporting passengers in goods carriers.Last week, Mr Raote had said the State will be making requests to the courts where these cases are produced first and seek jail custody for the offender, in addition to suspension of the licence.While the campaign is to ensure that motorists follow traffic rules, Mr Raote said that bikes making noise above permissible limit will also come under scrutiny during the campaign.Tightening the regulations, the government has issued notifications making it compulsory to wear helmet for two-wheeler riders throughout the State. “Those who are found guilty of not wearing helmet or buckle seat belt will have to undergo mandatory counseling of two hours,” Mr Raote said.
