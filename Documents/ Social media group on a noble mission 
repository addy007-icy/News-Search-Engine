Come February, and Ernakulam will have 82 clean ponds capable of meeting water requirements of several local communities.The Ente Kulam project being implemented by the volunteers of Anbodu Kochi, a social media-based group that shot to fame with its committed relief work for the victims of the recent Chennai floods, is expected to be on the fast track mode from next week.On Sunday, the volunteers led by District Collector M.G. Rajamanickam cleaned four abandoned ponds in Udayamperoor, Thiruvaniyur, Maneedu and Chottanikkara. The project took off on January 10 after the team cleaned up a pond in Chittethukara near Kakkanad.“We will scale up the project implementation by cleaning up about 16 ponds next Sunday. Our team has now learnt the cleaning process and could finish the work by February,” said Bimal Vas, a volunteer of Anbodu Kochi. The collective aims at not only improving the quality of water resources in the district, but also involving local communities in conservation initiatives.
