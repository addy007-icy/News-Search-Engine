A number of reasons, including paucity of funds and inadequate coordination among government departments, have brought the drive against encroachments on lakes around Tambaram to a halt.Sources in the Water Resources Department (WRD) told The Hindu that they needed funds to hire earthmoving equipment and engage workers to bring down the encroachments.Residents pointed out that while unauthorised structures in Perungalathur, Mannivakkam, Varadharajapuram and Mudichur were brought down, a handful of them that had encroached on Rajakilpakkam and Sembakkam Lakes were spared. “The drive against encroachments should continue if lakes here have to be protected,” a resident of Selaiyur said.
