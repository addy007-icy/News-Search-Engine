A group of auto-rickshaw drivers will march down to the Delhi Secretariat on Friday. The rally will be against what their representatives claim are “irregularities” in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s position towards them. This is in addition to demanding the issuance of around 13,000 additional permits as per directions of the Supreme Court.Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh general secretary Rajendra Soni said the union called on Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung during the day in relation to the way forward in an alleged scam related to the issuance of permits to auto-rickshaw drivers late last year. The rally is expected to draw between 200 and 500 participants.“We will converge at Rajghat from where we will proceed towards the Delhi Secretariat; we also called on the L-G today demanding that investigation in the recent scam be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” Mr. Soni said.“We will also march against the Transport Department’s treatment towards auto-rickshaw drivers against whom the Traffic Police has recently been empowered to seize driver’s licenses for as many as three months thus leaving them with no means to earn their livelihoods,” he added.Mr. Soni also said that the government was lagging way behind in ensuring that as many as 35,000 new autos were allowed to ply on the Capital’s streets despite Supreme Court directions to the effect that the number of such vehicles be increased to one lakh, in a directive issued in November 2011.
