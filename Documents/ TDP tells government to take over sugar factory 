TDP district president Arkala Narsa Reddy urged the government to lift the lay-off of the Nizam Deccan Sugars Limited (formerly Nizam Sugar Factory) at Bodhan and run the factory for the benefit of workers and cane farmers. Addressing the roadside meetings held as part of the ‘padayatra’ undertaken by the sugarcane farmers and TDP activists from Kotagiri to Varni, the former MLC pointed out that TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao had promised in public election meetings that soon after he came to power his government would take over the factory from private management within 100 days.However, he ignored the promise and allowed the management to declare the lay-off, he said, and wanted to know as to what was the secret behind the government’s inaction on the NDSL’s future. To bring pressure on the government, the party plans to launch padayatras in Bodhan and Banswada Assembly constituencies next month and stage dharna on a big scale before the factory in Bodhan.Party Banswada constituency in-charge Badya Nayak also spoke.
