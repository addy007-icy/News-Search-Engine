Given the chance to lay the ‘milestone’ issue to rest, Glenn Maxwell, on Thursday, instead stoked the fire further, this time suggesting that India’s batsmen had chased individual glory at the expense of the team’s success.“I knew it (my earlier remark) was going to blow up,” he said at the team hotel here.“It didn’t really bother me. I was sent a photo the other day, it said: Virat (in Canberra) was 84 off 63 [61], and then 100 off 89 [84], or something like that. He got his last 11 runs off 22 balls [21] to get to his hundred. I thought about that and I was like, ‘Jeez he did it so easily all the way up until then, and then you just lose a bit of momentum’.“Then you look, on the other hand, when you watch David Warner get into the nineties and try to slog sweep Ishant Sharma for six.“It’s just, to me, that’s two complete different ends of the spectrum. And then you look at the scoreline and you see 4-0. And I’d much rather be 4-0 basically,” said Maxwell, who is an injury doubt for the fifth ODI to be played on Saturday.
