P.M. Kamalamma, member (Southern Region) of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), has said that the SCs are much better off in Kerala when compared to other States.Talking to mediapersons after a sitting of the NCSC here on Wednesday, Ms. Kamalamma said the commission had suggested to the State government to increase the budgetary allocation for SCs. She said the allocation of 8 per cent was based on the calculation that the State had an SC population of 8 per cent. But the SC population has increased now and so the allocation for them has to be proportionately increased.The NCSC has also suggested to the State government a hike in the education aid for SC students. She said bogus claims for SC certificates were going up in the State. Action should be taken against fake claimants as a deterrent. She said while some castes are shown under the SC category in some districts, the same castes are listed under Schedule Tribes in other districts. This discrepancy had to be sorted out, she said.
