>After entering his maiden quarterfinal, Ramkumar Ramanathan said that the vociferous support from the fans helped him in his come-from-behind win.Speaking about the second-round contest, the local lad said: “I thought in the first set I was going too much for my shots and not making more balls which made it easy for him. So in the second, I focused on keeping the ball in play and controlling my emotions. I wanted to get my first serves in, and try and win every point.“After getting the second set, I took more risks on my serve and put more effort on my second serves. I knew I could beat this guy and having the crowd behind me helped a lot.”The 21-year-old also credited the work his coach Juan Balcells has been putting in. “He has been travelling with me for tournaments, and has been telling me to not rush and take it slow, especially deep into a match. We have been working on that for a while and I just followed it today.”TNTA vice-president Karti Chidambaram, who played an important part in sending Ramkumar to the Sanchez-Casal Tennis Academy in Barcelona, said: “I am happy with the way he showed character.“We have noticed a difference when his coach Balcells is with him during tournaments and when he’s not. Our aim is to ensure that he’s with Ramkumar through the year.”Ramkumar’s father Ramanathan was ecstatic. “I have no words. I gave up hope when he lost the first, but what a fightback!”Karti, also the organising committee chairman of the Chennai Open, said the tournament’s future will be known on Sunday. The contract for the current three-year cycle ends with this edition.
