Being truthful in respect of financial aspects plays an important role.Many students obtain huge temporary cash loan at high interest rate and show it as their source of fee during visa interviews. The students tend to resort to this method under the impression that the Consulates treat the cash in bank as a capacity to fund his or her education.“This apparently is a wrong thought, as the interviewers in the Consulate actually try to ascertain a student’s capacity to raise funds. A proper bank loan stands good in such a scenario. A few students had been deported as inspection of the bank account post sanction of visa showed lack of cash,” said Mr. V.S.R.K. Prasad, Principal of Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Sciences (ANITS).According to Mr. Sasank, in such a situation, this becomes a case of fraud, and the U.S. authorities have the powers to ban entry of such students up to five years.“Some of the deported students are lucky to be given the option of ‘voluntary withdrawal’ that would allow them to apply for a new U.S. visa,” he said.
