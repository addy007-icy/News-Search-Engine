The Kalaburagi unit of the Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association has demanded that the government take up with the Maharashtra government the issue of releasing water into the Bhima river course from the Ujjini Dam to save standing sugarcane crop in thousands of acres of land in Kalaburagi and Vijayapura districts and also to address drinking water shortage in the villages on the banks of the river in the two districts.Association president Jagadish Patil Rajapur and State secretary Dattatreya M. Kulkarni told presspersons here on Sunday that the situation was alarming with the Bhima fast drying and the district authorities preventing farmers from drawing water from the riverbed by disconnecting power supply to irrigation pumpsets to save water to meet drinking water requirement of human dwellings on the banks of the river.Mr. Rajapur said that the sugarcane crop on the banks of the river was fast drying due to stoppage of water supply to the fields.The State government should immediately ask sugar factories in the district to take up sugarcane harvesting in the fields on priority and start crushing.If lack of rain in the command areas was one of the reasons for the Bhima drying up so early this year, another reason was the illegal extraction of sand in the riverbed.He charged the Union and State governments with being hand-in-glove with the managements of sugar factories.A majority of sugar factories continued to defy the diktats of the governments on the payment of sugarcane prices as per the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the Union government.Mr. Rajapur said that the State government had failed to fix price for sugarcane this year and the factories were also not paying price as per the Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 2,650 per tonne for 2015-16. They were paying around Rs. 1,500 per tonne, he added.The governments had done very little to exert pressure on sugar factories to clear dues of sugarcane growers.In Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the combined dues for 2014-15 and 2015-16 from sugar factories stood at Rs. 132 crore.The Bhima riverbed is fast drying up, says State sugarcane growers' association
