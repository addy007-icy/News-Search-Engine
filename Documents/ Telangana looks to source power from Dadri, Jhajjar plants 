The Delhi government’s appeal for surrendering surplus power may finally be heard with Telangana looking to avail the electricity produced at Dadri and Jhajjar power plants.At present, a major chunk of power produced at these two plants has been allocated to the Capital. Now, with Telangana expressing interest in procuring power from these units for a year, the Aam Aadmi Party government has written to the Union Power Ministry asking it to reallocate power from NTPC’s Dadri Thermal Power Station and Aravali Power Company Limited’s plant in Jhajjar to the State.“Delhi is presently power surplus and the Govt of NCT of Delhi has been requesting the Ministry of Power, Govt of India, for surrender of surplus power. Therefore, the instant proposal of Telangana State Power Coordination Committee is in the interest of all parties concerned as on one hand the power deficit state of Telangana will get the requisite power and on the other hand consumers of Delhi will get relief from the burden of fixed cost of surplus power,” read the letter written by Principal Secretary (Power) Sukesh Jain on Tuesday.The offer from Telangana assumes significance for the Capital as the Delhi government had urged the Centre in earlier letters to permanently surrender 2,255 MW of electricity provided by 11 central government power plants. The list also included Delhi’s share of 693 MW from APPCL Jhajjar (Aravali) and 735 MW from Dadri Stage-II (Thermal), which may now go to the new-born Southern State.According to discom Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL), which supplies power to North and North West Delhi, if approximately 600 MW of reallocation is done for one year from Aravali, Dadri 1 and Dadri 2; the same would correspond to savings worth Rs. 735 crore. “This would translate to a reduction of approximately 70 to 80 paise in the power purchase cost per unit. The calculations consider total power as 600 MW from these three stations, Rs.5 per unit as the total cost in Rs. per unit, and that TPDDL will take at least 70 per cent power from these stations based on technical limit and Rs. 3 as the sale rate,” said a discom official.At present, a major chunk of power that is being produced at the Dadri and Jhajjar plants is being allocated to the Capital
