It rained medals for Madras Boat Club (MBC) at the 74th ARAE–FEARA Regatta hosted by the College of Military Engineering (CME) at Pune recently. The world-class venue and the excellent facilities proved inspiring as the MBC rowers clinched the top spot in Willingdon Fours, Macklin Sculls and Venables Bowl apart from winning the Hoogly Cup (maximum points in the men’s section) and the newly-introduced CME Trophy (overall title).If the triumph in the ‘Duel in the Crown’ was prestigious, the victory in Macklin was a special one. The Fours event saw MBC pip CME, a powerhouse in such duels, at the post. “Since we are used to training at the Adyar river which is heavier due to specific gravity and other man-made factors, the CME course felt lighter and the boys were quicker,” said R. Krishna Mohan, who won two silver medals in the Double Sculls and Pairs’ races of the Super Masters category (age 50-plus).Abraham Kandathil, MBC’s Captain of Boats, added that the “unprecedented victory” over CME at its home course was made possible by the intensive training of the crews.For the single sculls competition, there was a special invitee: Rahul Baliga. The 29-year-old flew all the way from Canada, where he currently stays, to take part in the race. His passion and determination were to the fore as Rahul helped MBC regain the Macklin trophy after a gap of a decade.
