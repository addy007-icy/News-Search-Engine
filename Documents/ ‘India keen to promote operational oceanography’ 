India is keen to promote operational oceanography as it plays an important role in translating benefits of science to the common man, said Union Minister of State for Science and Technology, Y S Chowdhary here on Monday.Laying the foundation stone for ‘International Training Centre for Operational Oceanography’ (ITCO-Ocean) at the ESSO-Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), he cited the examples of Potential Fishing Zone advisories to fishermen, ocean state forecasts for mariners and Tsunami and storm surges early warnings. Since INCOIS was already at the forefront of such operational services, Government of India chose to establish ITCO-Ocean here, he added. He said the Ministry of Earth Sciences has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with IOC/ UNESCO to cooperate in capacity development programmes.This shows the confidence of international community in India’s achievements, particularly in the field of oceanography.The new building, expected to be ready in 18 months, will impart training to participants from all over the world, according to an INCOIS release here.
