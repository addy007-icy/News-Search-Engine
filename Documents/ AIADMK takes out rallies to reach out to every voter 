In an effort to reach out to 5.63 crore voters, the ruling AIADMK’s cadre took to the streets in thousands on Wednesday across the State.Apart from taking out massive rallies in 50 party districts, the AIADMK cadre, most of them wearing a T-shirt with party supremo Jayalalithaa’s pictures, met the people not just in their homes, but in markets, tea shops, bus stops, wedding halls and almost everywhere.The AIADMK cadre took along with them a colourful booklet listing out the various achievements of the government. As many as 65,616 vote canvassers have been appointed, one for each of the polling booths, and their mandate is to reach out to everyone in that particular booth “as many times as possible” along with the local partymen. M. Khanna, a canvasser in Tondiarpet, said he will visit homes that are known to be sympathisers of other parties too. “They will ask people if they have received the benefits that Amma had promised them,” said a senior leader in Jayalalithaa Peravai, which has undertaken this exercise.Meanwhile, Ms. Jayalalithaa announced that the party's IT wing will hold district-level conferences from January 9 to 26.
