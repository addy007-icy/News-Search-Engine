Thanks to the recent monsoon, gridlocks have now become commonplace, resulting in unprecedented traffic jams and absurd durations of commute. Though we see hundreds of others stuck in the traffic, we believe that only we are in a hurry to reach our destination.While some chaos is inevitable during such large scale gridlocks, some commuters seem to create panic on the roads. The most important thing to avoid when stuck in a traffic jam is incessant honking. The sound horn has an important role to play and ought to be used judiciously. With cars at a standstill, it is absolutely futile to honk. Honking in a traffic jam only adds to the noise pollution and agitates an already irascible crowd.Those stationed behind other vehicles at a traffic signal often keep honking, sometimes forcing those in front to jump the signal. One must, however, honk to alert other drivers when the need arises. For instance, some may be unaware that the signal has turned green or someoneâ€™s vehicle may roll back down an inconspicuous slope.In a near city-wide gridlock, one must remain patient and see how best they can cooperate with others to exit the roads. Several drivers make decisions to turn at the very last minute, often after being dissuaded by the sight of a long line-up of vehicles. This can be detrimental to those behind. Road users are dangerously unaware of braking distance and requisite gap between vehicles. Hence, it is important that drivers use the appropriate indicators before making their move.The most useful of them is the tail light or brake light. The tail lights brighten up when the driver brakes, and therefore we must ensure they are functioning properly at all times. Some vehicles have defunct brake lights, which not only deems the vehicle unfit but also poses a threat to others. vikram.mankal@gmail.com
