The Director, Medical Education, Ramla Beevi, on Wednesday held marathon meetings with all the department heads and teachers at the Government Medical College, Ernakulam, on various issues related to the college here.The government has to rectify the issues pointed out by the Medical Council of India during the last inspection as MCI team had recommended students’ admissions last year only on government’s assurance on this count. Since the college could be inspected by a team from MCI anytime before admission process begins for the new academic session, the DME would be giving a detailed report on the shortcomings here.All departments listed their requirements in terms of shortage of staff and equipment. The college also has to be provided better staff strength in five departments with post-graduation courses. The problem of not having a proper department for any super specialty in spite of being a 15-year old college is yet another issue in the institution.Sources in the medical college said that the college with ‘stand-alone status’ would require more contract hands to meet the doctors’ shortage.Faculty from other medical colleges could not be transferred here since there are no posts created for them. There are only posts created to accommodate the personnel already working here before the integration process began.All departments list their requirements in terms of shortage of staff and equipment.
