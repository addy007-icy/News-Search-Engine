From a clay station for children to hand-made studio pottery and workshops on ceramics and Japanese Raku ware, the second edition of the Auroville International Potters’ Market (January 23-26) will explore aesthetic possibilities of the art.The maiden edition last year was a successful event attracting 38 potters from places such as Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune and Goa.The event showcased the versatility of the medium across products that ranged from the utilitarian to the fancy, and objects that merged both aesthetics and functionality.Billed as an annual event exclusively for practising studio potters and ceramic artists, the Auroville International Potters’ Market will in its second edition bring together 28 pottery practitioners from across the country.For the key persons behind this show like Ange Peter, who runs Forest Pottery in Auroville, the potters’ market is an important way to keep the craft alive.Potters also get to meet their clientele and also exchange tips with peers.Two ceramic workshops are also being held as part of the market this year — a 10-day crash course on Haiyu slipware, a technique unique in the otherwise common bowl of ceramic knowledge by Ms. Peter and another on the Japanese Raku (bowl) by Jane Malvisi.
