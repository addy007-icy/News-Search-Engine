Chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Women Manjula Manasa and Commissioner of Mysuru city police B. Dayanand differed on handling family disputes cases and domestic violence at a workshop on women’s safety here on Tuesday.The commissioner in his speech said that police could not visit each house and hear the grievances of the couple and sort out their problems.He said that police would normally not register cases in family disputes in the first stage giving time for the couples to compromise adopting “forgive and forget’ policy.Even after giving certain time to the couple to reconcile, if the couple continued to quarrel each other, the police would register case and take appropriate action.Ms. Manasa, who spoke before the Commissioner, did not get an opportunity to express her views on the remarks of Dayanand at the inaugural session.However, during the technical session held after the inaugural function, she said that neither the commission nor any one would expect the police to visit houses and mediate the ‘quarrelling couples’.What the commission expect the police to do is to behave properly with the women complainants at the police stations, she said.Inaugurating the workshop Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru C. Shikha said that many social evils continued to prevail.She said that she had noticed that many couples in H.D. Kote who got married at a young age and the authorities could not take action as the couples had no issues and were living happily ever after.Hence the authorities were engaged in creating awareness among people about negative aspect of child marriages and the authorities have kept a constant vigil all over the choultries to prevent performing child marriages.The DC said that one stop centre had been set up at the KR hospital for rape victims enabling the victims to get all the facilities under one roof.She noted that apart from medical examination and counselling, complaints can be lodged at the centre besides getting a free legal aid from the District Legal Services Authority. Collection of forensic evidence and providing psychological counselling by professions were also provided at the centre, she said.Mr. Dayanand said that police have taken a lot of care while filing or initiating action regarding domestic violence and family disputes as it would have a negative impact on the minds of the young children of the couple.The delay in registering cases particularly in family disputes or domestic violence should not be mistaken, he said, adding that police deliberately adopt ‘go slow’ policy in these cases.Workshop on women’s safety was organised by the women’s commission
