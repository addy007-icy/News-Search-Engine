The city police, on Saturday, sent jitters among moneylenders and finance agencies, with surprise checks on their firms and houses.The special team of officers conducted raids at six places in the city and found blank cheques, promissory notes and other documents related to financial transactions. Financial firms and houses of financiers, who earned by lending money for highinterest rates, were raided.According to the police, houses in Saraswathipuram, Salagame Road, Kuvempu Nagar and Pension Mohalla were raided. The police said that the raids were conducted based on complaints filed by the public against money-lenders charging exorbitant interest rates.

He had left behind a note blaming money-lenders for him taking the extreme step.The police would take further action after going through the documents seized during the raids, Superintendent of Police Raman Gupta told presspersons.
