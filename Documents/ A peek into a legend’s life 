To celebrate artist Satish Gujral’s 90th birthday, the Gujral Foundation has put up a show curated by Pramod K.G. with 70 of his works — detailing his journey as an artist and showcasing the diversity of his artistic career — on display.The retrospective titled ‘A Brush With Life’ is a celebration of the many hats the artist has donned — as a painter, muralist, sculptor and architect.The exhibition offers a rare opportunity to peek into Gujral’s life and understand his works as a parallel to his experiences and the influences on him during his training as an artist.The exhibition, which is deeply personal, helps the viewer connect with Gujral the artist and the child who lost his hearing when he was eight years old, besides the change and vibrancy a cochlear implant six decades later brought to his work. Gujral is one of the few artists who has painted human conditions and emotions during the Partition.The exhibition begins with his oldest surviving works, popularly called the Partition Paintings, that are filled with grief and shock.The exhibition begins with Gujral's oldest surviving works, popularly called the Partition Paintings, that are filled with grief and shock
