It may not be visible to your eyes like many other security gadgets. But in times of emergency, it comes up from under the ground and prevents access to the high-security zones.The upcoming international terminal of the Cochin International Airport Limited, slated for inauguration later next month, will be guarded by an additional layer of electro-hydraulic bollards and tyre killers. Kochi airport is the first in the State to get the Rs.11-crore gadget, which may soon come up at other airports in the State. At present, only two other airports in South India – Bangalore and Hyderabad – have the system.“We should be ready with the gadget with the commissioning of the new terminal. It will be installed at three of the airside-entry gates in addition to the one on the flyover, leading to the new terminal,” a top CIAL official told The Hindu .Tyre-killer is an electrically operated spike obstruction that emerges above ground level on receiving a valid input signal and prevents unauthorised entry. The moment a vehicle tries to forcibly enter without permission or a check, it will start working at the push of a button, and deflate the vehicle’s tyres and block its entry.Though CIAL has deployed CISF guards at all the entry points to regulate the movement of vehicles, the area is still considered vulnerable to forceful entries.CCTV camerasWith the new terminal adding up an additional floor area of 15 lakh square feet, an additional set of 2,500 high definition CCTV cameras will be installed inside the new building. Similarly, biometric access control systems will be installed to monitor the entry of CIAL staff and employees of various agencies inside the terminals as well as to the various sensitive areas inside the airport. The airport company also plans to install a modern Perimeter Intrusion Detection System along its 17- kilometre-long airport boundary to ensure live surveillance with the support of real-time visuals. “We have already submitted a proposal in this regard to the Director General of Civil Aviation and will initiate the tendering process upon receiving the mandatory clearances,” the official added.The airport boundary wall has residential areas just abutting it at some locations and the real-time visuals of intrusion will help the security guards prepare a measured response.
