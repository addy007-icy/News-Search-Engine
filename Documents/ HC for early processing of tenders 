The Kerala High Court on Tuesday observed that the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) should streamline the tender process in connection with Sabarimala season.Justice Muhamed Mustaque observed that in several cases, the awarding of contracts happened just before the commencement of the season.The court issued the directive when a writ petition filed by Jacob T. Abraham, managing director of a packaged drinking water firm from Ernakulam, against the awarding of the tender for supply of packaged drinking water and soft drinks at the Sannidhanam and Nilackal to a Thiruvalla-based company.The court said there could not be any infirmity with respect to the award of contract for supplying drinking water at the Sannidhanam. The TDB had re-tendered the contract with the intention to fetch higher rate.However, there was a serious issue with respect to awarding the contract for Nilackal. It had been awarded to the Thiruvalla-based company which did not take part in the tender process. The TDB had justified the award citing paucity of time for a re-notification.The court referred the case to the Devaswom Bench.
