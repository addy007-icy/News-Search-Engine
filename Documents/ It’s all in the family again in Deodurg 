The Deodurg Assembly constituency is known for bitter electoral battles between members of a single family from Arakera village. And the forthcoming byelection, necessitated by the death of A. Venkatesh Naik, is going to be no exception.While the Congress has almost decided to field V. Rajashekhar Naik, son of Venkatesh Naik, the Bharatiya Janata Party is banking on K. Shivanagouda Naik, grandson of the dead leader. While the Congress is heavily dependent on sympathy wave among voters that was high after the death of Venkatesh Naik, the BJP is relying on Mr. Shivanagouda Naik’s personal and entrenched influence. The JD(S) is yet to finalise its contestant.CM’s public meetingsThe Congress held two huge public meetings in Deodurg in the last one month, which were addressed by the Chief Minister himself. The first meeting on December 17 last year was a part of the party’s campaign for the election to the Legislative Council from Raichur–Koppal Local Authorities constituency. The party chose neither Koppal nor Raichur for organising the event, but it chose Deodurg. The second one, on January 1, was organised under the pretext of laying the foundation stone for various development works. For the Congress, the recent victory in Raichur–Koppal Local Authorities constituency is a morale booster.In a bitter battle in the 2008 Assembly elections, Mr. Shivanagouda Naik contested on JD(S) ticket and defeated his grandfather Venkatesh Naik. He then joined the BJP and won the byelection by defeating his uncle B.V. Naik (now Raichur Lok Sabha member).In the 2013 Assembly elections, Mr. Shivanagouda Naik he was defeated by Venkatesh Naik. He was again defeated by Mr. B.V. Naik in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Now, he is trying his luck in the byelection by facing Mr. Rajashekhar Naik (Venkatesh Naik’s son and B.V. Naik’s brother).
