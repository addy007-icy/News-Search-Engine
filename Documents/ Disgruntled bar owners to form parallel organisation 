The members of the Kerala Bar Hotels Association (KBHA) disgruntled with the methods of its leadership have turned rebellious and are planning to form a parallel organisation.A group of 40 members has called for a meeting of like-minded people to discuss the future course of action at BTH Sarovaram in Maradu on Sunday at 3 p.m.They have also threatened to make public at the meeting the money they have paid to the KBHA leadership for various purposes.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Shaji C.K., a former bar hotel owner, said that effectively the KBHA had ceased to exist since only five-star hotels, permitted to run bars, alone technically remained its members.“We have lost trust in the KBHA leadership who have failed to convene either the executive committee or the general body meeting despite repeated pleas. Neither has the leadership produced the account statements showing how much money collected from the members were utilised. The industry is in doldrums and many among us are neck deep in debt and facing revenue recovery,” he said. They said that they were neither for nor against the State government but only wanted the closed down bars to be reopened.The meeting will select the office-bearers of the new organisation and discuss the scope of impleading in bar-related cases under way in various vigilance courts.
