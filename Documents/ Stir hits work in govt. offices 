Slogan shouting protesters supporting the strike had taken their position at both main entrances to the civil station from morning. Out of the 163 employees at the collectorate, only 68 turned up. A protest march led by leaders including G. Motilal, State president of the CPI-affiliated Joint Council, was taken out by the employees.
