It is not just the art aficionados who are an excited lot with Thiruvananthapuram turning host to the 56th State School Arts Festival.With a lot of people planning to stay put here until the fest curtains come down, including the around 12,000 participants, the seven-day event has been a boon to the city hotels, particularly budget hotels, which are overflowing with guests in an otherwise lean season.Though the organisers of the festival had arranged with 13 government and private schools for accommodation, a majority of rooms in budget hotels have been sold out. “The event has come at the right time when the industry was looking for a momentum after the New Year rush. It has generated a huge demand for rooms, which has boosted occupancy level and improved sales in restaurants,” said N. Harikrishnan, general manager of Hotel Chaithram.Many of those who had not booked rooms in advance courted disappointment on Tuesday with hotels turning down requests for rooms. “All our rooms were sold out well in advance. No booking can be made at least for the next three days. It’s the case with other hotels too,” he said.According to G. Sudhiesh Kumar, Advisor, Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association, more than 150 rooms have been booked by the organising committee alone to accommodate teachers, judges and other supporting staff. “It has become a bonanza for the industry,” he added.An official with Education Department, who is part of the organising committee, said participants seek the privacy in hotels instead of the general atmosphere at the centres opened for accommodation. “Students will be accompanied by the trainer and they could use the facility for last minute preparations,” the official said.In all, the city turning host for the festival almost a year after hosting the 35th National Games, which had witnessed a similarly high footfall, has brought back cheers to the industry.
