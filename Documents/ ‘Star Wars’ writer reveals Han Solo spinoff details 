Veteran “Star Wars” writer Lawrence Kasdan has shared details of the upcoming Han Solo movie, including the era it will be set in.Disney has been close-mouthed about the details of the project, for which so far more than 2,500 actors have auditioned, reported Digital Spy.According to Kasdan, the film will tell the tale of the smuggler and intergalactic chancer before he met Luke and Obi-W’an in the Mos Eisley cantina in “A New Hope”.However, he clarified it will not be an origin story.“It will not be, ‘Here’s where he was born and this is how he was raised’ I think what it will be is what was he like 10 years earlier — maybe a little earlier, you’ll get a glimpse,” the “Empire Strikes Back” writer during Q&A session.Actors like Dave Franco, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Logan Lerman, Ansel Elgort, Ed Westwick and Rami Malek are reported to have auditioned for the role of Han.The film is scheduled for release on March 25, 2018.
