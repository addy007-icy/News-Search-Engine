The BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit on Saturday accused Samajwadi Party of using ‘Asha Yatra’ (walk of hope) as a platform to campaign for upcoming State Assembly elections, a senior party official said.Slamming the SP on Saturday, BJP Kanpur chief Surendra Maithani said: “How this yatra can be an initiative to spread peace and harmony amongst people, when it was turning out to be a Samajwadi party event.“SP has put all ranks of the local district administration into preparations for this yatra in view of the upcoming Assembly elections. No one will be able to benefit from this march, nor will it improve peace and harmony of the city,” he said.“None of the BJP leaders or workers will participate in the yatra, nor will they support this,” he added.An initiative by Sri M’s ‘Manav Ekta Mission’, the ‘padayatra’ from Kanyakumari to Kashmir started on January 12 last year, marking the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.Along with district authorities, ruling SP has been engaged in repairing roads and footpaths on the way leading to the Green Park stadium, where the ‘Asha Yatra’ or the walk of hope will reach on Jan 12.Strengthening vote bank“Roads leading to the stadium have been lined with posters and banners of local SP leaders welcoming the participants of the yatra, making it an opportunity to strengthen their vote bank,” Maithani alleged.The Additional DM Avinash Singh said, “roads and footpaths have been cleaned and repaired especially for this yatra because the Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav will also be joining the event on Jan 12. Although, he will be attending the yatra only in the capacity of the State head and will not attend any other official event that day.“It is wrong to label it as a government yatra. The district authorities have extended their assistance because the ‘Asha Yatra’ has been spreading the message of peace and harmony in the country,” Singh added.Led by Sri M, the yatra will reach Kanpur on January 9 and he would address students, senior citizens and social workers of the city in the next three days.“Samajwadi party is leaving no stone unturned to make this yatra a success because its motive is to spread the message of peace and harmony,” local SP leader Mahendra Singh said.Sri M said that the main purpose of this march is to send a message of peace and harmony among people and not to gain any political mileage.A public dialogue programme is being organised on January 10 and Sri M will also address students of Kanpur University on January 11.
