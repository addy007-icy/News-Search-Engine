The order of the G. Sivarajan Commission, which is inquiring into the solar scam, to produce the letter Saritha S. Nair had reportedly written while in jail was stayed by the High Court of Kerala on Monday.The court stayed the order of the commission for two weeks on a petition from Saritha.The letter was reportedly written by Saritha while in Pathanamthitta jail. Lawyers representing a few petitioners in the commission had earlier suggested that the commission should evoke its powers to seize the letter. In her petition, Saritha contended that the letter was a personal communication between her and her lawyer, which a court cannot compel to divulge. The commissionâ€™s directive amounted to violation of her right to privacy, she said.
