The second State-level conference of the Dalitha Hakkula Porata Samithi (DHPS) held here on Tuesday stated that implementing reservation policy in the private sector was the only way to bring Dalits to the mainstream.The conference, which was attended by more than 1,000 people, discussed at length the challenges facing Dalits. Inaugurating the meet, former Vice-Chancellor of Srikrishnadevaraya University Kolakaluri Enoch said even as the United Nations and the Indian Constitution accorded equal rights to all human beings, Dalits were constantly being deprived of their rights.“The plight of Dalit women needs special mention here, as they are a crucial part of the Dalit workforce,” he said, adding that awareness among Dalits about their rights was the need of the hour. “There is also a need for a campaign at the grassroots level, highlighting the rights of Dalit women,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary K. Ramakrishna asked as to why the government had failed to take a decision on extending reservation in jobs to Dalits in the private sector. “Both the Central and State governments are leaving no stone unturned to acquire lands belonging to the poor and Dalits and handing them over to industrial units. That being the case, why can’t they insist that private organisations implement reservation rules in recruitments?” he asked.He said a massive movement would soon be launched demanding reservations in the private sector. Former MLC Jalli Wilson and CPI district unit secretary Tatipaka Madhu also spoke.Both the Central and State governments are leaving no stone unturned to acquire lands belonging to the poor and Dalits.
