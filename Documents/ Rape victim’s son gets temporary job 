There is some hope for 24-year-old Raghu, who was struggling to get a caste certificate to secure a job. Born to a gang-rape victim, who is mentally unsound and speech-and hearing impaired, he had been running from pillar to post to establish which caste he belonged to.MLC Ugrappa, who is also chairperson of the committee for preventing sexual abuse against women and children, has appointed Raghu in his office on a temporary basis in a D Group post. He will now get Rs. 10,500 a month as salary.Raghu had applied for a Scheduled Caste certificate as his mother was begging in a Dalit colony in Mandya district. But, when the local officials did not give the caste certificate, he approached Social Welfare Minister H. Anjaneya, who has now initiated the process to verify facts to grant him the SC certificate. Mr. Ugrappa said Raghu was free to apply for a better post after he gets the SC certificate.
