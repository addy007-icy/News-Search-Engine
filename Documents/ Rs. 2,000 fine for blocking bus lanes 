: Delhites will soon have to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000 for obstructing dedicated lanes for buses. The AAP government announced the rule on Tuesday and said it will be brought into effect within a week.“We have decided to impose a fine of Rs. 2,000 on those who park their cars on dedicated bus lanes or encroach upon it or cause obstructions to the plying of buses. We will not have any problem if cars and other vehicles are plying on bus lanes, but if someone obstructs operation of buses, he or she will be challaned,” Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said at the event organised to dismantle the BRT corridor.With the government aiming at promoting public transport, Sisodia said, “If buses get sufficient space, people will reach their destination on time. People who travel by private vehicles may also then think about travelling in buses.”A senior official said the government will impose the fine on violators under the Motor Vehicle Act by issuing an order similar to the one issued during Commonwealth Games 2010. PWD Minister Satyendar Jain said the government will take strict action against those who park their vehicles on bus lanes.“As per the new rule, you can drive your car or bike in the bus lane, but you cannot stop there. Parking or obstruction of bus lanes will not be allowed. The new rule will be enforced within a week. The government will not tolerate any obstruction on bus lanes. If towing vans pick up any vehicle from bus lane, violators will have to pay Rs. 500-700 for this separately,” Jain said, adding that the problem of traffic was quite big in Delhi and it was the government’s responsibility to solve it.So far, the government has marked bus lanes on 400 kilometres of roads across the Capital. Mr. Sisodia said if the government marks bus lanes on 600-700 km of main roads of the Capital, buses will ply at a high speed.
