The digitisation of the entire collection of the State Central Library, an ambitious project embarked upon in 2006, has ended up as a damp squib.In the past nine years, the library has been able to digitise only 15,000 of its collection of 3.14 lakh books. There’s one thing common to these 15,000 books – all were published before 1950 and the copyright has elapsed.The digitisation of the rest has run into copyright problems. No author or publishing house is giving permission to digitise the content and make them available for free on the internet.Mamatha K.S., Deputy Director, State Central Library, said, “The copyright holders of all major Kannada writers like Kuvempu, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, D. R. Bendre, Shivarama Karanth were approached. All of them have denied permission.”Satish Kumar S. Hosamani, Director, Department of Public Libraries, said, “The copyright issue has almost grounded the project.”Library lacks comprehensive catalogueThe State Central Library may be the only major library with such a huge number of books running without a comprehensive catalogue, making it a Herculean task for readers to explore the collection.Ask for a catalogue and the librarian puts you in front of a large tome of papers — a print out of the complete list of books — which is laborious to explore. It’s not that the library didn’t have a catalogue.Up until 2004, the catalogue was on its old MS-DOS prompt, but was lost during the transition to the e-granthalaya platform of the National Informatics Centre. A new platform has catalogued all books since 2004. The old catalogue is manually being updated to the new platform. The work is yet to be completed.“The work is on every day but we are short of manpower. We hope to complete the process in eight months,” said Mamatha K.S., Deputy Director, State Central Library.
