Apprehending contamination of groundwater, residents of Chennimalaipalayam in Pasuvapatti Panchayat on Monday urged the district administration to direct closure of a coir pith unit in their village.They complained that the unit that was once a rice mill before switching over to coir manufacture was functioning without getting the permission of the panchayat and other licensing authorities.The panchayat located along the Chennimalai-Kangayam Main Road has already been affected due to discharge of untreated effluent by dyeing, bleaching and other polluting industries.The villagers said they feared damage to the groundwater and contamination of water flowing in the LBP canal that irrigates 640 acres in the area, besides 120 wells, 15 borwells of the panchayat and 35 borewells owned by farmers.
