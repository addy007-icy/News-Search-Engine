The news of Akashvani coming out with a classical music station ‘Raagam’ (“ >Akashvanii’s ‘Raagam’ to captivate connoisseurs”, Jan.14) is set to warm the hearts of many music lovers. It will help those who are unable to go to the sabhas or other venues because of their old age or other physical disabilities. Of late, there has been a surge in FM radio stations but they have hardly given the needed space to classical music. In that context, Akashvani’s venture comes at an appropriate time.K.Rajendran,Chennai
