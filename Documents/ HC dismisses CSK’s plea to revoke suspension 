The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition moved by Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited, which owns the Chennai Super Kings IPL franchise team, challenging the suspension of the team from participating in the IPL tournament for two years.The First Bench of Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam pointed out that as mentioned by the Supreme Court, the CSK Chennai Limited cannot be considered an “aggrieved party”. Hence, the petition was not maintainable. The company in its petition alleged that the actual offender Gurunath Meiyappan (former CSK team official) responsible for betting and spot fixing in IPL season six has been “conveniently” let off without even a fine. Instead every single cricketer contracted with the CSK, including thousands of its fans, have been punished by suspending the franchise. The petitioner sought the court to quash the Lodha Committee report on the basis of which the ban was imposed and to direct the BCCI to permit CSK to participate in the IPL matches.CSK Cricket Limited contended that the committee had failed to hear the petitioner before passing the suspension order, though it was informed that ownership of the team had changed from India Cements Limited to the petitioners.CSK Chennai Limited cannotbe consideredan “aggrieved party”
