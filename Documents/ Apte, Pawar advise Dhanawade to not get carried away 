Former India batsman Madhav Apte said cricket is a team game and that even the opponent — Arya Gurukul School — should be appreciated for not running away from the ground, enabling Pranav Dhanawade of KC Gandhi English School score a world record 1,009 not out in an inter -school match at Kalyan recently.After congratulating the 15-year-old Dhanawade, who faced only 327 balls to make the phenomenal individual score, Apte — the chief guest at the Mumbai Cricket Association's felicitation function for him — said: “In as much as I would like to applaud your unthinkable effort, I would also like to appreciate the support given to you by your teammates [Akash Singh and Siddhesh Patil] who batted with you through your innings.”On behalf of the MCA, Apte presented a cheque of Rs.1,20,000 to Dhanawade.The MCA has decided to support Dhanawade for five years. The association also presented cricket bats to Akash Singh (173), Siddhesh Patil (137) and Aayush Kamath (eight for 16, including a hat-trick in the match), and also feliciated Dhanawade’s parents.“Cricket is not always a game of success. But it will reward cricketers who make an effort. You have talent. You have to keep your head on your shoulders; your parents have to play a big role in achieving this. The world will be watching you from now on,” said Apte.Pawar said Dhanawade’s knock was a phenomenal achievement. “It’s exceptional. I will advise you to keep your feet firmly on the ground.”
