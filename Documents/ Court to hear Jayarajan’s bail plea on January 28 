The Principal Sessions Court at Thalassery on Saturday posted for January 28 the hearing on the anticipatory bail application filed by Communist Party of India (Marxist) district secretary P. Jayarajan arraigned as an accused in the case of murder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionary E. Manoj.Mr. Jayarajan had filed the application on January 22 after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) named him an accused in the case under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The court had earlier rejected his two previous anticipatory bail applications when he was not named as an accused in the case. The courtâ€™s earlier rejection was on the ground that the UAPA had been invoked in the case.The beleaguered CPI(M) leader has been hospitalised in the party-controlled AKG Hospital since his earlier anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the court on January 19.The CBI team in its report submitted in the court on naming him as an accused in the case stated that Mr. Jayarajan was the main conspirator behind the crime which it said was executed for him.
