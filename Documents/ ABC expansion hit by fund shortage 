Under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme to mitigate the stray dog menace, the Kollam unit of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) sterilised 1,501 stray dogs in the district last year. Areas coming under three panchayats and Kollam city Corporation were covered by the programme.At a press conference here on Wednesday, SPCA secretary P. Bahuleyan and ABC programme coordinator B. Aravind said that in Kollam city limits alone 1,015 stray dogs were sterilised. Fund paucity was coming in the way of expanding the project. At present the allocation is Rs.1,000 per dog, but the actual expense works out to Rs.1,300 per dog, they said.The project is being carried forward with the help of four men trained in Ooty for trapping stray dogs.Dr. Aravind said that on ABC camp days the four men together trap about 50 to 60 stray dogs. A team of five veterinary surgeons sterilise about 50 dogs a day at a camp, he said.A “v” shaped incision is made on an ear of a sterilised dog to avoid catching it again. The sterilised dogs are released in the same area from where they had been trapped. Dr. Bahuleyan said the second phase of the programme commenced from the Nedumbana panchayat on Tuesday. Under the first phase 206 stray dogs were sterilised here. The target now is to sterilise another 300 dogs.Allocation is Rs.1,000 a dogActual cost comes to Rs.1,300
