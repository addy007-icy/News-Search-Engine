Activists on Sunday alleged that the Buckingham canal was being filled up with mud and sand by the Kamaraj Port Limited. In a post on Facebook, activist Nityanand Jayaraman, shared photos clicked by two other environmentalists from the city, alleging that the Buckingham canal was being filled up in Athipattu near Ennore.He said they visited the area on November 24 and no such activity was going on there at that time. “Parts of the canal have already been severely compromised and with this section at Ennore also being filled, there will be nothing left of it in the coming days,” he alleged. Pooja Kumar, coordinator, Coastal Resource Centre, said the canal was classified as ecologically sensitive under the coastal regulations and that it was unlawful to dump mud and sand on its surface. “In October, we had raised the issue of dumping of material s onto the Ennore creek, which will have a major impact on ecology,” she said.While a response could not be obtained from the management of Kamaraj Port Limited, sources in the Department of Environment said the department will look into the complaints from the residents and environmental activists.
