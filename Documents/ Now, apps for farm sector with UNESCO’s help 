If things go as planned, the farm sector in the State may see many mobile-based apps as UNESCO’s Knowledge Societies Division (KSD) wants to train students and researchers of University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru in technicalities of developing apps on agriculture.“Karnataka is very strong in IT and agriculture. If we can integrate both through mobile phones, which act like pocket computers, it will certainly help farmers,” said Indrajit Banerjee, Director of KSD-UNESCO, who plans to impart this training.Dr. Banerjee told The Hindu, on the sidelines of an international conference on ‘Innovative digital applications for sustainable development’ jointly organised by UAS-B and Global Communication Research Association here, that he was particularly interested in training students as they are mobile savvy.The KSD has sourced the curriculum for mobile app development training from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has also roped in experts for guidance, he said. But, he made it clear that technology alone cannot solve the problems of the agricultural sector as human effort was needed to analyse the complexities of the sector. However, developing a need-based technology would definitely help, he said.Inaugurating the conference, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stressed the need for large-scale application of innovative IT and communication tools in the farming sector for better reach of latest technologies to farmers. Expressing concern over market fluctuations, he called for adopting digital technologies to provide timely information on the market situation to farmers.
