There has been a sudden spurt in vegetable prices though this is the season where one should find vegetables aplenty and at a low price.Tomato is being sold at Rs. 40 per kg while ridge gourd is Rs. 60 per kg; lemon is Rs. 79; carrot Rs. 55; colacassia Rs. 45; beetroot Rs. 40; onion Rs. 30 to Rs. 40; ladies’ finger Rs. 58; potato Rs. 20; green chilli Rs. 62 per kg.Tomato was sold at Rs. 60 per kg two days ago and it had come down a little while the prices of other vegetables are going up with each passing day.P. Radhamma, a resident of Excise Colony, said this was the season when vegetables should be available in good quantity and at cheaper rates. “If vegetables are costing so much now, it is going to be very tough next summer,” she opined.A farmer, N. Venugopal Reddy, said the sudden spurt in prices was due to stoppage of vegetable supplies from Guntur and Krishna districts.Since the trucks transporting them have to pay road tax, they stopped coming to Telangana districts.“The AP government is offering subsidy on transport tax and more farmers are supplying their produce – vegetables and flowers – to Bengaluru,” he pointed out.According to him, four trucks used to come to Hyderabad carrying Okra everyday. Now they stopped.“Naturally, the price of Okra goes up. That is what is happening to other produce as well,” he said.
