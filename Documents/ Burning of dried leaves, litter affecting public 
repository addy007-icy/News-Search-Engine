Fumes emanating from burning of dry leaves and litter, which have become a common sight in many parts of the city, has drawn the ire of pollution control board officials.Even though the burning of waste by the roadside is a violation of the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules 2000, the menace is becoming rampant in the city, point out officials from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).Along with dried leaves and twigs, street swept litter comprising plastic waste is also set on fire. The fume from such fires is feared to be toxic, with the soot and increased level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter known to worsen pulmonary diseases, according to experts.“We have instructed pourakarmikas against the practice, but it has fallen on deaf ears,” an official from the KSPCB told The Hindu urging the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to take punitive measures against the practice. Citing the example of rising pollution levels in Delhi, a KSPCB official said smoke from the bonfire does not disappear in the atmosphere and instead creates smog, contributing to atmospheric pollution.“KSPCB does not have the powers to take action against the violators. It is the MCC which should act against the practice,” the official added.Solid waste management experts had earlier impressed upon the MCC to create compost pits in parks, where dried leaves of the locality could be gathered and allowing it to decompose.MCC officials said the exercise was discontinued after citizens using the park expressed resentment over the practice spoiling the park’s environs.Bonfires of dried leaves and litter affecting public
