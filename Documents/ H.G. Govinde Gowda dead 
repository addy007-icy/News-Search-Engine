Former Minister H.G. Govinde Gowda (90), popularly known as Malenada Gandhi, passed away at his farmhouse near Koppa in Chikkamagaluru district on Wednesday.Mr. Gowda was suffering from respiratory and other age-related problems, and had been undergoing treatment at his house for the last one month.The former Minister was known for the drastic changes that he brought into the teachers’ recruitment process, besides for his honesty and simplicity. Born on May 25, 1926, Mr. Gowda joined the freedom struggle at a young age and actively participated in the Quit India Movement in 1942 and Mysore Chalo Movement in 1948. He was elected president of the Koppa Municipal Council in 1952 and was active in politics till 1999. During his tenure as the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education (1995-99), he removed the district-level recruitment committees, which were constituted to recruit teachers through interviews. In an interaction with The Hindu a few months ago, he recalled how he had faced tough opposition for his decision. “I was not happy with the process of recruitment through interviews. One can hardly avoid bias or prejudice there. Caste, cash or familiarity or any other factor may work in an interview. I introduced common entrance tests for recruitment,” he had said. Throughout his career, Mr. Gowda never faced an allegation of corruption. In fact, his rivals too admired his simplicity and unblemished career. He had told this correspondent that he decided to quit politics because he was getting uncomfortable with the changes. Mr. Gowda leaves behind his wife Shantha, a son and five daughters. The final rites will be held at his farm on Thursday.CondolencesChief Minister Siddaramaiah and several leaders of the BJP have mourned Mr. Gowda.
