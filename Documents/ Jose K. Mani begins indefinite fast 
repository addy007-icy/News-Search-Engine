Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani, MP, on Monday launched an indefinite fast demanding immediate intervention of the Central government to find a lasting solution to the crisis in the natural rubber sector.Inaugurating the fast, party working chairman and Minister for Water Resources P.J. Joseph said the low import tariff for natural rubber had resulted in unrestrained imports by the consuming industry, which had created a problem of plenty in the internal market.“The core reason for the unprecedented price fall of natural rubber is the low import tariff and it has to be hiked immediately,” he said.While natural rubber attracts an import tariff of 25 per cent, the government had the right to increase it to 70 per cent if natural rubber was included among the list for goods attracting protective tariff, under various international trade treaties entered into by the country, Mr. Joseph said.In his address, party chairman K.M. Mani came down heavily on the Central government, which, in spite of repeated demands made by the State, had not taken any effective steps to bring the price line back to normal. The State government had taken up the issue with the Union government earlier and later asked for releasing Rs.500 crore from the price stabilisation fund. “Though they had agreed to the plea, nothing has been done so far,’’ he said.Party deputy chairman C.F. Thomas presided.
