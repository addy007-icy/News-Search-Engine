: The Delhi Police may boast of cracking the toughest of crimes in quick time, but when it comes to thefts of any kind, they lose their steam.If their own statistics are anything to go by, there is a very little chance of being reunited with your vehicles or belongings once it has been stolen in Delhi.The police have been able to recover only four per cent of the 31,114 motor vehicles stolen from the Capital in 2015. At 12.28 per cent, they were only marginally better in solving other thefts.The failure reflected in Delhi Police Commissioner’s speech on Monday as he used the annual press conference to appeal to the public to not rely entirely on the police to solve such cases.“Police are unable to detect most cases of thefts. So, people should go for electronic surveillance and opt for insurance if they can afford it,” was his suggestion.These theft cases have also seen a significant increase when compared to 2014. Mr. Bassi partially attributed the increase to the force’s determination to truthfully register FIRs in all complaints.“In one incident, we registered and investigated a case pertaining to loss of three goats. On another occasion, we registered a FIR when someone lost Rs. 20. Nobody’s loss is small and our priority is to not turn away any complainant from a police station,” said Mr. Bassi.Subsequently, crime in the Capital saw a 24 per cent surge last year as compared to the year before that.However, some heinous crimes such as dacoity, murders and abduction saw a marginal decrease.So, while the overall solving of the cases went down from 29.5 per cent in 2014 to 27.32 per cent in 2015, most of the failures were in cases involving thefts.Police claimed an increase in cracking crimes such as robberies, rapes, molestation, extortion, and abductions. They also went on to arrest 62,017 suspects in 2015, a 12 per cent increase when compared to the year before that.Police have been able to recover only 4% of the 31,114 cars stolen in 2015
