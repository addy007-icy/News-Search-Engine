The students of Ravenshaw University, owing allegiance to the All-India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO), staged a dharna in front of the office of the Vice-Chancellor here on Monday demanding withdrawal of the choice-based credit system (CBCS) introduced for the post-graduate students last year.The CBCS was introduced mid-session last year in which each PG student was asked to chose another non-traditional subject, evaluation of which is made based on the students’ attendance and term paper content. “The evaluation of CBCS based on attendance and term paper are not the proper methods to assess the aptitude of a student and the system would actually set in preferential treatment to some,” said AIDSO leader and varsity students’ union vice-president Pratyuptna Naik.The University authorities however expressed surprise over such a demand. “The CBCS should have been welcomed by the students,” said Vice-Chancellor Dr P. C. Sarangi.The authorities, nevertheless, have forwarded the memorandum of the demand to the Chancellor and to UGC authorities, sources said.
