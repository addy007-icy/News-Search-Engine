The Chennai-Kanyakumari Express was delayed on Monday evening at Tambaram after a wordy duel broke out between Railway officials and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel.Sources said the problem started when the RPF personnel attached to the station detained a few passengers travelling in a compartment reserved for the physically challenged.During the checking process, the RPF men had found Railway staffers travelling in an unreserved compartment by locking the doors.The staffers, who were detained, then staged a dharna protesting the RPF action in front of the Government Railway Police Station on Platform 1. They dispersed after the intervention of Railway Police personnel and on-duty staffers at the station.The train left Tambaram after a 30-minute delay, according to Railway officials at Tambaram.
