The Union government initiative to train girl students of government schools in karate has come under the scanner for its shoddy implementation.Prema Biradar, a Class VIII student of government high school here, who has been undergoing training in karate at her school, says that the scheme had not been implemented properly.It has been launched under the Rashtriya Madhaymika Shiksha Abhiyan. Each school has been asked to give 18 hours of training in karate to students in an academic year by appointing certified instructors.Teachers and the instructors believe that mere 18 hours of training is inadequate to equip students with self-defence techniques.“To learn some basic techniques and practice them, one should need at least six months of training. It is difficult to teach good self-defence techniques in 18 hours. Else, the very objective of preparing the girls to tackle any eventuality will get defeated,” Bhagyamma Nirvanashetty, one of the instructors, said.She said that the instructors had to teach over 200 students in a batch and it was difficult to monitor each student.“Another major problem is that many headmasters do not cooperate with us. They think self-defence is not so important. They do not allow us to train students saying that they have a lot to cover under the syllabus and can’t spare an hour for karate,” Ms. Nirvanashetty said.
