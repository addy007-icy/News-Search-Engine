In a political embarrassment to the Shiv Sena, which has been championing the cause of drought-affected farmers, Shiv Sena MP from Aurangabad Chandrakant Khaire has come under fire from the Opposition for hosting a lavish wedding for his daughter Prerna in Aurangabad on Monday at a time Marathawada region has witnessed suicides by more than 800 farmers.Mr Khaire’s youngest daughter Prerna Khaire got married to Basavraj Haralpatti, a consultant with Tata Consultancy Services from Dharwad, in Aurangabad on Monday evening at a lavishly hosted wedding pandal designed like a palace. Reports said over 5000 people were invited for a dinner at the sangeet hosted at Guru Lawns, a prominent open air wedding venue in Aurangabad. Over 40 rooms were booked at the Ajanta Ambassador hotel and three star hotels in the city.The wedding, which reportedly cost Rs 50 lakh, has come in for sharp criticism from the Opposition. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “It appears Uddhavji Thackeray’s effort to raise money for drought-affected by selling his photographs at a charity event has gone waste considering the kind of money Shiv Sena leaders seem to have. We have been saying that instead of looking for government land for Balasaheb Thackeray memorial, it should turn to Sena leaders who seem to have enough money as is visible.”NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik criticised Khaire for lack of sensitivity and hosting a lavish wedding when the region is facing its worst drought. “It is not correct to host such lavish weddings at a time people of Marathawada are facing severe hardships and a spate of farmer suicides have been reported. In the past, our party chief Sharad Pawar had publicly criticised an NCP leader who hosted a lavish wedding a few years ago, and he was almost removed as a cabinet minister.”
