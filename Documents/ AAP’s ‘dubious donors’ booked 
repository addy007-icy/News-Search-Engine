The Delhi Police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has booked the four ‘dubious donor’ companies — which had donated Rs. 2 crore to Aam Aadmi Party before the last general elections — for forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy.The FIR has been registered on the basis of a complaint by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which had conducted a probe against these companies following the claims of a splinter group, AAP Volunteer Action Manch (AVAM), said a senior police officer.Just before last year’s Assembly elections, the allegations were made by AVAM members and rejected by the AAP.However, later in 2015, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs had conducted an independent inquiry into the functioning of the companies during which they had found some of the registered addresses to be incorrect.“In addition, the signature of a chartered accountant shown in the books of accounts was found to be forged,” said the officer.
