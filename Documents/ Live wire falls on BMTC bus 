The driver stopped the bus, climbed on top and pulled down the wire with a wooden plank.Waseem Menon, a software engineer who witnessed the incident, said the snapped part of the wire was dangling to the ground and did not touch the bus. Sparks were emanating, creating panic among the passers-by, he said.The matter was brought to the police who rushed to the spot and alerted the BESCOM officials to take repair work immediately. The police are investigating to ascertain whether there was any lapse on part of the house owner who had taken connection.
