Kalpana, the talented actress who died earlier in the day, was remembered at the closing ceremony with a minute of silence.Actor Nivin Pauly, the chief guest, said he was in a very sad state of mind; Kalpana had played his mother in Bangalore Days.With the fight for the Gold Cup becoming close, there was a spurt in ‘appeals’ on the final day.With only an hour to go for the closing ceremony, the appeal committee had over 50 appeals pending. In the end though, the appeals did not make much of a difference in the overnight lead positions.There was no big rush on Monday at the police training ground, where the Oottupura was set up, with most of the competitions over. The volunteers therefore had an easier time.The judging was a talking point on the last day too, A teacher alleged that there was only one judge who was an expert in the Kuttanad style.Another expert said some judges were not well studied.Actor Jagannatha Varma was the cynosure of all eyes at the VJT Hall when the Chenda Thayambaka competition was on. An accomplished Kathakali artiste, the septuagenarian is an enthusiast of the Chendamelam.(Compiled byR.K. Roshni,Sarath Babu George,S.R. Praveen andP.K. Ajith Kumar)
