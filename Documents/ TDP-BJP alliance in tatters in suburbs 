The Telugu Desam- Bharatiya Janata Party alliance is in tatters, at least in the Ranga Reddy areas of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) with elections just a few days away.Party activists of the district unit are totally distraught and disillusioned with the manner in which the wards allocation was decided.Openly accusing the “Hyderabad city leaders” of “selling tickets to outsiders”, long-standing party activists and leaders have besieged the party office here for the last couple of days trying in vain to convince the seniors to see reason.“We have been sacrificed to protect the interests of the leaders in the capital so that they could get wards of their choice. Our cadre is totally upset, there is no alliance in this part of the capital area,” say senior leaders, not wishing to be identified.Top leaders of both the parties have agreed to give 19 of the 63 wards in the district.While clearly unhappy about the “less number” of seats allocated, BJP leaders claim that most strongholds were bartered away much against the opinion of the local leaders.To add insult to injury, they say that in several divisions allocated to the party, the Telugu Desam partymen filed nominations going against the spirit in which the agreement was reached.While no divisions were given to the BJP in Rajenderanagar, of the 10 divisions in Madhapur-Serilingampally one was given, but here too the TDP had issued ‘B’ forms, it is alleged.Similarly, in Qutbullapur, of the eight divisions, just one was allocated and here too TDP had issued ‘B’ form as is the case in Maheswaram. In Uppal, of the seven seats, TDP candidates filed nominations in seven, senior party leaders point out.“The mistake our party leaders made during the last general elections when they tied up with the Telugu Desam is being repeated once again. We are losing ground because of the alliance,” party leaders feel.
