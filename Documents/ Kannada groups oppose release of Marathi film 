“Maratha Tiger”, a Marathi feature film allegedly depicting the protracted boundary dispute between Karnataka and Maharashtra, has sparked off peaceful protests among Kannada organisations which are opposing release of the film in boundary areas of Karnataka, even as the Additional Deputy Commissioner, Suresh Itnal, on Friday issued directions to the police authorities to take all precautionary measures against possible untoward incidents due to release of the film in the district.The ADC has directed the City Police Commissioner, Superintendent of Police and Sub-Divisional Magistrates of Belagavi and Chikkodi to take measures that the film did not spark any untoward incidents in their respective jurisdictions.Both the ADC and Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee President Ashok Chandargi said the trailer clearly depicted “Yellur incidents” (in Belagavi taluk) of July 25, 2014, which was presently before the National Human Rights Commission following a complaint from a Maharashtra-based politician Vinod Tavade. The film also suggested that no reply was submitted to the NHRC notice.Mr.Chandargi said since the Yellur incident was still before the NHRC and the boundary dispute was yet to be disposed of by the Supreme Court, the film should not be screened in the boundary areas of Karnataka.
