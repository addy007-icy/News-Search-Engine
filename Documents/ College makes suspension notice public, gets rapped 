The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has raised objections to a Delhi University college making public a notice about a girl’s suspension over allegations of stealing a phone.Dyal Singh College recently made public a circular about suspension of a student who allegedly stole a phone from the college. The notice was put up on the notice board and website.The notice read: “The student has been suspended from college for her involvement in case of theft of a mobile phone on recommendation of discipline committee of the college.”Despite a section of college teachers and DCW members raising objections over this, principal I.S. Bakshi said: “It is not just an allegation. The girl confessed to the act toohence there should be no objection to making public the student’s name. Other students will also refrain from indulging in such activities in the future.”The girl has also been asked to give an explanation about why she should not be rusticated.Terming the act as “unbecoming of the college”, DCW chief Swati Maliwal said the college should not have made a circular like that public.“Even if the girl is guilty, she should not be subjected to such public harassment for theft of a cell phone. The college can punish her, but announcing it on its website is unethical,” said Ms. Maliwal.
