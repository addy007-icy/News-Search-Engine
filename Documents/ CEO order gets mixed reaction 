The order of the Chief Executive Officer of Belagavi Zilla Panchayat to officials and staff at the ZP, taluk and gram panchayats to attend duty even on Republic Day had a mixed impact on Tuesday.Bagadi Gautham, two days ago, issued orders that panchayat offices would have to work on on Tuesday.The reported reason behind his order was that a holiday would affect relief works in the drought-affected district.Unemployed villagers were looking for opportunities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme daily.Therefore, panchayat officials had been asked to work as usual after the flag-hoisting ceremony. However, though attendance was normal at the ZP offices in the city, empty chairs greeted visitors after lunch.Even at 3.45 p.m., but for one staff member, all the open cubicles in the Accounts department were empty.Similarly, there was only one staff member and a peon in the Administrative section housed in the ground floor.Mr.Gautham has shown genuine concern towards the plight of the villagers reeling under drought conditions in varying degrees.It remains to be seen if his staff would work even on Sundays and other holidays in the days to come given that scarcity of water and impact of drought was bound to be more severe with the onset of summer and till sufficient monsoon.
