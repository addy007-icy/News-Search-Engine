: The United Democratic Front convener P.P. Thankachan on Saturday accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) of enrolling bogus voters on a large scale fearing defeat in the coming Assembly elections.In a statement here, Mr. Thankachan said the LDF leadership had made fun of him when he made a statement a couple of weeks ago about the discrepancy in the number of voters enlisted. He alleged that the bogus voters were enrolled with the help of booth level officers who were appointed during the term of V.S. Achuthanandan as Chief Minister. This was done in the context of the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha election defeats. He wanted the Chief election Commission and the Chief Electoral Officer of the State to examine this matter and order a comprehensive probe, if necessary.
