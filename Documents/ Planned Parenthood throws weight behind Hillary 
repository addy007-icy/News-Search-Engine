The endorsement by the group’s political arm marks Planned Parenthood’s first time wading into a presidential primary, and it comes as former U.S. Secretary of state Hillary Clinton remains locked in a tight contest with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire, home of the first two nominating contests. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley trails both rivals in the race.“Based on her record and extraordinary support that she’s given to our issues, people felt very strongly that she’s the candidate,” the group’s president, Cecile Richards, said Sunday. “There is nothing about this endorsement that should reflect badly on Senator Sanders or Governor O’Malley.”Planned Parenthood is a large provider of abortion and reproductive health services and has become a lightning rod in the 2016 campaign. Most Republican presidential candidates object to continued federal financing of the organization and a measure has passed the Republican-led House to stop the flow of money.Ms. Richards said the group is making an early endorsement so that it can begin reminding voters about the Republican candidates’ “extreme” positions on abortion rights and women’s health. The group plans to spend at least $20 million in the 2016 campaign.“I don’t know that it has been particularly clear in the Republican primary just exactly how extreme these candidates are.”In contrast, she said, Ms. Clinton has long fought for women’s rights and to protect women’s access to birth control, safe and legal abortion and other reproductive health services.
