Delhi Culture Minister Kapil Mishra on Friday encouraged writers to write freely on contemporary issues without fear.“People who can unite society with their writings and those who can understand why stones started arriving in January 2016 in Ayodhya, should…write freely about such issues in order to discourage divisive elements in society,” he said while inaugurating the fourth edition of the Delhi Literature Festival here.He was referring to the arrival of stones in Ayodhya.On being asked by The Hindu as to how literature can help in generating awareness on new initiatives such as the odd-even scheme, Mr. Mishra noted that “literary writings as well as poems can be used to raise awareness on environmental issues.”(The writer is an intern with The Hindu)
