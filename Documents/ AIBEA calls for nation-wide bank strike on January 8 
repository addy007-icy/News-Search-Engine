All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) has called for a one-day nation-wide strike on January 8 to protest against the “unfair” policies adopted by SBI with respect to its five associate banks.The country’s largest lender has five subsidiaries - State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Hyderabad and State Bank of Patiala.“The agitation is because of the continued unfair labour practises of the SBI management who are trying to force SBI service conditions on the associate banks,” AIBEA said in a statement.The union is against imposition of SBI’s service conditions and career progression rules in associate banks.They have also demanded delinking the associate banks from SBI.AIBEA had earlier planned for a similar strike in associate banks on December 1 and 2.However, the strike was deferred subsequent to a conciliation meeting on November 23, 2015, wherein SBI management agreed to defer the implementation of the career progression scheme and hold bilateral discussions with the unions.“The bilateral meeting that was subsequently held with the union was futile and the management continued with their adamant stand on the issues. Hence, we are going on with the strike,” it added.
