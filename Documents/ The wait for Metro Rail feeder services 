It is six months since Chennai Metro Rail launched its first service, but commuters are still left without any feeder services, such as mini-buses, to help them get to the nearest Metro Rail station.According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they have held several discussions with authorities of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) over the past few months. “We are ready even now. We are hoping they will start the feeder services in the next 3-4 months,” an official said.Meanwhile, CMRL has also expressed its interest in running battery-operated three-and four-wheelers based on a public-private partnership model. But it is not clear when this proposal will take off.At first, CMRL wants to run mini-buses on the main feeder routes that have already been finalised on the Koyambedu-Alandur stretch. When the ridership increases, share autos will be plying on the narrower roads and streets.“But, this may take some time,” an official added.But, sources at MTC said it might take a while before they started any services here. “We have not taken a call on when to run the mini-bus service in areas near the Koyambedu-Alandur stretch,” an official said.It is of prime importance to bring in feeder services on this stretch at the earliest. Right now, commuters in the neighbouring areas of Metro Rail stations wanting to take the facility either have to walk or use private transport.
