Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday gave his nod to setting up ‘Marketing and Agri Business’ department under the Punjab Mandi Board for providing necessary back-up support to the farmers of the State to ensure marketing of their produce.“Badal has felt that though the hard working and resilient farmers of the state have consistently enhanced the production of food grains, vegetables and fruits, honey and others but there was a complete lack of proper marketing mechanism for their produce.“Therefore, he had asked the Additional Chief Secretary (Development) to immediately constitute ‘Marketing and Agri Business’ department under the Punjab Mandi Board for providing necessary support to the farmers of the state to ensure marketing of their produce,” a spokesman of the Chief Minister’s Office said.
