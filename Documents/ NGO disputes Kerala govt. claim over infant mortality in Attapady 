Hardly a week after Kerala Minister for Panchayats and Social Welfare M.K. Muneer claimed that only 14 infant deaths were reported from Attappady in 2015, a non-governmental organisation has come out with statistics proving there were 24 such cases during the period.The Centre for Tribal Education, Development and Research (Thambu) has prepared a detailed list of infant deaths, miscarriages, and neonatal deaths which occurred in 2015 and dispatched it to the Chief Minister, Health Minister, and the Scheduled Tribes Welfare Minister.Talking to The Hindu here on Wednesday, Thambu convener K.A. Ramu said the agency had documentary evidence to prove that 26 cases of miscarriages and neonatal deaths were reported from Attappady last year. According to him, three infant deaths occurred at Government Medical College in Thrissur while another occurred at Palakkad District Hospital.Seven such cases were reported from Government Tribal Specialty Hospital at Attappady and five deaths reported from Medical College Hospital, Coimbatore.An infant died while undergoing treatment at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences & Technology in Thiruvananthapuram and one such case was reported from a private hospital at Attappady. Six infants died at tribal settlements in Attappady, he said.According to Mr. Ramu, there was a concerted effort to claim that tribal health in Attappady had improved considerably following effective government intervention since 2013 when 47 infant deaths were reported.Thambu president Rajendra Prasad demanded a peopleâ€™s audit of ongoing government-sponsored welfare schemes in Attappady.
