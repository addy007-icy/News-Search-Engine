With the Centre releasing the much-awaited financial assistance to tackle drought in Karnataka, Revenue Minister V. Srinivas Prasad said farmers who suffered crop loss would receive compensation by January 25.Mr. Prasad told presspersons here on Tuesday that the Centre had released Rs. 1,540.2 crore against the Rs. 2,278.17 crore sought by the State. The compensation would be credited directly into the bank accounts of farmers. Tahsildars and deputy directors of agriculture had been instructed to identify beneficiaries without bank accounts and facilitate opening their accounts in nationalised banks, he said.While farmers would be compensated for 68 per cent of the crop loss suffered, the other drought relief activities, including providing drinking water and fodder, would also receive a further push, he said.The Central aid released for drought in the State was the highest ever, claimed Mr. Prasad and recalled that the previous highest was Rs. 1,400 crore released in 2009 during the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhâ€™s tenure.In addition to the Rs. 1,540.2 crore, the State government had released Rs. 300 crore. Hence, the total drought relief works in the State would amount to Rs. 1,850 crore, he said, and added that officials had been instructed to spare no efforts in the relief activities.Additional fundsWith the failure of the northeast monsoon creating drought conditions in 12 districts of northern Karnataka, the State government is planning to submit a fresh memorandum seeking an additional Rs. 700 crore from the Centre. Mr. Prasad said he had also sought Rs. 700 crore from the State government to tackle drought.
