Aam Aadmi Party, Karnataka, has urged the Union government to withdraw Rule 8 of the Central Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Rules, 2007, which mandates only those with a minimum qualification of eighth pass to get driving licence for all transport vehicles.Demanding withdrawal of rule, AAP is holding a rally on Sunday jointly with auto and taxi drivers unions on Sunday (January 31) at St. Joseph’s Indian High School Grounds, here.AAP president and Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, who is in Bengaluru for medical treatment, will address the rally.At a press conference here on Thursday, AAP convenor Siddharth Sharma said that ‘8th standard pass rule’ has not been repealed in the draft notification, instead some exceptions have been made.“These exceptions will not help drivers instead it will lead to more confusion and harassment of a large section of citizens who are seeking self-employment. Most of the drivers are from economically weaker section and many of them are not educated. After testing their driving skill, they should be given licence,” he said.
