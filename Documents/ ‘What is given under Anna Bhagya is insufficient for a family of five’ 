Along with appreciation, there were suggestions from the beneficiaries of various bhagya schemes of the State government under implementation, for bringing in improvements so as to achieve the desired results.This was witnessed when Shivaraj Tangadagi, Minister of State for Minor Irrigation and district in-charge, interacted directly with beneficiaries to elicit their opinion about the programmes at the Jana mana programme, organised by the Department of Information, in association with the district administration, here on Monday.Shameed Bi of Gangavati underlined the need for enhancing the quantum of rice being distributed under Anna Bhagya stating that what is being given was insufficient for a family of five. This was endorsed by other beneficiaries.“People who are starving understand the importance of Anna Bhagya and those who are not aware of hunger have been criticising it,” was the opinion of Bheemappa of Karamadi in Yelburga taluk.When the beneficiaries of Krishi Bhagya sought an increase in the size of the pond to be constructed in their fields, Mr. Tangadagi intervened to say that he would get check-dams constructed on nalahs and sought the cooperation of farmers. He appealed to them to store water during the rainy season not only as part of conservation but also to help recharge the water-table. On complaints that some banks were not responding properly to lending needs, Mr. Tangadagi instructed the Lead District Manager to look into the matter and sort out the issues.Schoolchildren requested the Minister to provide them milk for six days under the Ksheera Bhagya, while hostel inmates thanked the government for introducing Vidyasiri that enabled them to pursue their education.Summing up the programme, Mr. Tangadagi said that the purpose of introducing welfare schemes would be successful only when the last man in society is also benefited by it and exhorted the officials concerned to strive to implement the schemes sincerely.Amaresh Kulagi, Zilla Panchayat president, M. Kanagavalli, Deputy Commissioner, R. Ramachandran, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer, Tyagarajan, Superintendent of Police, were, among others, present.
