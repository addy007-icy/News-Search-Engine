After a year-long wait, the Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) the Centre has finally granted the one-time financial assistance of Rs. 540 crore for constructing underground drainage system (UGD).The project, which is part of the Essential Urban Infrastructure Scheme of the Union Ministry of Urban Development, was sanctioned last year.Incidentally, the UGD project got delayed owing to the failure of the State government to finalise the executing agency. Though the government has entrusted the work to the Health Department, the GMC is keen on monitoring it.The UGD project is unique in the sense that a one-time financial grant of Rs. 540 crore has been sanctioned for it.The existing UGD system in the town was set up way back in 1959 and has been covering just 22 per cent of the municipal area.The installed capacity of the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Suddapalli Donka is 12 million litres a day (MLD).
