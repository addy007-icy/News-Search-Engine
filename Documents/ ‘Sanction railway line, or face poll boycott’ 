Around 5,000 members of the Citizen's Committee that has been campaigning for the revival of the Erode-Dharapuram- Palani new railway line via Dharapuram and Kangayam in the district, plans to boycott the Assembly elections.“We will boycott the elections if the project gets a raw deal yet again in this year's Union Railway Budget. Though the project was conceptualised many decades back, a mere Rs. 2 crore was sanctioned in the Railway Budget of 2005. A total of Rs. 82 crore been sanctioned in the last 11 years against the then estimate of Rs 600 crore,” said N. Kulanthaisamy, president of the committee.Even surveys were not carried out, or works on land acquisition has begun. If the project gets delayed further, the expenditure will shoot up.
