The Madras High Court has refused to grant any interim injunction against conducting Celebrity Cricket League (CCL) 2016 â€” a T20 league format, in which over 60 film artists from four different languages participate .Two South Indian private television houses sought relief against Celebrity Cricket League Limited, a Hyderabad-based company, which organises CCL.The issue pertains to pending arbitration proceedings moved by Vijay Television Pvt. Ltd. and Asianet Communications Pvt. Ltd against the cricket company to recover dues to be paid by CCL.Both the media houses approached the High Court seeking an interim relief contending that the company should not be allowed to conduct CCL 2016 or any similar event till their dues are fully paid.Refusing to grant any interim relief, Justice S. Manikumar directed Karbonn Mobiles India Private Limited, a Delhi-based company which is the garnishee in all the applications, to deposit Rs. 67.10 lakh as fixed deposit to the credit of the media houses one week before the final match of CCL 2016 scheduled for February 13.The judge then appointed retired Judge of Madras High Court, Justice K. Mohan Ram, as arbitrator.
