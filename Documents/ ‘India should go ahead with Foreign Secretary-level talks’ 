The former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda has suggested that India should go ahead with the Foreign Secretary level talks with Pakistan scheduled for next week and should not suspend it in view of the terror attack on the airbase at Pathankot in Punjab. He was talking to presspersons in Yadgir on Tuesday.Mr. Gowda, who backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi after his recent visit to Pakistan to wish Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff on his birth day, said that the international community had appreciated Mr. Modiâ€™s move. But, he said that the Army should be kept ready to face any eventualities because the Pakistan Army had declared a war against India even after the Agra summit. To a question, he said that he did not think that the Pathankot incident had happened because of intelligence failure. Home Minister Rajnath Singh had already alerted the States several times about possible terror attacks.
