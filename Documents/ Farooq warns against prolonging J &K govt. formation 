National Conference (NC) president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Monday warned the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the BJP against prolonging government formation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying “indecision is against the larger interest of the people and the State.”Speaking in Jammu, Mr. Abdullah asked the coalition partners to “either form the government to end political uncertainty or pave way for dissolution of the Legislative Assembly.”“The people have mandated the two parties to govern the State and they cannot shirk their responsibilities,” Mr. Abdullah said.He said the “sensitive” State could not afford political stalemate for a long period.“There is no option but to go to the people,” he said.
