New pre-primary centres can no longer operate from places such as garages without adequate ventilation and without putting in place safety measures. The highly unregulated pre-primary education sector has finally come on the radar of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, which, on Monday, issued a notification specifying the norms and guidelines for opening new centres.As per the criteria listed, a new pre-primary centre has to have one square metre space for every child. It has to employ a minimum of two staff members, and at least one of them has to be a woman. Other requirements include proper bathroom facilities, safe drinking water, and a first-aid kit.In 2014, the government issued norms and criteria for opening new schools, but at that time, it was not clear if these criteria applied to pre-schools too. “There was lack of clarity on whether we should treat pre-primary sections on a par with schools. Therefore we were not able to monitor them or insist that they have any requirements,” said a Block Education Officer here.Pruthvi Banwasi, secretary, Karnataka Council for Preschools, which has 500 members across the State, said the government had finally acknowledged pre-schools as an independent segment and that the measure would help eliminate misconduct by lower-rung officers in the department.No check on qualityHowever,parents and parents’ associations point out that the notification was a half-hearted attempt at regulating pre-schools. For instance, the government has not addressed key points pertaining to the qualification of teachers and the student-teacher ratio, they said.Charmaine D’Souza, a parent whose daughter goes to a pre-school in north Bengaluru, said, “Many pre-schools neither have experienced teachers nor a clear methodology on the curriculum. It would have helped if the norms mandated these.” There was no well-defined rule on age criteria for students, she added.Pre-primary centres can start at any time of the yearThe notification also allows new pre-primary centres to open any time through the academic year after submitting a proposal three months prior to their commencement. This has received criticism from parents.Sujatha S., who lives in Kamakshipalya, said, “Many of the pre-primary centres open and close as they wish. This causes lot of hardships to parents as they have to scout for places as such centres operate according to the whims and fancies of the owners.”Pre-primary centres having primary classes, however, will have to apply for permission to open new schools based on the calendar of events prescribed by the department.Every new pre-primary school should haveOne square metre space for each childOne classroom for 30 studentsSafety and security facilitiesA minimum three years’ rental agreementSafe drinking water and toiletsAdequate ventilation and lightA first-aid kit and staff trained to use itA minimum of two staff members, including a womanEligibilityThese institutions have to be registered under the Societies Registration Act or the Companies Act or as a trustPre-primary registration needs no certificateRegistration fees to be paid to the Department of Public InstructionIn rural areas | Rs. 2,000In cities other than Bengaluru | Rs. 5,000In Bengaluru | Rs. 10,000For the 2016–17 academic year, managements need to submit proposals online by February-end
