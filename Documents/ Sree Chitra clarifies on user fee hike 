Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, which has been in the eye of a storm following its decision to increase user charges for its hospital and clinical services, has clarified that the hike is necessary for the institute to continue providing the subsidised care it has been offering to over 60 per cent of its patients till now.In a statement on Friday, Director of SCTIMST Asha Kishore said the institute has been offering services to patients in five categories, out of which, only 34 to 39 per cent of patients, belonging to Category D, who pay in full, would be affected by the user fee hike. Category A patients, who enjoy 100 per cent subsidy, constitute about 4-9 per cent of the total patients. Category B1 receives 60 per cent subsidy (23-29.5 per cent of patients). Category B patients receive a 30 per cent subsidy (21.7-27 per cent) while Category C, who get a 10 per cent subsidy, constitutes 5.8-9 per cent of patients. These subsidies will continue, which means that about 60 per cent of the patients would receive subsidised care.Dr. Kishore said that the SCT had to find over Rs.20 crore annually for subsidies, for which it does not receive any special grants from the Centre. Over the years, this had resulted in a huge strain on the instituteâ€™s finances.Only 34-39% patients, who pay in full, will be affected, claims institute Director
