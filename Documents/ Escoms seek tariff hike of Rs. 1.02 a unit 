Brace yourselves for a shocker: the five electricity supply companies (Escoms) in the State have sought a hike of Rs. 1.02 a unit across all categories for the upcoming revision of electricity tariff. In their petitions seeking revision in tariff to Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), the power utilities have sought a uniform hike for the financial year 2016–17 citing a deficit in revenue.The hike sought this time by far exceeds the tariff revision proposals in recent years by the Escoms. Last year, they had asked for a hike of 80 paise a unit, but the KERC allowed the tariff to be hiked by 13 paise a unit. Prior to that, the tariff was hiked by 32 paise a unit in May 2014. This was the seventh hike in five-and-a-half years since November 2009.While Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company has published its tariff revision proposal, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company is also expected to do the same soon. KERC chairman M.K. Shankarlinge Gowda said public hearings would be held in February.However, the proposed hike is already facing stiff opposition. Bangalore Chambers of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) has expressed concern over the margin of the hike sought, as previously the Escoms had asked for hikes ranging from 66 paise to 88 paise.Anuj Sharma, president of the BCIC, was quoted as saying, “The industry is already facing severe hardships owing to unscheduled power cuts, poor frequency, and staggered holidays… and is struggling to manage its production and growth. The proposed hike of more than Rs. 1 a unit will only further aggravate the situation and shall erode margins of the industry which is already facing multiple challenges.”However, the power utilities said they had rarely been granted the hike they proposed. A senior Bescom official also said if the KERC agreed to its new proposals, among which is a hike in fixed charges, such a steep hike would not be needed.
