At a small dwelling tucked away in one of the bylanes behind a playground at Momim Colony, off Mysuru Road in Bengaluru, there was a bang on the door at about 4 a.m. on Friday. A team of around 20 National Investigation Agency (NIA) personnel barged in as the door opened.Sohail Ahmed, a madrasa teacher whom they had come searching for, was asleep and before he could know what was happening, he was whisked away by the sleuths, the family recounted later. The NIA team left with Sohail within a matter of a few minutes.Sohail Ahmed was among the six youths picked up by the NIA in pre-dawn operations in Bengaluru, Mangaluru and Tumakuru for alleged IS links.The simultaneous raids started around 3 a.m. While operations in Mangaluru and Tumakuru were carried out with the help of local police, the operations in Bengaluru did not involve any local police help, sources in Bengaluru police confirmed.The NIA sleuths did not inform the families of those detained or arrested of the charges against them or served any arrest memo. The families with whom The Hindu spoke to said the sleuths neither identified themselves nor did they reveal that they were from the NIA.The operations concluded by around 11 a.m. The six youths have been kept at an undisclosed place for questioning. Two of them, Mohammed Afzal from Bengaluru, and Najmul Huda from Mangaluru, who have been arrested, are expected to be taken to New Delhi by Saturday morning.NIA teams didn’t face any resistanceBengaluru/Mangaluru/Tumakuru: Though the NIA personnel were prepared to face any eventuality of resistance, they did not face any in the State, sources said.While the Kochi NIA team that picked up Najmul Huda in Mangaluru had come armed with a dossier of his Internet footprints, the team that arrested Mohammed Afzal in Bengaluru, was anticipating resistance and had come armed.Afzal’s wife alleged that her husband was handcuffed and the NIA team searched for weapons in the house, but to no avail.The NIA operation in Tumakuru could have turned tense as residents of the locality started gathering on the streets. The sleuths asked them to get inside their houses and latched around 40 houses from outside, as they continued with their operation.
