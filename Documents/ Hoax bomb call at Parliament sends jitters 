A phone call about a bomb being planted in a car parked in Parliament premises threw the Delhi Police into a tizzy on Tuesday evening. No explosives were recovered after the over two-hour-long search operation, leading to the police terming it a hoax call.Within hours of the call, the police traced and detained a 40-year-old man for making the call. He has been identified as Rakesh, a native of Jyoti Nagar in North-East Delhi.The police received the call around 7.15 p.m., upon which one team was tasked with identifying the caller, while some others were dispatched to conduct a thorough search.Messages were flashed in the New Delhi district and members of bomb detection and disposal squads were ordered to reach Parliament at the earliest. Fire-fighters too reached the spot and ambulances were stationed outside to deal with any eventuality.A senior police officer said though Rakesh seemed mentally unstable, it was too early to judge his mental status. “We will send him for a medical examination to determine that,” added the officer.Rakesh told the police that he was travelling in a bus towards Chandni Chowk when he overheard four men talking about bombs being placed in a car.He claimed the men were talking about visiting Parliament, prompting him to suspect that they were planning a bomb attack there. Thus, he called up the police.However, investigators are not taking any of his claims at face value.“Most likely, he is trying to mislead us. We are still investigating” a senior officer told The Hindu . So far, the police have learnt that Rakesh calls up the police control room frequently. However, the nature of these calls and the circumstances under which they were made are yet to be ascertained.
