Two living legends of music will regale audiences in the city this week. On January 15, Pandit Jasraj will present a Hindustani vocal concert, while Ghazal singer Ghulam Ali will perform on January 17.While Ghulam Ali has sung in Kozhikode before, it would be the first concert for Jasraj in the city.Disciple facilitates arrivalRamesh Narayan, his disciple who has evolved as a fine composer in Malayalam cinema, is instrumental in bringing him to Kozhikode.“He has given concerts in other cities in the State, including Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Thrissur, but I felt the music lovers of Kozhikode should also have the privilege of listening to him,” Ramesh told The Hindu onTuesday. “That is why the city-based cultural organisation KALA and I joined hands to conduct this programme.” He is confident that the show would be a success. “Kozhikode has always liked Hindustani music,” he said.“It has also given birth to composer M.S. Baburaj, who composed most of his melodies based on Hindustani ragas.”Kozhikode loves GhazalsKozhikode has always loved Ghazals. And many of the great Ghazal singers have performed here. Mehdi Hassan, Jagjit Singh, Talat Aziz and Bhupinder Singh were all big hits at the Malabar Mahotsavam, a festival of music and dance which, sadly, is no longer organised.“There was a big crowd when Ghulam Ali sang at the Kozhikode Malabar Mahotsavam in 2006,” said Ghazal singer Jitesh Sundaram, who had performed on the stage shortly before the maestro sang. “He had begun his showwith a Thumri, (Gore tore naina…) before going on to render some of his hugely popular Ghazals.” Some of his Ghazals, such as Chupke chupke…, Hungama kyon barpa…, Yeh dil yeh paagal dil…, and Hum ko kiske…areamong the most popular ever in the genre.
