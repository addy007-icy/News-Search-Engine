A one-year-old child diagnosed with liver cancer was given a second lease of life after the tumour was removed by surgeons of Manipal Hospitals in a “rare and critical” procedure here. The team of oncologists and surgeons saved 13-month-old Sanjana from a life threatening cancerous tumour.Medical oncologist Krishna Reddy said hepatoblastoma (type of liver cancer) was the most common primary liver tumour in children accounting for over one per cent of paediatric cancers. The primary treatment for the ailment was surgical liver resection (removal), however, chemotherapy played an important role by increasing the number of tumours that were respectable. The prognosis for patients with respectable tumours was fairly good, he said.“The baby was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and she responded well to three cycles of chemotherapy,” he said.Giving details of the surgery paediatric surgeon K .V. Ravi Kumar and surgical gastroenterologist M Manisegaran said, the child tolerated the surgery well and was under observation and intensive care for seven days.The child was discharged without any complications and would be on regular follow up for some time.Dr. Krishna Reddy said that such cases should be referred to tertiary care hospitals with experienced multi-disciplinary team. Child liver cancer treatment was feasible only in hospitals with facilities for liver resection or liver transplantation with good peri-operative support.Manipal Hospitals in Vijayawada had a Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator (CUSA) the first of its kind in the region needed in major liver resection and also in laparoscopic liver resection and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), Dr. Krishna Reddy said.
