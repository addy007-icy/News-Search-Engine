The PCB sees the issue differently. “We prioritised permanent pollution control facilities, rather than just the distance, for permitting new Hot Mix Plants in Kerala,” its chairman, K. Sajeevan, told The Hindu . This, according to him, was also because land availability was an issue in Kerala.“We were not giving approvals for a long time and this had affected road works. Ä committee comprising our officers and technical experts suggested means to avoid pollution from these plants and we decided to approve HMPs based on its recommendations,” Mr. Sajeevan added.PowersHe reasoned that the local panchayats anyhow had powers to shut down these plants, if they were later found to be a health hazard.Health experts, however, point out that permanent Hot Mixing Plants near residential areas were likely to create health problems. “Prolonged inhalation of chemicals they spew, like sulphur dioxide and poly aromatic chemicals, could cause cancer,” said Dr. Mathew Thomas, Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine and Haematology, KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.When contacted, A.P.M. Hanish, Principal Secretary, State Public Works Department, said: “Heavy rain in the last six months had damaged the roads in the State. This was a concern for the government and we needed to remove obstacles for work.”Mr. Hanish, however, denied that the Public Works Department had put any pressure on the government to take a decision on Hot Mix Plants.
