A group of women were jotting down the process of baking a vanilla-flavoured teacake as the trainer gave a detailed demonstration to them.In a corner of the hall, a few women were experimenting with floral fabric painting, sharing ideas on the colour combination that can go well with the sari they have decided to recreate.The women empowerment programme, started off in 2014 by Lions Club-Visakhapatnam, continues to rope in those who like to train, learn and take home a piece of art only to come up with ingenious solutions to be independent.The forum include crafts such as fabric painting, pot painting, glass painting, making cakes and chocolates, designing bags and saris, among a variety of other sessions. “The free training classes are meant to give a new direction to homemakers and unemployed women and encourage them to take up entrepreneurship. More than 400 women have been trained in various crafts so far and some of them have teamed up either to set up their own enterprise or work from home,” says Rajeswar Rao, zone chairman of the club.The avenue created a perfect ground for many to enhance their survival skills and share ideas on creative pursuits.“Unlike other courses that take hours to learn, quilling art is quick to get trained into. If one is little innovative, the craft can also be used to design greeting cards, artificial jewellery and mixed-media pieces,” says Jyothi, a trainee at the session.Participants said that the programme gave way to marketing opportunities as well. “We tend to improve our marketing techniques by showcasing our creations at the handicrafts exhibitions organised by the club. In the process, we get to understand the technicalities of the market, the trends that are in vogue and come up with our own innovative strategies to improve the business,” explains Kavitha, who finds that local exhibitions proved a lucrative platform for a new breed of designers to market their products.From hardly a dozen participants, the training programme now witnesses hundreds of women every week.More than 400 women have been trained in various crafts so far and some of them have teamed up either to set up their own enterprise or work from homeRajeswar RaoZone chairman, Lions Club-Visakhapatnam
