We again have come here in search of her through our common friends in the city,” Ayesha told The Hindu .The siblings had completed their schooling and higher education in Fajairah, one of the ten emirates (political territories) that form the UAE, and lived with their step-mother who incidentally hails from the city. “Our father died a few years ago and we are living with our paternal relatives.
