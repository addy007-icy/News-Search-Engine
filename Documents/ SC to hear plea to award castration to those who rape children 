The Supreme Court will decide on Monday on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Women Lawyers’ Association (SCWLA) seeking castration as a punishment for child rapists.It will be heard by the apex court even as new anti-rape laws have made rape punishable with the death penalty. SCWLA, represented by senior advocate Mahalaxmi Pavani, described its petition as a “feeble and strong appeal to this highest court of the country to come out in support of these innocent and unprotected children of our country.”The petition quotes passages from the works of ancient Greek tragedian Sophocles, observations made by Justice N.Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court and Union Minister Venkiah Naidu’s comments to back its plea.“When the law is ineffective and incapable of addressing the menace, this court cannot keep its hands folded and remain a silent spectator, unmoved and oblivious of the recent happenings of horrible blood-curdling gang rapes of children in various parts of India,” says the petition quoting Justice Kirubakaran in a recent judgment.It then goes on to quote the “reaction” of Minister for Urban Development Venkaiah Naidu to this judgment.“He said ‘Happy about the Madras High Court judgment. ‘Human Right’ is not a term restricted to, and only reserved for, offenders.’ ”It also quotes Sophocles: “Laws can never be enforced unless fear supports them.”
