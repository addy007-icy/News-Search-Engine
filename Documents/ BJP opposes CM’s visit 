Suresh, staged a protest near SJM College grounds, where the programme was organised.As the helicopter ferrying the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues reached the town, protesters waved BJP flags and raised slogans against the government.Mr. Suresh told reporters that the CM had come to Tarikere only to inaugurate the works sanctioned and approved during the BJP rule. “The present government has not sanctioned any new scheme or work for Tarikere. He has neglected developmental works in the constituency,” he said. The party workers had assembled at D.S. Suresh’s house, which is close to the helipad. As the helicopter reached, the police took protesters into custody.
