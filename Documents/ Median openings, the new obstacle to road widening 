The issue of median openings is posing difficulties for the officials involved with the widening of the Karamana-Pravachambalam stretch of the National Highway 66.The demand for an unscientific median opening at Karakkaramandapam along the 5.5-km stretch resulted in a tense situation on Monday, requiring the local police to intervene.As per the detailed project report (DPR), median openings will be created at six intersections at Neeramankara, Kaimanam, Pappanamcode, Karakkamandapam, Vellayani, and Nemom. The office-bearers of a religious institution nearby have been seeking a median opening, nearly 25 metres from the plan one planned, says an official. “Creating an opening at a short distance from a traffic signal will hamper traffic management and affect road users’ safety. It will also go against the guideline of the Indian Roads Congress that a minimum spacing of 500 metres be maintained between median openings along highways,” the official adds.There have also been demands to create openings, in addition to the planned ones, at Sreeragam junction (between Pappanamcode and Karakkamandapam), at nearly 300 metres from Nemom junction, and at Pazhayakarakkamandapam. Of these, the officials concede, the demand for a median opening at Pazhayakarakkamandapam is reasonable, considering there are no openings at distances of 500 metres on either sides.They maintain that the demands for median openings at the other points cannot be entertained, as they would defeat the purpose of constructing medians scientifically. However, the construction of medians at the disputed points has been abandoned until a consensus has been attained. With the latest development, it appears that the construction of the median will remain incomplete before January 13 when the widened stretch will be formally opened for traffic.Meanwhile, V. Sivankutty, MLA, who had to intervene to bring the issue under control on Monday, has called for resolving all problems to ensure public convenience. He called for upholding the guidelines to ensure the safety of road users on the highway stretch.
