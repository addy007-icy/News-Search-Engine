The Hubballi unit of the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) of India has condemned the suspension of Dalit research scholars in the University of Hyderabad and also mourned the death of research scholar Rohith Vemula who committed suicide.In a press release issued here, SIO Hubballi unit president Dawood Shaikh has said that the unjustified rustication of five Dalit research scholars and barring their entry was highly condemnable.He said that the continued rustication for 12 days had taken a ghastly turn with the suicide of Rohith Vemula, who was one among the students rusticated.Mr. Dawood has held the university administration responsible for the episode which ultimately resulted in the death of a student. SIO would seek a fair inquiry into the incident, he said.
