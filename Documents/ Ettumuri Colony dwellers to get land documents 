The seven Scheduled Caste families who live in a line building at Ettumuri Colony at Kurichy will soon get their land documents regularised, half a century after the colony started functioning.The colony was a line building, divided into seven rooms, each room occupied by a family. The land was handed over to residents, each with a right over 6.25 cents of land. However, the transfer of registry of these shares has not been done so far. So these families were excluded from the welfare measures of the State government.District Collector U.V. Jose said the land assignment would be regularised in the first phase by the office of the tahsildar at Changanassery. This will be followed by modernisation of the colony, he said. He said the plan was to construct new houses for the residents after they become owners of the land. The project includes a drinking water project for the colony.Meanwhile, the Sachivotamapuram Colony, the oldest Scheduled Caste Colony in the State, is also on the road to modernisation. Here too, the main hurdle to modernisation was land ownership. The residents have taken up the issue with the district authorities. Mr. Jose said the residentsâ€™ association had been asked to divide the land among the residents.Once the division is over and ownership regularised, the modernisation could begin.
