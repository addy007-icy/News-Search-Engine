Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor on Tuesday booked a two-bedroom flat in a housing project in Dubai. The veteran actor told reporters that it was his wife, Sunita Kapoor, who approved the deal in Mumbai a fortnight ago.“I am an actor and must admit that I do not have that nose for business, but my better half being Sindhi is apt at it,” he quipped. Calling Dubai his “second home”, he said the “deal appeared lucrative” as real estate was set to appreciate in value in the city.
