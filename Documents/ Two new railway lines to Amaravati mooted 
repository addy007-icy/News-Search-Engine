Following the submission of an action plan for providing railway connectivity to the capital city of Andhra Pradesh – Amaravati, officials of Vijayawada and Guntur divisions of South Central Railway (SCR) are exploring various options.They are looking at two possibilities that have emerged in the recent meeting of Members of Parliament with the SCR General Manager Ravindra Gupta.One is laying a direct line either from Sattenapalli or Pedakurapadu in Guntur-Nadikudi section and linking it to Mangalagiri via temple town of Amaravati and the three villages in seed capital (Uddandarayunipalem, Tallayapalem and Lingayapalem).The second one is a new line from Kondapalli running on a bridge proposed to be constructed across the River Krishna from Ibrahimpatnam. Kondapalli and Rayanapadu stations in Vijayawada division are the closest to the seed capital but constructing a railway bridge across River Krishna and laying a new line entail huge expenditure.Connecting the capital city with Sattenapalli-Guntur-Mangalagiri-Vijayawada line is fraught with issues of land acquisition as the new line has to cut across highly productive agricultural fields.No consensus yetMoreover, there is no consensus yet on the land acquisition cost sharing formula between the Centre and States. “If the States insist that Railways should bear the entire cost, it may back out of projects going purely by economics and returns,” an official of Vijayawada division said.On the other side is paucity of funds faced by Andhra Pradesh government post-bifurcation. The officials are exploring the two options but their feasibility and cost factor will be known after a survey is done by the designated agencies of Indian Railways. This (survey) is expected to be sanctioned soon by the Railway Board.For now, much depends on the third line between Gudur (Nellore district) and Duvvada (Visakhapatnam) that has been sanctioned by the Railway Board. Requests to divert some trains like Navjeevan Express, Tata Nagar Express and Grand Trunk Express via New Guntur station in the interregnum are under examination.
