The recorded announcement of bus stops in intra-city buses has been stopped on several routes. During a routine check conducted on buses at four depots, the authorities found over 80 buses not following the ‘protocol’ either knowingly or due to some technical problem.The idea behind on-board announcement is to help passengers know the next stop a few seconds before the stop approaches.The on-board announcement has been linked to the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), which was launched for the first time in the country in Mysuru to redefine urban transport.Under ITS, the bus stops too have passenger information boards to display real-time data on the arrival time of buses at that particular stop.A KSRTC source told The Hindu that sometimes bus drivers reduce the volume of the announcement system or put in on mute.There are also instances of wires disconnected from the system causing disruption and unattended to by the respective bus drivers and conductors or the staff at the depots. But, in most buses, there are digital screens which display the stops for the benefit of passengers and these screens are said to be functioning normally.However, a few old buses, which are on the verge of being phased off, lack such devices.It aims to help passengers know the next stop a few seconds before it approaches
