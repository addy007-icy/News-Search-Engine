Their tricolour sash injected a note of patriotism into the Thiruvananthapuram Revenue district school arts festival at Neyyattinkara here on Thursday.The seven-member team of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Vazhuthacaud, bagged the top slot in ‘Vande Mataram’ (upper primary) event for its excellent rendition of the song. Competing with 11 other teams, it was no cakewalk for Sanjana S., Bhuvana S.R., Unnimaya A.R., Krishna S., Krishnamoorthy Iyer L., Dev Sankar S.R., and Adithya Sankar S.R.They had 70 seconds to sing the song and get the words, pronunciation, and emphasis right. While the girls admitted to being nervous after seeing the first team’s performance, the boys claimed they had no butterflies in their stomach.The efforts of their music teacher Sreekala paid off when the students stepped on the stage next and did well. The remaining 10 teams were no lightweights, but they sensed serious competition only from the first one.Three days of practice during school hours, missed classes, and the backing of their teachers were enough to see them to victory.They continued the good run enjoyed by their school in the event and want to be back next year for the fete.
