Tension gripped a locality in Fatehpur district when members of two communities clashed during the ‘shobha yatra’ being taken out on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Thursday, police said.The members of two communities raised slogans and hurled brickbats at each other during the annual ‘shobha yatra’ in Kazipura Kasauli locality under Kasba Jehanabad police station area, IG (Law and Order) A. Satish Ganesh said here.A few shops and vehicles were damaged in the incident, the IG said.Strong reinforcements from the RAF and PAC were rushed to the affected area, while an alert was sounded in adjoining districts of Hamirpur, Kanpur and Kaushambi, he said.“The Zonal IG rushed to the area and the situation has been brought under control,” he added.Meanwhile, SP Fatehpur, Rajiv Malhotra said that Section 144 has been promulgated and a strict vigil is being maintained in the area.“People behind the incident are being identified and strict action will be taken against them,” he said.The trouble started when the yatra deviated from its traditional route and a section of people objected to it and a display of a model of proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya, officials said.Incidentally, VHP leader Pravin Togadia and Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjana Jyoti were in the town to attend a ‘Hindu Sangam’ programme at Ram Talaiya temple, also in Jehanabad.Both the leaders condemned the incident.Meanwhile Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) in Delhi condemned the attack on people participating in the yatra, terming it as a policy of minority appeasement.It also criticised the Akhilesh Yadav government saying it has turned a mute spectator to such attacks on the majority community.VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain lamented that the law and order in Uttar Pradesh was turning from bad to worse where the majority community was not even allowed security by the State government during their religious functions.“VHP will be forced to take to the streets in case the Uttar Pradesh government does not control ‘jihadi’ islamists in the state. Due to its minority appeasement policy, the Akhilesh government has turned a mute spectator to such attacks on the majority community and extremist elements continue to attack and pelt stones at religious yatras.“We condemn the attack and firing at those taking out a shobha yatra today. The repeated attacks by such elements is a cause of concern for the majority community in the state,” he said. PTIThe trouble started when the yatra deviated from its route and people objected to it
