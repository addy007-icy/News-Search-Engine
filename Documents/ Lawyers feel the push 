Lawyers of Delhi High Court are up in arms against the tendency of judicial administration to occupy the buildings on the court premises, including the chambers primarily meant for them, on the pretext of administrative exigencies. The latest instance is relating to a new chamber block to be constructed at a cost of Rs.100 crore.Though the chamber block will consist of ground plus seven floors with three basements, only 200 chambers will be allotted to advocates, as half of the area has already been reserved for the High Court’s administrative offices.The construction will start in April-end and the project is likely to be completed by the end of 2018.High Court Bar Association (HCBA) president Rajiv Khosla points out that even now, the entire ground floor and some rooms in Blocks II and III have been kept locked for judicial administration despite the availability of ample space in the Administrative Block. The HCBA’s demand for converting the space into cubicles for the Bar members, having no sitting space in the High Court, for holding conference with their clients at a nominal rate on an hourly basis has also not been met.Similarly, the demand for allotment of non-utilised chambers to lawyers on the waiting list is yet to be fulfilled. The HCBA has expressed surprise at the High Court administration’s decision to convert a huge vacant space originally meant for lawyers’ canteen into a video conference room “without any justification”.Mr. Khosla says this space could be utilised for providing office space to the public prosecutors and government counsels.Aggrieved by the judicial administration’s latest decision, the HCBA has decided to apprise Chief Justice G. Rohini of the issue in order to ensure that the space meant for advocates is not claimed and occupied once again by the administration.-----------------------------------Some senior cops at PHQ were full of praise for a particular Station House Officer (SHO) heading one of the police stations with a busy market area under its jurisdiction. Tagged as ‘plum postings’, all such police stations are sought-after by police inspectors whenever they are shortlisted for heading police stations.Flourishing business activities open the scope for bribe and the posting itself has in the past alleged to have been secured by greasing a few palms.It is said that this particular Inspector was handpicked by the Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi after repeated complaints about his predecessor reached the top brass of the police. An officer shared how since he has taken over, the Inspector goes from shop to shop, market to market “ordering” shopkeepers not to pay bribes to any of his subordinates and report if anyone asks for it. The message has percolated well ensuring deterrence among the beat constable, some of whom, predictably, are not very happy with this departure from past precedents.-----------------------------------Last week, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation — the only one of the three corporations not to be in a financial crisis — hit out against the Aam Aadmi Party Government for not releasing funds on time through an advertisement in newspapers.Though the government had issued a full-page advertisement to make its stand clear a few months ago, AAP leaders attacked the BJP-ruled SDMC for wasting money.However, sources in the civic body said that the cost of placing the advertisement in two Hindi language dailies was less than Rs.1 lakh. This, officials said, was nothing compared to the government’s Rs.526 crore publicity budget.But, the amount spent by the SDMC would have been more had their advertisement, which was issued by the Mayor, the Leader of the House and the Standing Committee chairperson, not been rejected by a leading Hindi daily.The newspaper in question declined the advertisement, with representatives saying that an advertisement targeting the government could lead to a loss of revenue from the government.(Contributed by Mohammed Iqbal, Shubhomoy Sikdar and Damini Nath)
