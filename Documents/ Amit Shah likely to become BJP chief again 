With the BJP notified January 24 as the date for the filing and scrutiny of nominations for the post of party chief, Amit Shah seems all set to be elected for a full three-year term.The saffron party’s convention is that just one consensus candidate files the nomination and is elected unopposed. Mr. Shah became party chief midway through Mr. Singh’s term as the latter joined the Cabinet. RSS leaders have met the BJP brass and are believed to have agreed to Mr. Shah as party chief, with some riders like being more consultative in his approach and accommodating leaders he may disagree with.
