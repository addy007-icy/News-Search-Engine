BCCI president Shashank Manohar has asked all the three members of its legal committee to independently submit a report based on the Supreme Court-appointed Justice RM Lodha panel’s recommendations suggesting the BCCI’s administrative overhaul.Manohar is understood to have sought a detailed response from the legal committee members during the legal committee meeting at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s facility at the Bandra-Kurla Complex on Sunday.It was the first time since the Lodha panel report was submitted on January 4 that the BCCI officially discussed its ramifications.Manohar, along with BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur, discussed the possible impact of Lodha committee report with the committee members P.S. Raman, D.V.S.S. Somayajulu and Abhay Apte. They were joined by top executives from Amarchand Mangaldas & Sons, the BCCI’s legal consultants.A BCCI insider revealed to The Hindu that the committee unanimously agreed that the Lodha report “ought to be taken very seriously”. He added that Manohar, himself a lawyer, then asked all the legal luminaries to individually study the report in great detail and revert with their suggestions in two weeks so that the BCCI can discuss its future course of action next month.Meanwhile, the BCCI disciplinary committee is set to discuss on Monday the replies of Pakistani umpire Asad Rauf and two cricketers — Mumbai’s Hiken Shah and Rajasthan Royals’ Ajit Chandila — for their alleged breach of anti-corruption code.While Shah was suspended since July, 2015 after allegedly making a corrupt approach to Rajasthan Royals’ leggie Pravin Tambe, Chandila has been suspended ever since he was arrested during the spot-fixing scandal in 2013.Rauf has also been alleged to have violated the anti-corruption code while officiating during the IPL’s 2013 edition.
