The Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) State president Dr. N. Ramchander has said that though the country became polio-free, the Government of India planned to organise Pulse Polio Programme (PPP) from time to time as the neighbouring nations such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are yet to be declared as polio-free.Taking part in the polio drops giving programme at municipal park at Saraswathi Nagar here on Sunday, he appealed to all the parents to cooperate with the governments in their effort to protect the children from the disease.The IAP was associated with the official machinery across the State in administering the drops to every child below 5 years, he said.Indian Medical Association president Dr. M. Vinodekumar Gupta was also present.The district administration, meanwhile, identified a total of 3,36,469 children aged between 0 and 5 years to administer polio drops in the current pulse polio programme. For which as many as 7,480 employees belonging to various departments were deployed.Special polio booths were set up at high risk areas such as railway stations, bus stands, anganwadis and primary health centres. Arrangements were also on to administer drops by going round door-to-door on January 18 and 19.Last time, 89 per cent of booth activity was completed, and hence the authorities aimed at surpassing it this time.Those who failed to provide polio drops to their children in the three days can go to government hospitals on January 20, said DMHO Dr. Venkat.
