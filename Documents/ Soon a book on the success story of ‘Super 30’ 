The success story of ‘Super 30’, a tutorial programme which prepares 30 students from economically backward sections for prestigious IIT-JEE every year, will soon hit the stands in the form of a book.A Canada-based doctor and psychiatrist of Indian origin, Biju Mathew, is writing a book on the inspiring story of the Patna-based institute, founded by Anand Kumar.It will be published by Penguin Books and Random House.“I came to know about the ‘Super 30’ and its founder Anand Kumar while reading an article in Global Mail newspaper and decided to invite him to Canada for a lecture,” Dr Mathew told PTI here on Wednesday.Dr Mathew, who has come here from Canada to take part in a conference of psychiatrists, said: “I have decided to write a book on ‘Super 30’ being run under the banner of ‘Ramanujan School of Mathematics’ after watching Kumar’s dedication and craving for helping students belonging to backward sections.”“The way he has dedicated himself to the cause for the past 14 years, is not a small thing. Normally, after attaining name, fame, and money, people switch over to the luxuries of life. But to remain committed to the goal for such a long period is remarkable and unthinkable,” he said.“That’s why I’ve decided to write a book on its success story to inspire generations. I spent a lot of time at his home in Patna, at his humble classroom and interacted with current and past students, whose life he has changed single-handedly,” he said.Dr Mathew said he also met Mr Kumar’s mother and other family members to gain insight into his life.The book has about 250 pages divided into six-seven chapters and will hit stands in about two-three months, he said.When asked why he chose Dr Mathew, a psychiatrist, over any conventional author to write a book on ‘Super 30’, Mr Kumar said, “Because I felt that he has experience in writing story. He has written a lot of stories of people with mental problems and has in—depth knowledge.”“Also he did a lot of research and came to Patna twice. He visited my native place, my old school and met with many (of my) friends and students. He travelled from Patna to Kolkata to get a feel of my father’s journey. And visited Varanasi to see the Central Library to know how I spent my time there. I found that no one can do research like Mathew.”‘Super 30’ is a highly ambitious and innovative educational programme running under the banner of ‘Ramanujan School of Mathematics’.It hunts for 30 talented students from among the economically backward sections of the society and coaches them for the Joint Entrance Examination for admission in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT).Over the years the coaching programme has recorded tremendous success and attracted global attention. -- PTI
