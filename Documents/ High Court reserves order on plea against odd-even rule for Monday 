The Delhi High Court on Friday reserved its order for Monday on a bunch of writ petitions challenging the odd-even rule for vehicles enforced on the city roads since January 1, after the Aam Aadmi Party government defended the scheme, saying the per capita toxic gas emission had reduced as a result of less four-wheelers on the roads.The scheme, originally stipulated for 15 days, will continue at least till January 11, when a Division Bench of the High Court, led by Chief Justice G. Rohini, pronounces its order on the petitions. The Delhi government affirmed during the hearing that the peak pollution had been recorded at its lowest level since the scheme was launched.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Delhi government, said since the pollution level in the city had shown a consistently declining trend, especially during the peak traffic hours, the Environment Pollution Control Authority for NCR had opined that the odd-even scheme could be continued beyond 15 days.Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai, Delhi Dialogue Commission vice-chairman Ashish Khetan and Centre for Science and Environment Director-General Sunita Narain were present in the court hall to attend the hearing.
