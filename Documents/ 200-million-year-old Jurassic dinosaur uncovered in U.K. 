A new carnivorous dinosaur species uncovered in the Wales, dating back 200 million years, is possibly the oldest known Jurassic dinosaur from the United Kingdom, according to a new study.Researchers analysed the dinosaur skull and bones, discovered in 2014 on a beach near Penarth, Wales, and concluded it is a new species that they have named Dracoraptor hanigani.The dinosaur species was identified by David Martill from the University of Portsmouth, U.K., and colleagues from National Museum Wales and University of Manchester.It was meat-eatingFrom their analysis, the researchers believe this dinosaur was meat-eating, from the theropod group.They also suggested that it may have been a juvenile animal, as most of its bones were not yet fully formed or fused.Compared to its distant relative the ‘T rex,’ it appears to be a small, agile animal, probably only about 70 cm tall and about 200 cm long, with a long tail, likely to help it balance.Go back 201 million yearsIt lived at the beginning of the Jurassic Period (201 million years ago), at the time when south Wales was a coastal region like it is today.However, at the time, the climate was much warmer, and dinosaurs were just starting to diversify.The new specimen represents the most complete theropod from Wales, and may possibly represent one of the oldest known Jurassic dinosaurs in the U.K. or even in the world.Now we know better“The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event is often credited for the later success of dinosaurs through the Jurassic and Cretaceous, but previously we knew very little about dinosaurs at the start of this diversification and rise to dominance,” researchers said.“Now we have Dracoraptor, a relatively complete two-metre-long juvenile theropod from the very earliest days of the Jurassic in Wales,” they said.The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.
