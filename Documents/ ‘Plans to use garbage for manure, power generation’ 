Plans are being drawn to process the garbage lifted from the city, so that it can be used as manure and for power generation, IT and Panchayat Raj Minister K.T. Rama Rao said here on Wednesday. Participating in an orientation programme organised by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) here, Mr. Rao said about 5,000 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city every day, of which 4,000 metric tonnes is lifted. Requisite plans are being drawn up to use it for manure and power generation after proper segregation, he said. The GHMC has taken up a lot of scientific initiatives for solid waste management and it was the only corporation to provide two dust bins to each household for dry and wet waste segregation.
