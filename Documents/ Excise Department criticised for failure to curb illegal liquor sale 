The Legislature Committee on Women and Child Welfare criticised Excise Department officials for their alleged failure to curb the illegal sale of liquor in rural areas and urged for action.The former Minister and Chairman of the Legislature Committee on Women and Child Welfare Malikayya Guttedar who chaired a review meeting here on Thursday,expressed its deep dissatisfaction over the failure to end the menace of illegal sale of liquor.“The general complaint of the women in the villages was about the sale of illegal liquor in the unauthorised outlets. During my visits to the villages in the district, I see more drunkards than in the past. What prevented you from conducting raids and ending this menace?” asked Mr Guttedar. The family of Mr. Guttedar, who are into the liquor business for the past several years, said that he had never intervened in the functioning of the department.The committee also expressed its displeasure over the handling of the cases pertaining to the atrocities on women and children.“This is wrong….the cases of atrocities against women should be taken to logical end and work in the direction of getting conviction to the perpetuators of the crime,” he said.‘General complaint of the women in villages is aboutthe sale of illegal liquor’
