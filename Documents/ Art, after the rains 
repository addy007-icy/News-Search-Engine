It was just like the week after the floods. Everybody spoke about rains and ruins; relief and resilience. At a fundraiser organised by The Artists’ Conclave and Art Houz Gallery, a bunch of artists, art enthusiasts and Rotarians recalled the horror of the past, before divulging into discussions about sunny colours and canvas. Artist Kalpana Yuvarraaj, a Rotarian and curator of the show, titled Mythology Revisited, says the event is their small contribution to society.While the artworks celebrate the culture of the city, the funds collected from them will be used for the Revive Chennai project by Rotary Club of East R.A. Puram. On December 6, Kalpana recalls being in the relief camps, distributing sanitary napkins, food packets and blankets, along with fellow artists. “But that was just some small help we could do then — people now need something tangible; something with which they can start their life again,” she says. That’s when she messaged the artists on Whatsapp, asking them if they wished to contribute. Responses came in no time — in exactly a month, she curated a show (inaugurated on January 5). Around 20 artists, including seniors such as V. Dhakshinamurthy, G. Raman and Augustine Annadurai, among others, have shown support.Rtn. B. Ragunathan, president of the club, says, “We have come up with a kit that contains 35 products, and includes basic needs such as a stove, sari, napkins and blanket. Each kit costs Rs. 3,300, and we have already distributed it to around 1,000 families. That apart, we would also be using the funds to provide vocational training for children and help small businesses get back on their feet.” Kalpana’s work, depicting a form of Krishna, was sold for R. 60,000 on the first day.
