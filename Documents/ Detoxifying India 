This is with reference to the preliminary findings of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) that stated that the consumption of tobacco and alcohol in India has fallen (“ >India drinks and smokes less now”, Jan.24). The holistic public health campaigns — with the use of graphic displays on cigarette packets to forewarn smokers, restrictions on smoking on cinema and television and ban on smoking in public places — seem to have worked in reining in this public health menace.A.J. Rangarajan,Edison, New Jersey The data released by NFHS-4 mark victory for anti-tobacco campaigners. Awareness campaigns — through street-plays and short documentaries — have contributed immensely to educating people on the negative impact of tobacco consumption. However, there is still a lot of ground to cover as smoking is becoming popular among the youth, affecting their health and education.When it comes to alcohol, in many States, 25 is the legal age for consumption but pubs and bars serve liquor to teenagers even as the administration looks the other way. Also, an increase in use of other tobacco products like gutka must be of great concern to authorities. The government and the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have to now shift their focus to rural areas where a major proportion of tobacco-consuming population still lives.Gagan Pratap Singh,Noida
