The RBDCK must urgently build a flyover at congested and accident-prone Collectorate junction, Campaign for Economic and Most Appropriate Transport System for Kochi (Cemats-Kochi) has demanded.The agency must also ensure pavements and footpaths all along Airport-Seaport Road to ensure safety of pedestrians. The road shoulder is uneven in many places, while shrubs have encroached into the road at numerous other places in the corridor, making it unsafe to walk.
