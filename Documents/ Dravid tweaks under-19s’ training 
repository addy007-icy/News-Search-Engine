Rahul Dravid commands respect for his response to crisis situations, contribution as a team player and knack of reinventing himself as a batsman across various formats. He brings the same nose for novelty to coaching, putting the India U-19 players through an adventure camp in Ramanagaram, near Bengaluru.The colts, currently playing warm-up matches against Board President’s XI at the Cricket Club of India before leaving for Bangladesh for the Under-19 World Cup, spent a night out doing team-building activities ranging from rappelling to rock climbing to various games. The outing was planned and initiated by Dravid during the team’s preparatory camp in Bengaluru earlier this month.Paras Mhambrey, team bowling coach, explained the reasoning behind Dravid move. “Players come from different backgrounds. Skills are there, such visits helps team-building, when having fun at the same time.“We did rappelling, rock climbing and team games. It helps the group bond away from the game,” said Mhambrey.“Players showed anxiety initially, then with a bit of cajoling by teammates overcame their fear of heights. Other groups got involved, there was a bit of leg-pulling.”Manager Anil Patel informed that Dravid had tried to organise similar team activity at a beach in Colombo during a triangular series involving England and Sri Lanka developmental squads, but permission was not granted from the Lankan authorities due to rain and choppy waters.The Indian colts played two practice games at the Cricket Club of India against Board President’s XI, again the result of a request from Dravid to the BCCI for match practice against experienced opponents. The former India captain demonstrated man-management ability with Rajasthan Royals in IPL, as captain/coach, later as coach.
