A team of doctors, led by corneal surgeon Veeresh Korwar, has performed a surgery on a four-month-old baby to replace cornea in the left eye to enable the child suffering from secondary corneal scar and corneal ulcer to regain vision, at the Basaveshwar Teaching and General Hospital here.Medical Superintendent of the hospital S.R. Harwal said here on Thursday that the surgery was performed under the guidance of senior ophthalmologist Vishwanath Reddy and anaesthetist Pratima Kamreddy. Post-operation, the baby is doing well and is now able to see with the operated eye.Corneal scarring and corneal ulcer blocks vision, and the eye, in a developing stage in the case of the four-month-old baby, needs to have a clear cornea to achieve normal vision. If left unattended, the child will become blind for life and live without vision in one eye, Dr. Harwal said.Dr. Harwal said that an eye that was donated recently to the Eye Bank and Keratoplasty Centre in the hospital helped the doctors use the cornea from the donorâ€™s eye to provide vision to the baby. The Eye Bank in the hospital was started in September 2009 and so far, 80 eyes have been donated to it. The donated eyes have been used to provide vision to blind people.
