A group of Delhi University students on Friday cycled from Civil Lines to Arts Faculty in North Campus in support of the Delhi government’s odd-even plan, that kicked off for a 15-day trial period from Friday.While colleges are closed for winter break till January 4, the students decided to make a beginning by cycling to the campus from their homes and vowed to continue doing so during the rest of the year.One of the cyclists said: “It’s a wonderful way to start the new year. I think we all should make a new year resolution to cycle more often and leave our vehicles home whenever possible.”Another cyclist, a student of Hindu College, added: “The formula might pose certain difficulties in the beginning as a majority of the people find travelling by cars comfortable. However, we have to make a start somewhere and nothing better than starting right now.”The vehicular restriction policy of the Delhi government came into effect as the clock struck 8 a.m., with thousands of volunteers taking to the streets to assist the traffic police in enforcing the pilot plan, that will stay in force in the Capital till January 15.As per the scheme, violation of the scheme will attract a penalty of Rs.2,000 under relevant Sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.
