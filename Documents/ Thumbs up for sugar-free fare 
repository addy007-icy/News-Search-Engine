The decision to reserve a separate counter for serving ‘sugar-free’ food at the ‘Oottupura’ has turned out to be a wise one. A large number of people were seen making a beeline for that counter on Saturday.Actor Kochupreman is trying to see as many performances as possible at the festival. “The students are performing really well,” he says. “I particularly liked the Kuchipudi by the Higher Secondary girls at the Poojappura Ground; the judges would have had a tough time in deciding the winners.”The green protocol volunteers have been striving admirably to ensure that the venues of the festival remained plastic-free. The students have had to face the ire of many for having stopped them with plastics. “We have found it hard to convince media persons and a few others in supporting us,” a volunteer told your correspondent at the Government GHSS Cotton Hill.A number of Oppana contestants had to be rushed to the medical aid stall at the Putharikandam Ground after they experienced dizziness. Almost every other team had members who sank on to the stage in exhaustion after the curtain came down. A stretcher was made available near the stage after the first few incidents.Confrontations between parents and judges have been a feature of this festival. The Tabla competition venue on Saturday witnessed one even before the event began. The story started from Friday, when the competition for the high school section was held. Only three of the students got ‘A’ grades in that event. When the same judges from that competition came to judge the Higher Secondary competition, some of the parents objected saying that they are not qualified enough to judge. (Contributed byR.K.
