Union Law minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda came down heavily on the State government, alleging that it had not spent even 30 percent of its budget allocation in its tenure. During his visit to the city to participate in a party workers’ meeting, he told presspersons that the Union government had released Rs. 1,540 crore for drought relief, but the State government had not spent the money. “The State government keeps criticising the Centre. They blamed the Centre for the delay in releasing funds. In fact, the State government delayed the process by not furnishing documents in time. Even after the release of funds, they have not spent it,” he said.White Paper soughtDemanding a White Paper on funds provided by the Centre and expenditure made so far, Mr. Gowda said, “We have documents to show that the Centre released funds. Let the State government announce what it has done with that.” Under the Suvarna Gram scheme, the government selected 1,000 villages and allocated only Rs. 189 crore, he pointed out. “How much will each village get if only Rs. 189 crore is allocated for so many villages,” he wondered.Regarding the Congress’ win in the Local Authority Constituencies, Mr. Gowda said it was because of the misuse of power and money. The government machinery put pressure on gram panchayat members and ensured they voted for their candidate, he alleged.Former Minister V. Somanna said the Union government had released funds for gram panchayats. However, the State government had not passed it on to the local bodies, and instead adjusted the same for electric bills pending for years. “This shows how much the government is committed to the strengthening of local bodies,” he said.
