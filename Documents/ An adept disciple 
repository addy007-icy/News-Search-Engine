Bangalore-based Bharatanatyam dancer Kirti Ramgopal received her foundational training from Padmini Ramachandran while Priyardarsini Govind taught her the nuances of abhinaya. All this came through in Kirti’s dance, which was replete with traditional pieces. At Priyadarsini’s behest, Kirti also learnt from A. Laxman. Her smile revealed her ease in both nritta and abhinaya (with guidance from Bragha Bessel).She began with Mallari, which is always in Gambhira Nattai, composed by Balasubramanya Sharma. She chose diverse ways to describe the elephant-headed god, with a keen sense of form and space, marked by neat footwork.She next brought out the subtleties in emotions through verses from Krishna Karnamrutam by Bilvamangala Swami, which had music by Jahnavi Jayaprakash in Hindolam. To be able to show that when Krishna kissed, he reeked of butter was something this reviewer appreciated. However, a little more liveliness could have enhanced her depiction of Krishna’s pranks. The change of mood to hurt and anger was handled well by Kirti in ‘Idahi Vide’ by Subbarama Iyer in Saveri.Nandakumar Unnikrishnan’s full-throated singing added weight to the portrayal of the characters.The thillana in Simhendra Madhyamam, adi tala, displayed the good training Kirti has received in nritta. Pulikeshi Kasturi, the nattuvanar, was responsible to a large extent for the success of the programme. Harsha Samaga on the mridangam and Natraj Murthy on the violin lent admirable support.
