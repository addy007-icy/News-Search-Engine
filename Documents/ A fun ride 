The film, which has Suraj Venjaramoodu voicing the main character, is now available in stores.Suraj voices Kumaran, a cattle egret. This is the first time Suraj is lending his voice in an animated movie. Kumaran is a villager, who moves to the city in search of greener pastures. He falls for his boss’ daughter Chandini. Although the film does focus on a serious topic, environmental degradation, it has been handled in a light-hearted manner.The film, according to K.S. Madhu, managing director of Hibiscus Digital Media, was inspired by a garbage dump at the Attakulangara bypass. Cattle egrets used to visit and scavenge the dump for food before it was levelled recently. Videos of it are available on YouTube.Says Madhu: “Although Hibiscus is a familiar name with those familiar with the Malayalam animation industry, this is our first attempt at a full fledged film. The film is a family entertainer; it has laughs and food for thought.”While the VCD version of Mr. Kumaran – Oru Nattukokkinte Selfie is priced at Rs. 100, the DVD is priced at Rs. 125.
