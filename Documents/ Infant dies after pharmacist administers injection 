An 18-month-old baby girl, who was suffering from fever, has died in Periyapatna after a local pharmacist administered an injection without the doctor’s prescription. Superintendent of Police Abhinav Khare told The Hindu that the pharmacist, Ganapathi (50), has been arrested and an FIR filed.The baby was taken to the pharmacist, who also runs an illegal clinic, on January 3 by the parents, who are daily wage workers.“The first dose of injection was given on January 3, followed by two more on January 5 and 7 when the baby’s fever did not abate,” a police official said.When the baby’s condition worsened, the parents admitted her to the government hospital in Periyapatna, where she died on January 11. The parents buried the baby after her death.It was only after their neighbours alerted them that the parents lodged a complaint with the police on January 16. Soon after receiving the complaint, the accused was arrested, said Additional Superintendent of Police Kala Krishnaswamy.Preliminary investigation has revealed that the pharmacist, an ex-serviceman, does not hold MBBS degree, but used to run the clinic along with his pharmacy, where he used to dispense medicines for fever, cough and other ailments.Though he claimed to possess documents and licence to operate the pharmacy, investigation is still under way, the police said.
