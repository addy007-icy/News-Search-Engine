Karan Trivedi registered a century (103, 169b, 14x4, 5x6) and M.A. Hingrajia scored an unbeaten 96 (181b, 11x4, 1x6) as Gujarat under-19 put up a vastly improved performance on day three of its Cooch Behar Trophy semifinal against Mumbai under-19 in Valsad.When stumps were drawn at the Sardar Patel Stadium on Wednesday evening, the host had posted 353 for seven, still 158 behind. Yuvaraja Kosamia (47 batting, 97b, 5x4, 1x6) was keeping Hingrajia company.The duo has already added 82 runs for the eighth wicket.Resuming on 57 for three, Gujarat lost Rahul Shah (11) in the ninth over of the day. Trivedi added 52 runs with Kavish Panchal (28), before the latter was caught and bowled by Mumbai skipper Shams Mulani.Trivedi then found an able ally in Hingrajia, and the pair stitched a crucial 129-run stand for the sixth wicket to take Gujarat to safety. However, seamer Minad P. Manjrekar returned to remove Trivedi soon after he completed a century.The scores: Mumbai under-19 511 in 134.4 overs (Prithvi Shaw 62, Shams Mulani 80, Sairaj Patil 183 n.o., Sidak Singh 46, Yuvaraja Kosamia five for 150) vs Gujarat under-19 353 for seven in 133 overs (Karan Trivedi 103, M.A. Hingrajia 96 n.o.).
