Only 30 persons had got title deeds under it.The land regularisation process under Section 94C was faster in Dakshina Kannada when compared to Udupi district.The district administration should take steps to expedite process of giving title deeds by January 10. The Udyog (employment) Mela organised in Dakshina Kannada district was successful. Such an Udyog Mela would also be held in Udupi district. This would help the unemployed youth to get jobs.The K. Kasturirangan Panelâ€™s Report on Conservation of Western Ghats had created fear of eviction in the minds of people living on the border areas of Western Ghats. The opinion of these people had already been collected in the district.The State Cabinet had already decided to recommend to the Centre to reduce the area of Ecologically Sensitive Zone from 10 kilometres to one kilometre.He would urge the Minister for Forests and Environment B.
