A bathing place which is called gundam in the local parlance is an architectural marvel. It is located at Ragunatha Swamy and Janakamma ashramam that was constructed about 400 years ago.One can have darshan of the ‘samadhis’ of Raghunatha Swamy and Janakamma there in the ashram spread over five acres. From the top of the floor there is a tunnel and one has can come down straight without bending. Then crawl for a few feet where one can see ‘Shiva Lingam’ on Panavattam, a base to keep Shivalingam in traditional system. However, it seems that both are not of same period as the Panavattam seems to be removed and brought from some other place to keep Shivalingam.On the right side, there is a gundam (bathing place- well) which stands as architectural marvel. It is a square structure having entry from the west side through steps. One can walk around the well on the platform and step down to the water available point very comfortably. There, adjacent to the platform are two separate enclaves to sit and offer prayers at four sides were carved. It is stated that at the bottom of the gundam one huge Shivalingam is kept but it could be visible only if the water level is less in the gundam. Though it was informed that there is a tunnel way from the gundam to temple it is not in operation. “Our elders said that this was constructed about 400 years ago by a local person who experienced miracle impact of the water available here. Since then, this well is being treated as a place of miracles. Raghunatha Swamy celebrations will be held in the month of December,” said Mr. Rangaiah, a resident of the mandal headquarters.
