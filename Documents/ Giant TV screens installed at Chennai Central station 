Poor quality of screens and jarring noise of the public address system have been a complaint of passengers and visitors at the Chennai Central station. These, however, may be a thing of the past with the Southern Railway installing a couple of giant LED screens in addition to plasma TVs at this bustling station.Three LED screens have been installed on the concourse of the station where passengers wait to board long-distance trains.While the screen at the centre displays the arrival and departure of trains, the two screens flanking it telecast entertainment shows, commercials, movie trailers and other messages.The screens were installed over a month ago.A number of small LED screens have also been connected.“The giant screens are helpful. Earlier, we had to crowd around small TV screens to be updated with timings of train arrivals and departures,” said Narendra, a software professional who was waiting to board a train.
