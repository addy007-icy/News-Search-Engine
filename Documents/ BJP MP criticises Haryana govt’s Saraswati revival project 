BJP-led Haryana government’s much hyped Rs 50 crore ‘Saraswati Revival Project’ has found a critique in party MP Raj Kumar Saini who has condemned the government’s initiative to dig tubewells at various places to run water into the Saraswati river.The BJP MP from Kurukshetra, known for his campaign against Jat reservation, has raised many questions over the restoration project.“Only by installing tubewells, dreams cannot be fulfilled,” Mr Saini said during a district vigilance committee meeting here.Will the Saraswati start flowing after installing a tube well? People’s money should be used only for appropriate works, he said.The Centre and the state government are working on the project to restore the mythical Sarasvati river. It is being claimed that the waters from the underneath Saraswati had already oozed out at Kalleaam near Jagadhari, and that tube wells are being dug in Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra to run water into the Saraswati drains.Meanwhile, an RSS leader Indresh Kumar had inaugurated Sarasvati restoration work at Pipli during a ‘Gita Jyanti Samaroh’ here last month, but the tubewell failed to work at the time of the inauguration.Local BJP MLA Subhash Sudha had ordered an enquiry into the tubewell failure.Mr Saini, however, noted that he was not against the restoration project but it was his personal view that if the water had oozed out at few places from underneath the river, there was no need to install tubewells.The BJP MP, in comments that may spark a row, noted that there was no need for the Upper House as it was causing severe damage to the country.Lashing out at the Rajya Sabha members, where the BJP-led Centre does not have a majority, for “not clearing various crucial Bills”, Mr Saini said that after seeing the ‘drama’ there during last six seasons, it seems that the “House is meant only to stall the work”.The Members of Parliament pass the Bills as per aspirations of the people but the Upper House stall them, he added. - PTI
