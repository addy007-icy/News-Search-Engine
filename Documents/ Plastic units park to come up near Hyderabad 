Plastics as a sector is among 14 thrust areas identified by Telangana Government for industrial development and there are plans to establish a park for the units on 100 acres near Hyderabad.Stating this at a conference of the Telangana and Andhra Plastics Manufacturers Association (TAAPMA) here on Friday, Industries Minister Jupally Krishna Rao urged entrepreneurs to make most of the industry-friendly policies and stance of the State Government. Highlighting the industrial policy unveiled by the State and the legislation guaranteeing speedy and deemed clearances, the Minister said favourable weather and skilled manpower are a few other strong points of Hyderabad.The State Government, he added, is coming up with a plastics park on 100 acres near Mahankali in Maheswaram Mandal, near Hyderabad. The facility will essentially be for reinforced and engineering plastics units.Hyderabad is already a plastics processing hub across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, he said, while referring to the various areas, including automobiles and electronics, where the polymer material has become a preferred alternative.With regard to emerging opportunities in Telangana, Mr. Rao said that the water grid programme, unveiled by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to provide protected water to all the households by 2019, is one such.Senior leader of TAAPMA and president of Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTAPCCI) Anil Reddy Vennam said that growth opportunities in the plastics industry are endless. The need of the hour is for unitholders to comply with the government norms and refrain from manufacturing plastic bags of less than 40 microns.Commissioner of Industries K. Manicka Raj said plastics was one of thrust areas and the State Government was keen on taking the sector to greater heights. He urged the association to share with the Government the outcome of the conference, particularly the concerns and opportunities for the units.TAAPMA president Venu Gopal Jasti said that a key pointer to potential for growth that exists is relatively less per capita consumption of plastics in the country when compared with other developing countries. On the issue of pollution, he said that the problem lay in indiscriminate disposal of plastics.
