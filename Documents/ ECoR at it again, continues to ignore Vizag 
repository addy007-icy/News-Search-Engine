The Bhubaneswar-based East Coast Railway (ECoR) has rejected the demand of DRM Waltair for re-routing of 12245/12246 Howrah-Yesvantapur-Howrah Duronto Express (five days a week), 12552 Kamakhya-Yesvantapur-Kamakhya Weekly Express and 22863/22864 Howrah-Yesvantapur-Howrah AC Express (introduced on January 13) via Visakhapatnam Railway Station.The ECoR headquarters said 12245/12246 Duronto is having no commercial stoppage en route and hence may not be re-routed.It maintained that 12551/12552 and 22863/22864 are also running in the path of 12245/12246 Duronto, and hence may not be re-routed according to information, obtained by BH. Suryanarayana Rao of Hyderabad, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.12245/12246 Duronto reaches Bhubaneswar 4.55 p.m. and leaves at 5 p.m. and reaches Vizianagaram at 10.05 p.m. and leaves 10.15 p.m. without any halts in between those two stations, according to the Railway timetable.Interestingly, the 22863 Howrah-Yesvantapur weekly AC express, reaches Bhubaneswar at 4.50 p.m. and leaves at 4.55 p.m., just five minutes ahead of Duronto, but reaches Vizianagaram at 10.05 p.m. even after stopping in between for a total of 17 minutes at Khurda Road and Brahmapur.An RTI activist wonders: “When 22863 cannot be routed through Visakhapatnam on the plea that it is running in the path of the Duronto, how can it be given additional halts in Odisha?”The timings have been adjusted to squeeze in the additional halts.The same was the case when 10 bypassing trains were re-routed through Visakhapatnam in the recent past.Contrary to claims, there was no change in the running schedule of those re-routed trains, though engine reversal takes place in Visakhapatnam.MP K. Haribabu had earlier written to Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu demanding re-routing of 12245/46 through Visakhapatnam.The “biggest station next to Howrah and Yesvantapur in this route is conveniently ignored for reasons unknown. Though reversal takes place at Visakhapatnam, crew change, loco changing, train examining and other important platform facilities cannot be kept aside. Deploying skeleton staff other than Visakhapatnam will be a security concern and a burden to the railways,” he added.Rajya Sabha Member T. Subbarami Reddy wrote to Railway Board Chairman A.K. Mittal on Tuesday demanding re-routing of both the trains and correction of the anomaly to enable the railways to earn revenue apart from passenger convenience.
