he State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Monday pulled up the State government for dragging its heels over the Cochin Cancer and Research Centre (CCRC) project and sought reports from the authorities concerned on completion of the project.In a sitting at the District Collectorate in Ernakulam, Commission chairman J.B. Koshy noted that though a governing body of the proposed centre, the Cochin Cancer and Research Centre Society, was constituted about two months ago, no progress had been made.Similarly, a building to house the out-patient wing of the institution was almost ready, but no decision regarding the posting of doctors or the purchase of equipment has been made.“Even if an out-patient wing starts functioning here, they will have to refer the patients to other hospitals after a preliminary examination as the centre lacks the facility for treating these patients,” Mr. Koshy observed.The Commission also directed the State to take a decision on an offer by the District Cooperative Bank to give Rs.450 crore as loan for the project and also on receiving contributions from interested parties.The SHRC directed the Project’s Special Officer (General) and the Health Department Secretary to file separate reports detailing these aspects before its next sitting on February 22.A progress report filed by Asha Thomas, Special Officer (General) of the project, to the SHRC stated that the Public Works Department had already awarded the tender for constructing the out-patient facility and the work began on December 18.“The governing body of the CCRC society is expected to meet soon to decide on further matters of the Society as well as the project, for which the convenience of the Chief Minister and Health Minister have been sought.”Nursing staffMeanwhile, another report filed by K. Sudarsanan, Additional Secretary, Health Department, stated that the Special Officer (General) has been given the permission to appoint nursing staff based on the Regional Cancer Centre norms and a proposal to renovate the building for opening the cancer centre has been submitted to the State government. The project has been granted a fund of Rs.10 crore under the supplementary demand for grants and steps are in place to hand over the amount to the Special Officer (General).State told to take a decision on DCB Bank offer to give Rs.450 crore as loan for the project
