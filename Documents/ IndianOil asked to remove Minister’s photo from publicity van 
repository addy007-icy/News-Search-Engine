The on-going cold war between the BJP and the BJD to take credit for setting up of the 15 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) refinery reached a flash point when Jagatsinghpur district administration detained a publicity van and later let it off with warning to remove picture of Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, on Wednesday.Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to Odisha to dedicate Paradip Refinery to nation on February 7, IndianOil had flagged off 30 vans for spreading awareness about the refinery and a number of central government schemes through audio-visual clips. These vans have large photographs of the Prime Minister and the Union Minister.The BJD leadership had, however, opposed the move alleging that the PSU’s resources were being misused for political purpose.One of the publicity vans was on Wednesday temporarily detained at Balikuda in Jagatsinghpur and later let off with a warning that the Supreme Court guideline of using photos of only three dignitaries -- the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India -- in government advertisements should be honoured.Photographs of Mr. Pradhan, a senior BJP leader, should not be used, Jagatsinghpur district administration advised, adding that if it were not followed further course of action would be taken accordingly.The regional party was upset as the audio-video clips were not only advertising the central government schemes but also obliquely criticising the issue of ‘central negligence’, an issue often highlighted by the BJD.The BJP has already made attempts to take credit for establishment of Paradip Refinery by putting up hoardings at different places. Party leaders say it was former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee who laid the foundation for the mega project while the UPA government delayed its implementation. The party has already started mobilising supporters for Prime Minister’s proposed public meeting at Paradip.The Naveen Patnaik-led BJD said the project would not have been possible had the State government not facilitated land, water and other basic resources.
