The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Aam Aadmi Party government if the odd-even rule for restriction on vehicles on roads, introduced by it on an experimental basis, could be discontinued by Friday, while directing it to submit the data indicating changes in pollution levels in the Capital since January 1 when the scheme was launched.Hearing a bunch of public interest writ petitions on the subject, a Division Bench headed by Chief Justice G. Rohini observed that a great inconvenience was being caused to the public at large due to inadequate public transport infrastructure in the city.The court asked Delhi governmentâ€™s standing Counsel Rahul Mehra to explain what was the need for continuing with the scheme till January 15, if the data on pollution levels had already been collected for facilitating the future course of action.Posting the case for further hearing on Friday, the Bench observed that there were several practical difficulties with the odd-even policy. It asked the Delhi government to file a status report with the data on pollution levels in different parts of the city till Thursday on the next date of hearing.
