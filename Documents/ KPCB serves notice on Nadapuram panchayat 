: The functioning a garbage treatment plant set up by the Nadapuram grama panchayat nearly six years ago has hit a roadblock with the finding of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) that the plant had been functioning without following any of the stipulated rules and regulations prescribed by the KSPCB.A showcause notice recently served to the panchayat secretary states that the plant was functioning without even arranging the basic facilities such as incinerator and the biogas plant. It also alleged that no solid waste management and handling rules were followed at the plant, where the solid waste items, including plastics, are burnt in the open space creating huge environmental pollution.The KSPCB officials who visited the plant for an inspection on December 18 following protests and written complaints also confirmed that the panchayat had no valid permit to run the plant or any authorisation from any of the legal bodies to handle solid waste treatment project. The practise of burying the garbage using soil too was unscientific as chances were high for pollution of potable water sources in the area, they pointed out.KSPCB officials visited the plant following a written petition filed by Nadapuram native Mahammil Ahammed citing the unscientific garbage treatment process in the plant.An action committee of local residents too had been formed against the plant and to put pressure on the local body to close it down taking into account pollution and public health issues.According to panchayat president Safeera Monnamkuni, the panchayat was ready to introduce any new facility at the plant taking into account public concern about various issues. “However, we would not be able to think of the closure of the plant on any circumstance as it had been functioning successfully to address the local garbage treatment needs. We will try to address the issues pointed out by the KSPCB after convening a panchayat meeting,” she added.
