The Bar Council of India has issued a show-cause notice to Delhi University’s Faculty of Law, asking it to explain the “illegalities” in its functioning, including more than permissible student strength, lack of infrastructure and faculty.In an unprecedented move, the BCI — the apex regulatory body for legal education and legal profession in India — had in 2014 decided to derecognise DU’s law course after it failed to seek timely extension of affiliation of its three centres — the Campus Law Centre, Law Centre-I and Law Centre-II.However, it was granted a provisional extension of affiliation for the 2014-15 session after DU proposed to shift to a new building, which it claimed “had adequate space” for the faculty to run properly.The show-cause notice comes after a fresh inspection by a BCI panel, headed by former Chief Justice of Patna High Court L. Narasimha Reddy, which has observed that besides fresh violations, the illegalities earlier highlighted remain unattended.
