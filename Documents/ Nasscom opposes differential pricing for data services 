The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said on Monday that all data tariff plans should ensure unfettered right of choice for the consumer and telecom carriers or their partners should not have a say in what content can be offered at “favourable rate”.The IT industry body, however, said the Telecom Regulator Authority of India (TRAI) should have powers to approve differential pricing for data services considered to be in public interest. Nasscom reiterated its opposition to platforms such as Airtel Zero and Free Basics, saying these violate the principles of net neutrality. Nasscom President R. Chandrashekhar said: “We strongly oppose any model where telecom services providers [TSPs] or their partners have a say or discretion in choosing content that is made available at favourable rates, speed etc.”TRAI has issued a consultation paper, on differential pricing for data services, for which the last date for submitting comments is January 7. The consultation paper raises issues related to zero-rating tariff models — a practice wherein service providers offer free data to users for select applications and websites.Nasscom has also proposed that a suitable oversight mechanism should be put in a place to check that the TSPs continue to abide by the principles of net neutrality.It has recommended establishing an independent not-for-profit entity with an independent board, which would own and manage proposed differential pricing programs.Mechanism to ensure net neutrality norms soughtThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a consultation paper on differential pricing for data services for which the last date for submitting comments is January 7.

In addition, Nasscom has also proposed that a suitable oversight mechanism should be put in a place to check that the TSPs continue to abide by the principles of net neutrality.It has recommended establishing an independent not-for-profit entity with an independent board, which would own and manage proposed differential pricing programs.“Differential pricing should not become a tool that facilitates market dominance or enables anti-competitive behaviour by either TSP or platform provider. It should not offer direct or indirect commercial benefit including leveraging the value of customer data generated in the process. Further it should not offer lower prices for own or partner content/ service,” Nasscom Internet Council Chairman Sanjiv Bikhchandani said.
