Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president Kummanam Rajasekharan has dared the CPI(M) to project a woman candidate for the Chief Minister’s post in the Assembly elections.Referring to CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat’s observation at the women’s parliament held in Kochi for creating a women-friendly Kerala, Mr. Rajasekharan said if it was a sincere view, the party should project a woman for heading the State.He also referred to earlier instances when K.R. Gouri and the late Susheela Gopalan were projected as Chief Ministerial candidates and then denied a chance. The CPI(M) which argues for women tend to ignore them on getting a chance. On getting a majority, will the party have a woman Chief Minister, he asked.KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran’s statement that RSS and CPI(M) activists should lay down arms and also that both had the same role in violence was aimed at whitewashing the CPI(M), he said.Mr. Rajasekharan accused the CPI(M) of sowing the seeds of violence in the State. The two fronts which had been governing the State in turns had not made any crucial step to expedite development and were involved in malicious campaign against each other.He dares the party to project a woman candidate for CM’s post.
