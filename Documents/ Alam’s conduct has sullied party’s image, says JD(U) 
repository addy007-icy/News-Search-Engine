The JD(U) has suspended Sarfaraj Alam because his conduct sullied its image, party Bihar president Basistha Narayan Singh said on Saturday.He was speaking to journalists after a meeting of top leaders, including party president Sharad Yadav, at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence here.Sarfaraj Alam, son of RJD MP Mohd. Taslimuddin, is the JD(U) MLA from Jokihat in Araria district.On January 18, an FIR was filed against him for “misbehaving with and molesting a couple” travelling on the Rajdhani Express from Dibrugarh to New Delhi.Indrapal Singh Bedi and his wife had lodged a complaint against him with the Railway Police.However, the MLA denied the charges and said he was not even travelling on the train that day. But the police gathered sufficient evidence and summoned him for questioning on Saturday evening. Mr. Alam complied with the summons.Earlier in the day, Mr. Nitish Kumar hinted at action against the MLA. “Nobody is above the law,” he said.He said Mr. Alam contacted his office on January 18 and he was given time to meet him on January 19 but he did not turn up. “Then I realised there was something fishy.”Asked about another controversial party MLA from Rupauli, Bima Bharti, and the party MP from Purnea, Santosh Kushwaha, who had allegedly helped gangster Awadhesh Mandal (Ms. Bharti’s husband) flee from police custody at the Maranga police station in Purnea recently, Mr. Singh said: “Nobody will be spared… Once the administrative report on their role comes in, the party will act against them if they are found guilty.”
