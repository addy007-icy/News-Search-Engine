The Delhi Police may be making optimum use of digital technology for hassle-free registration of complaints, but they are struggling without sufficient buildings to operate from.Of the 184 police stations in Delhi, more than one-third operate from temporary structures like tents and porta cabins, rented premises, under-construction buildings, police posts and the premises of other police stations. Only 115 of them function from regular buildings.The situation is such that even a Special Cell police station and the recently-inaugurated South Avenue and North Avenue stations in Lutyens’ Delhi operate from makeshift structures. Of the 19 police stations operating from temporary structures, most are located in the far-flung areas like Badarpur, Burari and Kapashera or non-VIP areas like Jamia Nagar, Preet Vihar and Sarai Rohilla.In a dozen cases, police posts serve as police stations. Prominent among these are the police stations in Saket, Uttam Nagar and Pandav Nagar. In fact, the Delhi Police’s elite Crime Branch police station too functions from a police post.Some of these police posts are so small that the police are forced to park impounded vehicles on road outside the premises. The shortage of space also often throws up privacy issues for women personnel and resting space for all of them.Since there is no immediate solution to the problem, the police have also resorted to taking buildings on rent and converting them into police stations. The rent of some of these police stations is in excess of Rs.1 lakh per month.A senior police officer said the cumulative rents paid for some of these buildings are enough to purchase a land and build a police station. The building out of which the domestic airport police station operates from is one among 14 such cases.The lack of buildings is evident from the fact that there are four police-owned buildings, divided to accommodate two police stations each. Three of such buildings are concentrated in South Delhi alone.Relatively fortunate are 20 other police stations, which are under-construction but still are being used. At best, they would be completed by the end of 2017.“Efforts are being made to complete the construction work of these buildings during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-17),” said a senior police officer in-charge of planning and implementation.Of the 184 police stations in Delhi, more than one-third operate from temporary structures like tents and porta cabins
