When the victim was guiding the duo, he allegedly attempted to snatch away three gold chains Lalitha was wearing. The victim, in a bid to resist his attempt, held on to the chains. However, the miscreant managed to make away with parts of two gold chains weighing 15 grams. By the time Lalitha called for help, the duo managed to flee the spot. She rushed to the police station and filed a complaint. The Yelahanka police have obtained CCTV footages from a near-by vehicle showroom.
