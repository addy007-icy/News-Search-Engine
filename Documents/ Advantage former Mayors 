Young and affable, he was the face of the city as its First Citizen for three years. Elected corporator from Ahmednagar division in the last Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections, Mohammad Majid Hussain of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) went on to don the Mayoral robes and head the civic body.In the fray from Mehdipatnam division in this round of the GHMC elections, Mr. Hussain has hit the campaign trail with a door-to-door campaign, and exudes confidence of winning in a comfortable manner.sGiven the high visibility that he had as Mayor for three years, he need not introduce or canvass much, as residents mob him and greet him as ‘Mayor saab’.“I am focussing more on personal interaction with the voters and hence going door-to-door. Mehdipatnam has lots of apartments and interactive group meeting with the residents are also being organised,” he says. Has being a Mayor been an advantage? “Sure, that identity is coming handy in the campaign,” Majid Hussain concedes.The GHMC in the last five years had grown and even its revenues rose considerably. “We have shown positive growth and MIM is the party which goes to the electorate with results,” he says, adding, “the citizens have lots of aspirations from us and every effort will be made to fulfil them.” After the polls, if there is going to be an MIM Mayor, will he be the one? “My party decides such things. I deliver responsibilities that are assigned to me,” says Mr. Hussain.
