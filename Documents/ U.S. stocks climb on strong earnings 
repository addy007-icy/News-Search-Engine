Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday morning, driven by strong earnings reports and recovering oil prices, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting and Apple’s results.Crude prices steadied above $30 a barrel on hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would come together to tackle a massive supply glut.Investors are still reeling from a turbulent start to the year, which saw Wall Street post its worst-ever start to a new year. A recovery late last week was largely wiped out on Monday as a fall in energy and materials stocks pulled indexes lower.“It’s going to go back and forth, and it looks like it's going to depend on what the price of oil does today,” said Matthew Tuttle, Chief Executive, Tuttle Tactical Management in Greenwich, Connecticut.“Expect more of the usual — lots of volatility — and it will be interesting to see if the bulls rally this thing or the bears try to sell it off,” Mr. Tuttle said, adding that the Fed would be a wild card.While the Fed is not expected to move on interest rates at its two-day meeting this week, investors will parse the commentary to gauge the impact of the recent global turmoil on the central bank’s outlook.
