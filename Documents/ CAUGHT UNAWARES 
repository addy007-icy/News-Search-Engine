A 14-year-old boy, Prasad, was severely hurt when a country-made bomb he picked up, presuming it to be a ball, exploded in his hands, at Adireddipalle village of Mydukur mandal in Kadapa district on Monday afternoon. “Prasad, who was grazing cattle, came across a ball-like object on the ground and picked it up, little realising it was a bomb. The boy lost fingers on his left hand in the blast,” police said. He was immediately shifted to the Government Hospital at Mydukur. Meanwhile, police searched the area and diffused two live bombs. They also registered a case and are investigating.
