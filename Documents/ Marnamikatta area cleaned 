A volunteer had to operate an earth mover for nearly two hours to clear construction waste dumped near a newly constructed apartment and other pockets in Marnamikatta area. A few volunteers climbed over an old public toilet, cleared the weeds grown on its roof. They cleared the waste dumped near the toilet building and painted the building to give it a new look.These were part of the 35th week of the Swachh Mangaluru campaign taken up under the auspices of Ramakrishna Mission here on Sunday. Students from different schools and colleges took part in the campaign.The start of Sunday’s drive was a little subdued with the news that the Union Minister for Water Resources Uma Bharati was not taking part in the campaign. Ms. Bharati was supposed to come in a train to the city on Sunday and attend the function to mark the end of the 35th week cleaning programme before proceeding to Udupi for the Paryaya celebrations.Because of the delay in the train, she cancelled the Mangaluru visit and got down at Udupi.Volunteers first took up the work of restoring the partly damaged circle in Marnamikatta. While one group took up cleaning of the road stretch between Marnamikatta Circle and Nandigudda Circle, another group cleared weeds and other waste on the stretch between Marnamikatta Circle and Morgan’s Gate. The third group of volunteers cleared waste on the road stretch between the Circle and Jeppu Market.
