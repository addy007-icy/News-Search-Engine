Dismissing the bail plea of the ink attacker, Bhawna Arora, a Delhi court on Tuesday remanded her to 14-day judicial custody.Arora had allegedly thrown ink at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal when he was speaking at the Chhatrasal Stadium last Sunday to celebrate the ‘success’ of the odd-even scheme.Counsel for the accused had sought bail submitting that the woman was not a previous convict and she had nothing to do with the commission of the alleged offence.Investigation into the allegations against her had already been completed. Being a woman, the accused was entitled to bail as per the provisions of Section 437 Cr.P.C, counsel for Ms. Bhawna further argued.Opposing the bail application, Assistant Public Prosecutor in the case submitted that the assault was not only on the Chief Minister but also on democracy.“After hearing both the sides and considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, this court is of the view that the offences, as alleged in the present case, are grievous and serious in nature and therefore, I am not inclined to grant bail to applicant/accused. Accordingly, bail application is disposed of as dismissed,’’ Mr. Kumar said rejecting her bail plea.“As the accused with the pre-meditated intention tried to insult and assault a public servant, who is Chief Minister of Delhi before the public gathering and this act of the accused in itself shows that the same was committed with due intention and planning and just to malign the reputation of the duly democratically elected head of State, which in itself is a serious act,’’ the Magistrate observed.“Further, the investigation of the present case is at the preliminary stage and the possibility of conspiracy of other persons cannot be ruled out.“Further, the behaviour and nature of the act done by the accused also does not entitle her to the bail,’’ the Magistrate further observed.
