: Cochin Port Trust (CPT) has decided to lease out 4.4 acres of port land between the Thoppumpady BOT Bridge and the old Harbour Bridge to develop tourism-related facilities.The lease will be for a period of one year, Port Trust sources said.The notice inviting tenders for the project is expected to be issued in tandem with the invitation to competent parties to develop the walkway lying south of the BOT Bridge along the waterfront.Rent at commercial rate for the entire land will be payable upfront.The successful bidder will be responsible maintaining the area in a neat and tidy manner.The developer can introduce any tourism activity, including water sports and boating.The successful bidder may also display advertisements in the area.The area will be cleaned by the Port and provided with barbed wire fencing and the developer may also collect entrance fee.The area can have restaurants and tourism-focused shops/stalls subject to CRZ restrictions, Port Trust sources added.The Port Trust will also invite competent parties through a tender to set up water sports and speed boating facilities from the water front along the Fort Kochi-Madura National Highway, lying south of the Thoppumpady BOT bridge.K.V. Thomas, MP, said the initial project for beautification of the walkway was based on a master plan prepared by an architect in the city and envisaged an expenditure of Rs.12 crore.However, a smaller project was initiated later and the present, unused walkway was built.However, it had fallen into disuse and lorry parking is rampant in the area, he said.The project was proposed with the State government pitching in Rs.50 lakh.Permission has also been sought from the National Highways Authority of India to build the new tourist amenities.The present plan is to build a walkway between the BOT bridge and the Alexander Parambithara bridge.Mr. K. V. Thomas said the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) planned to maintain the old Venduruthy bridge and to build facilities for angling since the spot was frequented by anglers in the city.
