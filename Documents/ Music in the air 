With a wide array of songs that ranged from melodious tracks to fast numbers, the Ganamela appealed to people of all age groups.But, the Ganamela competition for high school students had begun on a disappointing note on Sunday. Despite being scheduled to be held at the Poojappura grounds at 12 p.m., the competition was shifted to the venue at Holy Angels HSS and postponed by four hours, much to the chagrin of students and teachers from other districts who waited for long at the original venue.However, things took a positive turn once the competition got under way. There was no dearth in the variety of songs presented by the performers. While almost all garnered loud cheers, some even led spectators to sing along.According to Khadeeja Kunhippuram, music teacher of HMY Higher Secondary School in Manjeri, the competing teams were allowed to select songs of their choice to perform within the maximum allotted time-limit of 10 minutes.“We make it a point to mix and match songs that enable us to exploit the talent of the performers to the hilt,” she said.While the number of performers in each team has been restricted to seven, there is no limit on the number of instruments that can be used. The crowd, mostly comprising youngsters, had a ball at the venue.
