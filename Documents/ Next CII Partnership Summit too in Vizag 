Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday announced that the next CII Partnership Summit would be hosted in Visakhapatnam.After consulting Union Minister for Commerce Nirmala Sitharaman, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee and president Sumit Mazumder, Mr. Naidu said the second Partnership Summit in Andhra Pradesh post-bifurcation would be organised in Visakhapatnam only.
