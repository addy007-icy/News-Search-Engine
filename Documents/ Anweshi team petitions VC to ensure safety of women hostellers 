: The Kozhikode-based Anweshi Women’s Counselling Centre has petitioned the new Vice-Chancellor of Calicut University K.Mohammed Basheer and the Registrar T.A.Abdul Majeed to take necessary measures to ensure the safety of hostellers at the Women’s Hostel on the Calicut University campus at Thenhipalam.A fact-finding team of Anweshi, consisting of writer Sara Joseph and Anweshi president K. Ajitha, had visited the campus on January 12 for a hearing following complaints by a few students.Sixteen students shared their experiences with the team. They complained about lack of facilities at the hostel, including insufficient number of toilets, and the alleged sexual harassment by miscreants.The students said there were no window panes in many rooms, causing a sense of insecurity among them. The rooms open to the road behind the hostel from where one gets a clear view of the rooms. They complained about the deplorable condition of toilets in the hostel.They said miscreants often lingered around the hostel, some engaged in exhibitionism.They complained that a few students of the Physical Education Department made suggestive comments when the girls passed by.The students said they had reported a number of cases to the Registrar, and had even forwarded it to the local police. But, no action had been taken yet. On the other hand, girl students have been told not to ‘wander’ outside the hostel after 8 p.m., which is difficult for research scholars and postgraduates who have to work in libraries and laboratories till late.The thick foliage around the campus had been removed recently as part of campus beautification. But the foliage behind the women’s hostel had not been cleared, the students pointed out.The VC promised to take action on cases that needed immediate attention. He also consented to set up a democratic system that would enable the students to communicate with the Vice- Chancellor freely.The Internal Complaints Committee of the University too had submitted a report of a similar nature to the VC.
