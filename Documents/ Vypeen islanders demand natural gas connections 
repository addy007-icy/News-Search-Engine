This time it is not water or a bridge link to Ernakulam that Vypeen islanders are demanding. They are demanding domestic natural gas connections under the city gas project being inaugurated on January 26.T. R. Kailasan, member of the Elamkunnappuzha panchayat from Vypeen said that people were demanding city gas connections and there is no one who is not wanting it. He feels that Vypeen islanders should have got the first connections.The demand by the islanders comes in contrast to a small group of people in Kalamassery municipality opposing piped natural gas connections under the city gas project. Geetha Ajit, secretary of Federation of Residents Murikkumpadam, says that Vypeen islanders had been overlooked. The LNG terminal is here on the island and residents of the island should have been given some preference, she said.“We have been neglected once again by the government,” said chairman of Goshree Action Council Majnu Komath, who led a 16-year protest action demanding the Goshree bridges. His claim is that natural gas is being imported via Vypeen and the trunk pipeline passes through the island. The islanders should, therefore have been the first to get the connections, he claimed.Meanwhile, sources said that though Indian Oil-Adani Gas Private Limited has been given a time-specific target for covering Ernakulam district, the company is not bound to prioritise connections.It is learnt that builders in the district are keen to have piped natural gas connections at their property sites as an added attraction for their potential clients even as work on laying steel pipes that will run through the entire district is fast progressing. It is learnt that more than 200 domestic connections will be provided along with the inaugural six connections at the Ernakulam Medical College in Kalamassery.
