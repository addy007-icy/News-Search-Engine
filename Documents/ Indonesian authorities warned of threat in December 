The attacks on Thursday in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta were not a complete surprise to Indonesian authorities, who were warned in December of a credible threat.The government deployed 1,50,000 security personnel to safeguard churches, airports and other public places across the country, and made a series of pre-emptive arrests.No one has claimed responsibility for Thursdayâ€™s bomb attacks.The authorities have been keenly aware of the danger of terrorism since bombings in 2002 on the resort island of Bali that killed more than 200 people, more than half of them foreign tourists.The Bali bombings were attributed to Jemaah Islamiyah, an al-Qaeda-linked Southeast Asian group.
