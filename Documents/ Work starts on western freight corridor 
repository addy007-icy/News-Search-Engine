The Express Freight Consortium led by Mitsui & Co Ltd.of Japan and comprising TATA Projects and IRCON International Ltd has announced commencing work on a section of the western dedicated freight corridor (DFC), planned to connect Delhi and Mumbai.The consortium has bagged the contract to build 320 km of the dedicated rail link at a cost of Rs 4,328 crore. The consortium plans to complete the work in 48 months using latest technology of automated track laying machines. The rails to be used in the project will be of 250-metre long and the axle load of the track will be 32.5 tonnes, at par with tracks in Japan, compared to the current Indian rail tracks of 25-tonne axle load.The project will be executed in two phases: between Vaitarana and Sachin (186 km) and between Sachin and Vadodara (134 km).The DFC, being implemented by the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd (DFCCIL), involves construction of two corridors: the eastern dedicated freight corridor from Ludhiana to Dankuni, and the western dedicated freight corridor from Dadri to Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Mumbai.
