Renovated cultural centre is going to be a boon for the students of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar University. The Kalapraganam was named after freedom fighter Sardar Gouthu Latchanna. The centre was formally inaugurated by Etcherla MLA Kala Venkata Rao. University Vice-Chancellor H.Lajapathi Rai said that the auditoriums and cultural centres would help students to have interaction and display their talent in extra-curricular activities. Palasa MLA G. Shivaji donated Rs.1.5 lakh to the university for organising endowment lectures to take forward the ideology of his father Latchanna. Several leaders of ruling party and officials of the university participated in the programme.
