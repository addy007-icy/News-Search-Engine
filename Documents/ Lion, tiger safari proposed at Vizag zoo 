Imagine how it would be if you get am opportunity to enjoy lion and tiger safari along with a visit to a marine land complex housing some endangered marine species!All this will be a reality with proposals made for execution under the World Bank-funded rebuilding and improving facilities at the Huhdud-devastated Indira Gandhi Zoological Park here.While the lion and tiger safari is proposed at the neighbouring Animal Rescue Centre (ARC), deer safari will be revived in the zoo. The amount sanctioned for zoo will also be spent for improvement of the ARC.Dugong, medium sized mammals also called sea cows, Olive Ridley turtles and different species of marine fish will be kept in separate cubicles in the marine land complex. The complex was originally planned to be developed as dolphinarium. It was subsequently dropped due to fund crunch and doubts over its viability.While zoo has 94 species and 688 inmates including two tigers, two lions, five panthers, two cheetah, five white tigers, two jaguars, two hippo, two giraffes and 28 wild dogs, the ARC – a place for decent retired life for animals subjected to torture in circus parties, is home to 17 lions and seven tigers.$6 million sanctionedThe World Bank has already sanctioned $6 million for the zoo. The proposals also include rebuilding enclosures, laying new roads, developing drinking water and surveillance network with amenities for visitors, kiosks with touch screen, audio-visual presentations and a well-equipped library to encourage research on wildlife and nature.“We also want to improve veterinary services by providing preventive medicine – which is not available now. Quarantine facility is also lacking. All this will make our zoo spread over 625 acres a world-class ecological park,” Zoo Curator B. Vijay Kumar told The Hindu . World Bank team leader Deepak Singh, during his recent visit, had declared that if required they would sanction more funds to make the zoo and the adjacent Kambalakonda Nature Park into world-class eco parks.
