Observing that ‘the sentence of imprisonment (15 days in jail) imposed upon the appellant (accused) is, in no way, harsh or unwarranted, a Sessions court here has reduced his sentence to five days of imprisonment’.The accused, Niraj Kumar, had filed an appeal against his 15 days imprisonment by a Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) court. He had pleaded guilty to the charges before the MM court.The man was found driving a car in a drunken state around 11 at night on December 11 last year. His Breath Analysis Report revealed that the alcohol content in his blood was 201.5 mg per 100 ml of blood. The permissible limit is 30mg per 100 ml of blood.“It is, therefore, evident, that the appellant was driving the vehicle i.e. a car in a heavily drunken state. The menace of drunken driving has assumed alarming proportions and one of the ways to curb it is by imposing severe sentence on such offenders. In the instant case, there would have certainly been a horrible tragedy, if the appellant was not stopped by the traffic police,” Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat observed.“Therefore, I am of the opinion that the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the appellant is, in no way, harsh or unwarranted. However, having regard to the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, the period of sentence of imprisonment is reduced from fifteen days to five days,” Mr. Bhat said.Urging the court to set aside the sentence, counsel for the accused had argued that the imprisonment of the appellant, as ordered by the MM would not serve any purpose at all as the sentence of fine imposed upon him has shown the desired result.The accused had deposited the fine amount, Rs.1,000, imposed upon him by the MM court before filing the appeal.
