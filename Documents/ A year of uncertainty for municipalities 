: The year before elections are held is always an action-packed one and 2016 promises to be that and more for the Capital’s municipal corporations. With polls scheduled for early 2017, the three corporations will be at the centre of a political battle, which may have already begun.According to sources in the corporations, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has embarked on a campaign to expose the weaknesses of the BJP, which has ruled the civic bodies since 2007.The AAP, which was founded in 2012, is likely to contest the municipal polls for the first time.With the AAP government setting up a committee to look into the functioning of the corporations last week, officials say the government could recommend the dissolution of the civic bodies.The committee has been tasked with conducting a performance audit of the corporations to see if they have fulfilled their obligatory duties.The government’s action comes after repeated strikes by corporations’ staff, who have not been paid for months as the civic bodies go through a financial crisis.“The conditions right now point towards the government recommending superseding the corporations,” said a senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official.Under Section-490 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, only the Centre can supersede a civic body if it “defaults in the performance of the duties…or exceeds or abuses its powers”.The AAP government has already made its stand clear vis-à-vis municipal polls, telling the High Court it would be willing to advance the elections to September or October this year. That is unlikely to happen, but sources say the government could still recommend the dissolution of the corporations.The ruling-BJP has accused the AAP government of pushing it towards a financial crisis.“The government is bleeding the corporations dry for its own political gain. They are capable of unconstitutional actions, but we are ready to fight it [dissolution],” said Ashish Sood, the Leader of the House in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.Mr. Sood added that the government had already prepared its audit report, which would try to show that the corporations had failed in discharging their duties.The Opposition Congress, however, has been accusing the BJP of financial mismanagement for a year now, as the budgetary deficit has grown.The Leader of the Opposition in the SDMC, Farhad Suri, said: “The BJP dispensation is incompetent and corrupt. The Delhi government has shown how petty it is in the past year so it will recommend superseding the corporations. But that will be against the interest of democracy.”
