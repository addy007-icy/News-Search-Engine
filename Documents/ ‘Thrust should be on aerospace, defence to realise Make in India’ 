An expert panel will recommend creating centres of excellences in universities to expose young minds to latest research besides easing opportunities for students to work as interns in the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) or Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratories.It has also stressed the need for including defence and aerospace technologies in the engineering curricula to realise the Make in India initiative. This was stated at a panel discussion on ‘Skill set development in engineering manufacture for Make in India’ held as part of the Indian Science Congress here on Thursday.The panellists, led by the former DRDO chief, V.K. Aatre, opined that introducing defence- and aerospace industry-related courses in institutions of higher learning and greater academia-industry interaction in the sector were imperative because the two fields encompass the entire gamut of science and technology and would shore up other sectors as well.In his inaugural address, Mr. Aatre said a large country’s growth cannot hinge on mere service sector, it had to do hardcore engineering, and the expert panel suggested developing the ecosystem — from supply of raw materials to research and development support, besides manufacturing and marketing.‘Course needed’Col. H.S. Shankar (retd) noted the absence of formal course in any of the engineering colleges or even the IITs to orient the graduates to the skills required for space and defence industries.He suggested that a college or a university could start credit course on defence equipment or design which could be expanded to full-fledged departments or even colleges later.G. Raj Narayan, who worked in various capacities in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. before turning into an entrepreneur, said Make in India should not be confused with manufacture in India which creates low-end jobs, but should translate into conceptualising, designing and producing in India.A large country’s growth cannot hinge on mere service sector, it has to do hardcore engineering.V.K.
