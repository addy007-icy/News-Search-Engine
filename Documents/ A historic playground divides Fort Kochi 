: The Fort Kochi Parade Ground, steeped in history, is seeing people in the township gather on both sides of a divide over whether to build a drainage system around it to prevent water-logging during the rainy months.The State unit of National Alliance of People’s Movement has written to the director of archaeology to hold a site inspection immediately as the remnants of what is believed to be a Portuguese armoury was discovered while digging for the drainage system.State convenor of NAPM V.D. Majeendran said in the letter that the drainage system was being laid by the department of tourism in consultation with State-owned consultancy Kitco. The letter alleged that those working on the drainage system had not informed the authorities concerned about the finds close to the playground.Veteran football and hockey coach and Fort Kochi resident Rufus D’Souza said that the drainage system would prevent water logging during rains as the level would be raised. He said that the Revenue Department authorities had visited the ground on Friday to take stock of the situation when he pointed out to heritage buildings being reconstructed in the vicinity. “Why there is opposition only to building the drainage system,” he asked the authorities, he said.Mr. Majeendran said that NIPM was not opposed to people using the playground, which has been the haunt for sports enthusiasts from in and around Ernakulam. However, the historic importance of the place should be kept in mind, he said.Member of the Corporation Council from Fort Kochi Shyni Mathew, who is also the Town Planning Standing Committee chairman, said that there was no fresh construction involved and she expected the Archaeological Survey of India to carry out the drainage system work under the prescribed norms.She also said that there were false reports that some construction activity would be undertaken at the playground.
