The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum at Nagercoil has directed the University of Madras to pay a compensation of Rs. 5,000 to one of its old student who had complained that he was not issued certificate for B.Sc. degree he had completed in 1965.K. Ratnasamy of Agastheesvaram in Kanyakumari had studied B.Sc. at St. John’s College in Palayamkottai during 1963-65 and completed the course in May 1965. Since he needed the certificate in connection with a visit to the U.S., he remitted a fee of Rs. 900 in May 2013 seeking the certificate.As the two letters he wrote and his visits to the university went in vain, he moved the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Kanyakumari seeking a direction for issuance of the certificate and compensation for the mental agony he underwent. Despite notices sent to the university officials, it did not choose to appear before the forum and remained ex parte.Since the averments of the complainant were not denied by the university officials, the forum comprising R. Narayanasamy and S. Sivalingam said in a recent order that the claim was proved and observed, “Accordingly the attitude of the opposite parties has caused deficiency in service.”‘Issue certificate’The forum directed the Madras University authorities to issue the certificate to the complainant and pay compensation of Rs. 5,000 for mental agony suffered by complainant and further pay a cost of Rs. 1,000 of this complaint to the complainant within one month from the date of this order.
