Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday hailed the security forces for thwarting the attack by a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists at an Air Force base here and urged Centre to “effectively seal” the border to curb the menace of cross-border terrorism.The united effort of the State and Central security agencies have once again foiled the nefarious designs of the anti-national forces, he said.“The entire country salutes these brave hearts that are ever ready to combat any such move,”Mr. Badal said.He said that it was the high time that Centre take a call on cross-border terrorism by “effectively sealing” the border.In a pre-dawn attack, a group of heavily-armed Pakistani terrorists, struck at an Air Force base here in Punjab, leading to a fierce gun-battle in which three security personnel were killed along with four attackers.Interacting with the people at the residence of Ikagar Singh who was killed by the terrorists on Thursday night here, the CM said that State government was fully committed to preserve the peace and communal harmony in Punjab and no one would be allowed to disturb it at any cost.“Ikagar Singh was a national martyr, who laid his life for the country,” Mr. Badal said.The Chief Minister announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh for the Ikagar’s family besides government job for his wife.The State government would also give old age pension to parents of Ikagar, he added.On Thursday night, 4-5 suspected Pakistani terrorists in army uniform had abducted and thrashed a Superintendent of Police and his two associates before dumping them some distance away and speeding away in his vehicle.The body of Ikagar Singh was found near the SP’s abandoned vehicle at a place 35 km from Pathankot.It is believed that the men, who abducted the SP and two others, first snatched Ikagar’s Innova who was on his way back from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir. They slit his throat and dumped his body near the bridge before fleeing.Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Amarinder Singh also condemned the terror attack on the Air Force base, saying it was a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to sabotage the peace process, which must not be allowed to be happen.Noting that the attack took place only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lahore visit, Capt. Singh hoped that it was not a repeat of what happened after then Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee’s Lahore bus journey. The Kargil war took place soon after Mr. Vajpayee’s visit.“It is a clear attempt by rogue elements in Pakistan to subvert and sabotage the peace process between the two countries (India and Pakistan) which must not be allowed at any cost”, the Congress Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha said here.“It is the responsibility of the Pakistan government to identify such elements and deal with them with a firm hand,” he said.He said while the peace process should continue, India at the same time must not lower its guard.“We can’t allow our people, soldiers and police personnel to be killed by the militants from across the border and Pakistan needs to own up responsibility and deal with such elements firmly”, he said, adding, they know where the problem lies and they must resolve it.Capt Amarinder also saluted the martyrs for their bravery.“Even as we grieve your loss, the entire nation is proud of you for the exemplary valour and courage you have shown by killing the terrorists and the nation will always remember your great sacrifice”, he said.-PTI
