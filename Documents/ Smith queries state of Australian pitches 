Australia cricket captain Steve Smith chided curators on Friday, saying pitches for his team’s home series against New Zealand, the West Indies and India have been too batting-friendly.Smith set aside self-interest he has scored more than 1,400 runs in all forms of cricket since December to suggest grounds staff at the WACA in Perth and the Gabba in Brisbane should do their best to restore traditional pace and bounce.In Australia’s six test matches against New Zealand and the West Indies this summer, teams surpassed 500 five times and four limited-overs internationals against India have produced more than 2,500 runs.Smith said he was disappointed with pitches at the WACA and Gabba and “it’d be great if that (pace and bounce) was brought back. I think that’ll make it a little bit more even between bat and ball.”
