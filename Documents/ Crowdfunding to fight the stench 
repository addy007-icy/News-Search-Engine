They have sent petitions. They have protested. But trouble doesn’t seem to end for the residents of Kudlu, Hosapalya, Harlur, Somasundarapalya and Parangipalya.The Karnataka Compost Development Corporation (KCDC) waste processing unit continues to emanate stench, much to the chagrin of the residents living in these areas.The residents of these areas have now decided to take the legal route, and for this, they are set to begin a fund-collection drive.On Sunday, the core group of 25 residents and campaigners met to discuss the roadmap for the same. Anis Padela, a techie and chief campaigner, told The Hindu that the fight was for the residents’ “fundamental #RightToBreathe” .To begin with, the residents of the five affected areas have come together to register the KHHSP Residents’ Welfare Association.Mr. Padela said the fund-collection drive would begin soon and the money would be used for legal representation, testing of air and water quality, and other administrative expenses.“After the residents protested, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike reduced the quantum of waste being sent to the KCDC unit for processing to 60 tonnes. However, this has not solved our problem," he said,The stench from the composting unit continues to trouble the residents of the locality, he said.Mr. Padela further sought to know if the BBMP was actually causing counter pollution, instead of solving the garbage problem, by converting the new waste processing units into temporary landfills.Questioning whether the BBMP had adequate infrastructure in place to solve the city’s garbage menace, Mr. Padela blamed the civic body for violating the buffer zone regulation as prescribed under the Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000.“As per rules, the buffer zone should be 250 metres (from such a unit). This has been violated … Residents in a 2-km radius of this particular waste processing unit are suffering as the plant raises a stink,” he added.Residents in a 2-km radius of the processing unit are suffering as the plant raises a stink.Anis Padela,techie
