Seeking to challenge the dominance of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), a confederation representing thousands of officers of 20 Civil Services, including Indian Police Service, has sought fair representation on an empowered committee that will examine the Seventh Central Pay Commission recommendations.In a memorandum submitted to Cabinet Secretary P.K. Sinha and Expenditure Secretary Ratan P. Watal recently, it demanded that the representation of any one service be restricted to 25 per cent of the total strength of the committee.On January 13, the Union Cabinet gave its approval for setting up an empowered committee of Secretaries under the Cabinet Secretary to process the recommendations of the pay panel.The Confederation of Civil Services Association (COCSA) has highlighted the “apprehensions” shared by a “majority” of officers and requested for a fair representation to other services on committee, said senior IRS officer Jayant Misra, its convener.The COCSA had in December forwarded a memorandum and sought an appointment with the Cabinet Secretary to explain to him the “concern” of these officers.“We are still waiting for an opportunity to meet the Cabinet Secretary. We have submitted fresh memoranda dated January 19, 2016 to the Cabinet Secretary and also to the Expenditure Secretary, reiterating our demand that equitable representation be given to various services in all the bodies or committees etc. looking into or implementing the recommendations of the seventh CPC, so that there is no domination by any particular service,” Mr. Misra pointed out.
