Representatives of the Federation of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) Retired Employees Welfare Associations petitioned City Police Commissioner A. Amalraj, on Monday, seeking action against the Managing Director and Financial Advisor of that transport corporation for not giving them their rightful financial benefits.Convenor of the confederation K. Rajaram said that the petitioning in Coimbatore was part of the State-wide movement in which their members petitioned the Commissioner or Superintendent of Police, of all cities and districts. He said that 30,000 persons, who retired from 2010, had not received the financial benefits till date. Around 250 of them had already died without getting the benefits, he claimed.He said that during their service, the TNSTC deducted a portion of their salary for provident fund and deposited it in the TNSTC Employees Provident Fund Trust. This was not remitted properly over the last 10 years. He also said that leave surrender pay had not been disbursed from 2010 and gratuity from August 2012.“For some of them, the transport corporation has to pay about Rs. 15 lakh,” he said. Mr. Rajaram added that they had staged a series of protests, petitioned the Transport Minister, Secretary, Chief Minister and the Governor, but in vain. “So we have lodged complaints against TNSTC authorities and sought action against them under Section 405 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.The members said that the Police Commissioner assured them to inquire into allegations made by them and initiate appropriate action.
