Denizens campaigning against the closure of the Secunderabad Cantonment roads by the Army have alleged that important orders received from various wings of the Defence Ministry were not followed.Last week, members of OSCAR, a community working to get the closed cantonment roads opened, wrote to the Principal Director of Defence Estates (PDDE), Southern Command, stating that two letters dated January 9 and January 13, 2015 were ignored. These letters are part of a series of communications sent out following a Defence Ministry letter of January 7. The Ministry’s letter ordered the service chiefs to ensure that rule of law is not subverted when closing cantonment roads by the local military authorities.Members of OSCAR claim that subsequent letters ordered the PDDEs and the CEOs of cantonment boards, including Secunderabad Cantonment, to ensure compliance with the Ministry’s letters, but the CEO of SCB did not act on it.The Defence Ministry’s letter ordered the service chiefs to ensure that rule of law is not subverted when closing cantonment roads
