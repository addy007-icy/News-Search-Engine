The Telangana Adivasi Girijana Sangham (TAGS) on Sunday demanded proper implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 in the country. The organisation criticised the Union government for excluding lakhs of valid petitions from the scope of the FRA.The TAGS organised a public meeting at Utnoor, the headquarters of the agency in Adilabad district, which was attended by a large number of Adivasis from across the district. CPI(M) leaders Jitin Choudhry, who is the MP from Tripura, Bhadrachalam MLA Sunnam Rajaiah, who is State president of TAGS, and Midiam Bapu Rao, State convenor of the Adivasi Adhikar Rashtriya Manch, were among those who attended the meeting. Mr. Choudhry demanded an autonomous council for governing all tribal areas in the country. He also wanted strict implementation of the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act in the agency villages.The communist leaders pointed out the anomaly that a non-tribal in the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao government heads the Stateâ€™s Tribal Advisory Council, though it should have been headed by a tribal. Earlier, the Adivasis from the district took a rally in the town.
