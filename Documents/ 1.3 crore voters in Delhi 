Voters were given a month’s time to submit applications for any changes in their details in the roll or for enrolment.Apart from the assembly constituency of Burari, where special summary revision has been ordered due to technical reasons, rolls of the other 69 constituencies have now been finalised.Since the last rolls were finalised on January 5, 2015, the number of voters added to the list is 1,32,569. With the deletion of 11,761 voters from the list, the net increase in the electoral roll has been 1,20,808.A good change in the roll this time has been the increase in gender ratio by four points, compared to last year.The office of CEO had also carried out special camps for enrolment of homeless persons in October last year in each constituency, in which 678 forms for inclusion of name were received. After verification, 406 homeless persons have been added to the electoral roll, a statement from the CEO office said.With the number of voters in Delhi going up, the number of polling stations in Delhi have been increased from 11,763 to 13,124 and the number of polling locations have gone up from 2,530 to 2,620.
