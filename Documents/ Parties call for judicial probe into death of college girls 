Political party leaders, including VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan and BJP State president Tamilisai Soundarajan, have demanded a judicial inquiry into the death of college girls in Villupuram.While senior police officers refused to comment on the death of the girls, it is learnt that they have registered a case under IPC Sections 384 (extortion) and 306 (abetment to suicide) and provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment Act.In a complaint lodged with the Villupuram police, M Ezhumalai, father of Saranya of Avadi alleged that his daughter was murdered. “There was water in the well yet all the girls had head injuries. My daughter was among those who had deposed against the college during an enquiry by officials after the students submitted a complaint to the district administration last year. I fear mercenaries were hired to kill her,” he alleged in the complaint.
