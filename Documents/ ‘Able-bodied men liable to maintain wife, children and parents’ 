Every healthy and able-bodied man must be presumed to be possessing ‘sufficient means,’ irrespective of his income, to pay maintenance to his wife, children and parents, the Madras High Court Bench here has said.Justice M. Venugopal made the observation while dismissing a criminal revision case filed by a person challenging an order passed by Dindigul Chief Judicial Magistrate in 2014 directing him to pay Rs. 3,000 every month to his estranged wife.The judge said that the petitioner’s wife had actually failed to prove through sufficient and acceptable documentary and oral evidence that he owned valuable immovable properties besides earning Rs. 10,000 a month by lending money.“Even in the absence of necessary proof, as stated already, after marriage, it is the duty of the husband to provide shelter and maintenance to the wife.
