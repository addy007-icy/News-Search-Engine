Thanks to the vigilant railway staff, a major accident involving the Vijayawada â€“ Yeshwanthpur Express was averted on Wednesday morning. Station Master Lakshman received information that the track at the 442/50 km stone was out of place even as the train was fast approaching on the same track for its scheduled stop at Guntakal railway junction after having been given the green signal to chug onto Platform No. 4. Immediately, the Station Master shifted the platform to No. 3, thus avoiding a major tragedy.
