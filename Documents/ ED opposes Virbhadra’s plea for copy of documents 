The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday told Delhi High Court that the agency was opposed to providing Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh a copy of the money laundering case lodged against him.Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for ED, however, sought time from the court to get back on whether Mr Singh can be denied a copy of the case after Justice Ashutosh Kumar questioned whether someone can be divested of their legal right to have the documents.The Judge also said if the documents sought are not given to Mr Singh, the same can not be used against him during trial.The court also asked about the reasons for ED’s refusal to give the documents and said the agency will have to convince it about it.The CBI, represented by Additional Solicitor General P S Patwalia, told the court that it will provide a xerox copy of the documents seized from Mr Singh’s office and residence. He said that 40 per cent of the photocopying work is over.The agency, however, told the High Court that it had kept the documents with it on the direction of the trial court and, if Mr Singh required a copy, he should have approached the trial court.The High Court, thereafter, adjourned the matter to January 7, saying it will pass orders on that date on the plea of Mr Singh. The ED has filed a case against Mr Singh under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Mr Singh, in his plea, has also sought a direction to CBI to provide him all the documents seized by the agency when it had raided his residence and office.On September 26 this year, CBI had conducted raids at 11 places including Mr Singh’s residences in Delhi and Himachal, on the day his daughter was getting married.He has also prayed that ED be restrained from taking any action against him for “non-compliance” of summons issued to him on November 16 in connection with the money laundering case. -- PTI
