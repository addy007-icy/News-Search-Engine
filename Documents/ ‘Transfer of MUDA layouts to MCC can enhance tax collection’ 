The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) could augment its property tax revenue collection significantly if the residential layouts developed by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) were handed over to it.As per the norms, the MUDA, on completing the development of the layouts, hands over the property to the MCC for maintenance. The MCC in turn collects property tax from the layouts for the services extended. As of now there are 80 new layouts – both private and MUDA-developed- which are awaiting transfer to the MCC. “If the new layouts are transferred to the MCC, it would yield the Corporation an additional Rs.15 crore by way of property tax,” according to Mysuru Urban Development Authority chairman K.R. Mohan Kumar.At present, the residents of these layouts pay a nominal tax to the MUDA but on transfer to the MCC would pay as per the rates under the SAS.The list of 80 layouts has been sent to the MCC officials and the engineers are in the process of inspecting them to ascertain if all infrastructure and civic amenities are in place. Besides, there are 60 other layouts with the Mysuru Urban Development Authority where civic works are nearing completion and could be transferred to the Mysuru City Corporation at a later date.At present, the residents of these layouts pay a nominal tax tothe MUDA
