The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is on an overdrive to collect property tax in a bid to shore up its finances to meet the revenue target. The Corporation, which has set a target of collecting Rs.110.43 crore by way of property tax for the financial year 2015-16, has so far collected Rs.76.83 crore (as on January 25) and is yet to realise Rs.33.20 crore.Though the MCC officials have cautioned property owners to pay up or face disconnection of services, it is unlikely that the local body will realise its target this year going by the previous records. Property tax is the single largest source of revenue for the local body, besides government grants. But, there is always a shortfall in meeting the target.There are 1,84,864 registered properties in the MCC limits of which 23,544 are revenue properties. The list of registered properties also includes 10,428 commercial properties and 12,663 vacant sites. It is reckoned that updating the property registry could result in an increase in the number of registered properties in the city coming under the tax net thus increasing the scope for collection. MCC Commissioner C.G. Betsurmath told The Hindu that the property registry was being updated and this could enhance the collectable tax in future. Though there are 1.84 lakh registered properties in the city, the GIS-based survey under the Urban Property Ownership Record (UPOR) project indicates that there 3,15,566 properties in the project area. This includes 42 villages around Mysuru which are outside the purview of the MCC. Discounting these villages, the number of villages that could be brought under the property tax net was huge, said Mr. Betsurmath.Though a sizeable number of properties are served by the MCC by way of providing drainage, water and streetlight to them, there is no corresponding revenue accruing from them as these properties are unofficially outside the tax net. As a fist step to realise its target, the MCC has identified major defaulters in each of its nine zones and was targeting them. “Many of them have not paid taxes since years and have arrears of up to Rs.10 lakh or more … they are being targeted,” the Commissioner said.There are a total of 1,38,229 residential units, 10,428 commercial units, 23,544 vacant plots, 110 kalyan mantaps, 22 theatres, 181 apartment complexes, 80 private hospitals, 45 government hospitals, 206 private schools, 111 government schools and 73 community halls within the jurisdiction of the MCC.
