The State government is learnt to have ignored a Public Service Commission (PSC) offer to conduct a time-bound recruitment drive to fill up about 1,500 vacancies in the universities.On entrusting the recruitment authority to the universities, the commission had offered to complete the process within six months by setting a specific deadline for issuing the notification, inviting applications, conducting the test and interview, preparing the list and issuing the advice to the candidates.Commission sources told The Hindu here that this focussed initiative would have provided additional job opportunities than what has been envisaged by the government at present. Now, the government has decided to select the candidates who have figured in the rank list prepared by the commission for recruiting Secretariat assistants. Had the government expedited the vacancy reporting procedures, a majority of the candidates in the list would have got placement much earlier itself.There are complaints that the decision to fill up the vacancies with identified beneficiaries from the existing list would give room for corrupt practices. For, the government as well as the candidates would be able to know in advance the prospects of getting placement from the existing list and that would lead to corruption and nepotism, sources said The legal sanctity of the decision too has become questionable. For, each rank list is prepared for filling up the vacancies arising in a particular department or agency and it should be used only for that specific purpose. A fresh rank list is mandatory for every new selection process. The latest decision seeks to bypass this norm. Whether it would stand legal scrutiny is a matter of contention. For, the Supreme Court had ruled against filling up vacancies from existing lists as it would deny chance for fresh talent, sources said. The commission’s offer was to replicate the system it has been following in the recruitment to the uniformed forces, wherein it would fix a clear target for completing the process and would attain it too. Employees of the commission too are understood to have agreed to cooperate with the proposal. But the government was insistent on drawing from the existing list itself, sources said.Govt. wants to draw from the existing list itself for the vacancies‘Getting placement from existing list could lead to corrupt practices’
