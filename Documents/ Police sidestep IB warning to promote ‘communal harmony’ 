The Intelligence Bureau (IB) may have issued repeated alerts in the days preceding the Republic Day celebrations, but Delhi’s North-East district police chose to sidestep its warning when they hoisted the national flag in the communally sensitive Khajuri Khas on January 26.Senior officers told The Hindu that they decided to go ahead with the Republic Day celebrations in the area, ignoring the IB warning, in order to “promote communal harmony” as they were “confident” of ensuring peaceful celebrations.“Around 500 persons across different religions attended the flag-hoisting ceremony. They were very enthusiastic and set an example for everyone in the area,” said Veenu Bansal, DCP (North-East).According to Sanjay Beniwal, Joint CP (Eastern Range), the IB had warned that Republic Day celebrations in Shri Ram Colony in Khajuri Khas had the potential of sparking off communal tensions.“The advice was not to hoist the national flag there,” Mr. Beniwal told The Hindu .Khajuri Khas has witnessed two incidents of communal tension in the last six months. One of those clashes was over sharing a local park — Ram Leela Ground in Shri Ram Colony — for religious celebrations.But that did not scare the district police when the Republic Day approached this time. It was a “conscious” decision and the police were “well-planned”.However, the police’s decision was not entirely unopposed. According to a senior officer, who organised Tuesday’s event, there were a few “mischievous elements” from both the religious groups who warned of trouble. “But the overwhelming majority of the residents supported us and said they would ensure no one indulged in mischief,” said the officer.The very park which was the bone of contention between the two religious groups was chosen for the ceremony.“Initially, the two communities stood in their own groups, but they all joined each other to sing the national anthem,” the officer said.Responding to the incident of “bypassing” the IB’s warning, a government official said that certain inputs had been shared with the Delhi Police, but it was for the police to take the final call since they know the ground situation and their strengths.The police said their “confidence” came from a similar exercise they had conducted within days after the communal tension in Shri Ram Colony in July.“To re-establish the bond of trust, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had held its shakha at the very same Ram Leela Ground with Muslim men guarding it from outside.“A few hours later, Muslims offered their namaaz in the park while the Hindus prepared seviyan for them,” said Mr. Bansal.“Even back then, many had said that it would be impossible to organise shakha and namaaz in that park on the same day, but we had told the locals to have faith in the police,” the DCP added.Khajuri Khas has witnessed two incidents of communal tension in the last six months
