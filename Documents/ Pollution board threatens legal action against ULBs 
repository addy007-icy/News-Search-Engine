The Odisha State Pollution Control Board has threatened to initiate legal action against those urban local bodies (ULBs) that have not moved to obtain permission for discharging treated sewage effluent in water-bodies and land in their respective jurisdiction.“Despite all efforts made by the Board, out of 111 ULBs, only 31 have applied for consent to operate under the Section 25/26 Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, but none of the ULBs has submitted the required time-bound action plan for setting up sewerage system till date,” the OSPCB informed Housing and Urban Development department in a letter.The OSPCB said: “Further the Board has issued direction under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to the Municipal Commissioner, Bhubaneswar, regarding treatment and utilisation of sewerage of water quality of river. Though the stipulated period is over, the Board is yet to receive any response from the Commission.”“The municipal authority is responsible for compliance of the provisions of the Section 25/26 Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Non-compliance of the said provision by discharging the sewerage effluent without previous consent of the Board will entail criminal action under the Act, which provides imprisonment of one and half years to six years,” the OSPCB warned.“Since ULBs are not obtaining consent of this Board despite several efforts, it has no option but to initiate legal action against those defaulting ULBs,” the OSPCB said.It is mandatory for all ULBs to obtain consent to operate as per the Section 25/26 Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and discharge treated sewage effluent into stream or well or land after maintaining the prescribed standards.
