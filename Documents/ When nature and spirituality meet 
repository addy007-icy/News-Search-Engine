Annuradha Malik, an artist from Chandigarh, was in the city for an art show, which concluded recently at theKarnataka Chitrakala Parishath.Her show, Molten Gold, was unique in its colour and generated a positive vibe. The artist, who is into Tanjore paintings and Mysore art, fused the Tanjore art style into some of her latest work. In a conversation with MetroPlus, Annuradha shares about what keeps her art ticking. Excerpts:What has been your inspiration?Nature has always been an inspiration to me. Art is very pure. It’s a reflection of what you think. I’m a spiritual person. But, that spirituality gets subdued with the environment around you.But, it was still there deep in me. As an artist I went through different phases -like once I wanted to do only abstracts, then I wanted to do only sketching.Art has to come from within. I always had that urge within me.Has art been your passion since childhood?Yes. As my father was an army officer, we travelled most of the time. My mother was inclined towards art, though she never painted. When I decided to take up art, my parents supported me.Tell us about your Molten Gold collection. How is it different from the typical Tanjore paintinsg?I started it when I came to Bengaluru and saw paintings here. I was naturally drawn towards them, especially the paintings of deities. This attracted me to Tanjore paintings. But in the Tanjore style, everyone was using water colours and the paintings had bloated faces which didn’t look natural to me.So I used the style to depict the deities in my own way. I decided to bring gold into my paintings. Then I found a way to put nature and gold together. So this collection is called Molten Gold.They are not entirely Tanjore because they are treated in my own way.
