Post the attack by Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed at the Pathankot airbase, the security plans have been scaled up, especially along the coast, for the upcoming International Fleet Review (IFR) to be held in the city from February 4 to 9.Taking the lead is the elite Marine Commando Force (Marcos) of the Indian Navy.The men from Marcos had begun securing the coast from Wednesday. They were seen operating in groups of four to five on board the fast-moving inflatable Gemini boats.According to sources, they will be operating from beyond Bheemunipatnam to Pudimadaka. Though the number of boats to be used is not known, it is estimated that at least 20 will be operating.Armed to the teeth with the most modern weapons such as the Israeli Tavor TAR-21 assault rifle and Glock 17 sidearm, the Marcos is Indian Navy’s pride, and it specialises in everything, from counter insurgency to underwater operations and sabotage to anti-piracy operations. It has a strong communication network and any intruder can be spotted even during night with the help of night vision equipment.Considered the best among the Special Forces in the world and even held in high esteem by the U.S. Navy Seals, the ‘men in black’ are trained to operate in all types of platforms — high seas, high-altitude warfare, operating in jungles and deserts.A source in the Marcos has said that while the naval ships will be scouting the blue waters, the Marine Commandos will be visibly present on and off the coast.“We intend to make it as tight as possible,” he says.
