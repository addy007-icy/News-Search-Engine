Jammu and Kashmir’s main regional party, the National Conference (NC), and human rights advocacy organisations on Tuesday took strong exception to conferring the Padma Vibushan award on former Governor Jagmohan.“Awarding a man like Jagmohan depicts moral bankruptcy. The world knows how Jagmohan butchered people in Kashmir and how he planned and organised things to put the people of Kashmir into trouble. He played a major role in the mass migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley to Jammu,” alleged NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar.The human rights organisation, Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, described the award as “an appreciation of his services, which saw massacres and hundreds of killings in the State”.
