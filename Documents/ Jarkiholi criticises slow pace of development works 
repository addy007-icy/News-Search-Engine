Small-Scale Industries Minister Satish L. Jarkiholi has said that the government takes nine years to complete works, which can be otherwise completed in “just nine months.”He was speaking at a function to mark the foundation stone laying for a postgraduate hostel for nursing students and commencement of renovation works of the district hospital at Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences here on Monday.LaughterHis remarks evoked laughter among students and enigmatic smiles on the faces of the guests on the dais. However, Feroz N.
