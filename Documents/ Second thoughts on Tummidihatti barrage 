The State government is seriously examining the option of changing the location of Tummidihatti barrage, the first component of Pranahitha-Chevella project, considering the possibility of delay in getting environmental clearance as a large chunk of forest land is likely to be submerged in its present location.Besides, the government is understood to have second thoughts on the high cost of a long barrage at its present location, even with the reduced full reservoir level (FRL) of 148 meters, where Wardha and Wainganga rivers confluence to take shape of Pranahita.AdvantageShifting the barrage location downstream of Tummidihatti is expected to bring down the barrage cost with the width of the flow condensing into one tributary from two, though it does not make any difference in lifting water up to 30 TMC ft to serve an ayacut of 2.2 lakh acres in Adilabad district.Official sources stated that shifting of the barrage location would bring down submergence of forest land in the Stateâ€™s territory considerably without impacting the benefit from it. It is being planned to utilise about 100 TMC ft of Indravati water with the barrage.Such location shifting is also being examined in case of Thupakulagudem barrage as part of Kanthanapalli project. The barrage site at Thupakulagudem has raised some opposition among the locals about submergence of their farm lands though it has overcome such impact in Chhattisgarh with the initially proposed site at Kanthanapalli, the sources said.The Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS) had submitted a draft of the detailed project report on Kanthanapalli, but it had been asked to rework the design following the plans to shift the barrage location again.
