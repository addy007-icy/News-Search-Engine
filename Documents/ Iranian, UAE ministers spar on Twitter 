Iran’s Foreign Minister said on Wednesday that the “arrogant nouveau-riche” should stay out of diplomacy after the United Arab Emirates mocked his criticism of Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. The barbed comments on Twitter by Mohammad Javad Zarif and UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan underline the strains between the two Gulf countries.On Sunday, Mr. Zarif published an editorial in the New York Times titled “Saudi Arabia’s Reckless Extremism”, deploring the kingdom’s human rights record and accusing Riyadh of supporting extremism.Sheikh Abdullah responded to Zarif's article the next day. “When I read the Iranian foreign minister’s article in the New York Times, I thought the author was the foreign minister of a Scandinavian country,” he tweeted in Arabic to 2.5 million followers, signing off with a grinning emoji.“Diplomacy is the domain of the mature; not arrogant nouveau-riche,” Mr. Zarif shot back on Wednesday.
