On the stage, it might look like a contest between the young ones, but behind the stage, it is very much a fight of the biggies. The drama competition at the State School Arts Festival, one of its prestige events, has over the years attracted some of the best talents from mainstream theatre, providing them a platform to experiment with children’s plays.Among those directing plays at this festival is Jino Joseph, the winner of the best director and scriptwriter awards this year’s Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards, a national-level theatre competition. His drama Sumesh, performed by students from St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School in Edoor of Kannur district, was one of the highlights of Friday.The drama brought on stage the travails of a person who is a key element of all plays – the one who pulls the curtain. With some brilliant props, including a revolving stage within a stage, it told the story of curtain man Sumesh who maintains his integrity even under severe pressure.K.V. Vijesh from the School of Drama was another known face, with an experience in working on children’s plays in the past. He brought on stage Puli Paranja Katha, based on a short story by P.V. Shajikumar. Filmmaker and dramatist M.G. Sasi directed a play based on the short story ‘Kuttavum Shikshayum’, written by Sarah Joseph. The play was presented by the students of Government HSS in Chalisseri of Thrissur district.Ambootti, the winner of this year’s State Film Award for the Best Dubbing Artist, directed the play presented by Cotton Hill Girls Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram.Even as big names have taken the event several notches higher in recent years, one of the key concerns has been regarding the subject of dramas.Only a few of them handle subjects for children. A vast majority of them handle weighty subjects more suited for professional drama.
