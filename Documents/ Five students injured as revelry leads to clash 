At least five law students staying in a hostel run by the Social Welfare Department for law students here suffered serious injuries and at least 12 vehicles parked inside the hostel were damaged and windowpanes damaged by a group of New Year revellers in the early hours of Friday.According to information available, trouble started around midnight when students in the hostel who were celebrating New Year by playing music objected to the intervention of around 15 outsiders in the celebrations. The law students chased away the outsiders after a wordy duel. The outsiders left behind some of their two-wheelers when they beat a retreat.Later, a local leader intervened in the matter and ensured the release of the vehicles left behind in the hostel by the outsiders. However, trouble was not over for the inmates of the hostel and in the early hours of Friday, the outsiders returned only to damage the vehicles parked inside the hostel.When a section of the inmates started protesting, they were beaten by the intruders who later escaped under the cover of darkness.The University Police Station, which has registered a case, was working on definite leads about the identity of the intruders who attacked the hostel inmates. Five students injured in the attack have been admitted in the United Hospital where their condition is said to be out of danger.Some of the injured students took exception to the absence of officials from the Social Welfare Department and said that it was condemnable that none of the officials from the department visited the hostel or the hospital where the inmates were admitted.At least 12 vehicles parked inside the hostel were damagedearly on Friday
