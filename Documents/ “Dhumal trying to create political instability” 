The Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee on Saturday lashed out at former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal saying he was trying to create ‘political instability’ in the State by repeatedly making statements regarding early Assembly elections.“Dhumal is trying to create an atmosphere of instability in the State by making statements that Assembly elections would be held before completion of full term but it is only his wishful thinking and an attempt to hide the frustration following stunning defeat of the BJP in the recent Panchayat and local body polls,” HPCC chief spokesman Naresh Chauhan said.Mr. Chauhan claimed that Mr. Dhumal was making such ‘undemocratic’ statements, only to remain in limelight but his efforts to create trust deficit between the government and the people would fail and he would be exposed.He said that the BJP had fielded candidates for panchayat elections and the panel of candidates was announced by Mr. Dhumal and State BJP chief Satpal Singh Satti, even though the Panchayat elections were not held on party symbols.“The BJP was expecting huge support from the general public in Panchayat elections but instead suffered shocking defeat which appears to be the reason for Mr. Dhumal making such childish statements,” Mr. Chauhan said.Thanking the people for their overwhelming support to the Congress in Panchayat and Urban local body elections, he said that it proved that the people were satisfied with the performance of the Congress-led government during the past three years. Mr. Chauhan said that the victory of over 75 per cent Congress-affiliated candidates proved that the government was able to fulfil the aspirations of the general people in its three-year rule. - PTI
