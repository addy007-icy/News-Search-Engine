The heat, dust and noise, the way the visible environment around you is polluted and how existing civic or traffic rules are blatantly violated are common enough for citizens during an election campaign.And so is the way contesting candidates giving up etiquette and slamming their opponents in the choicest of language too. Social media too has turned into a battleground, during the campaign.Take this for example. Around noon on Thursday, Nara Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu tweeted @KTRTRS thus. “Anasuya mistook me for you & fell in front of my vehicle in the tour as she has no other way of reaching you. She has a question. Where is her 2BHK flat that was promised? She & many others like her are waiting for your answer.”An hour later, K.T. Rama Rao, Minister for IT & Panchayati Raj and son of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao tweeted back saying, “ @naralokesh : Brother, Glad she understands that it is the State Govt. and party in power that can make it happen. Will take care of her and many others like her too. Thanks for bringing it to my attention & good luck with the electioneering. May the better party win.”It was not just the wordy duel that entertained those active on the social media. For those with time and the inclination, scroll down the Twitter timelines of the two young leaders, the reactions from other twitterati too are worth a read.
