The two-day cartoon festival organised by Cartoon Kundapra and Dr. A.V. Baliga Charities, which began here on Sunday, attracted a lot of people.As many as 120 cartoons and caricatures by 16 cartoonists are on display at the festival at the Mother of Sorrows Church premises here.Panju Gangolli, a cartoonist whose cartoons were on display, said that the cartoonists were having a whale of a time ever since the Siddharamaiah government came to power in the State and the Modi government assumed power at the centre.Various programmes announced by both these governments such as “Shaadi Bhagya,” “Make in India” and issues such as intolerance, Award Wapsi and protection of cow, provided the cartoonists with ample material to come up with new cartoons.“Truth be told, if there is a negative development, it is a feast for the cartoonist. Whether ‘Ache Din’ (good days) have come for people or not, I don’t know. But it is ‘Ache Din’ for the cartoonists,” Mr. Gangolli said.The people, who came to see the cartoons, enjoyed watching them. Virupaksha Devaramane, psychiatrist, said that after watching the cartoons, people laughed at others, then they laughed at themselves.K.P. Rao, software expert, said that he had been enjoying cartoons since the times of noted cartoonist, late R.K. Laxman drew them. “Many cartoons exhibited here are not just humorous but also cerebral. It has been a pleasure watching the cartoons here,” he said.Cartoonists would be drawing caricatures of individuals here on Monday. The proceeds of the sales of these caricatures would be provided for the renovation of Asha Nilaya Special School here.Earlier, G.K. Prabhu, Director of Manipal Institute of Technology, inaugurated the festival.
