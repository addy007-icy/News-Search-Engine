Geeta’s style focuses mainly on human figures and heads expressing various human emotions. Sheela’s special installation, titled “Dana Chugney Aaye Chidhya”, aims to bring to light the issue of disappearing sparrows.Sheela shares that sparrows give her immense pleasure and happiness, and that she loves watching birds and squirrels pick on one grain after another, untiringly, automatically and determinedly.

She hopes her installation inspires the public to feed them, give them water and use limited amount of pesticides and chemicals in the garden.The exhibition is on at Triveni Kala Sangam till January 29.‘Trilogy of Expression’ is on at Triveni Kala Sangam tillJanuary 29
