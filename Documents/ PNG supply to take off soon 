What looked like a distant dream for homemakers in Kochi will soon become a reality with Ernakulam Medical College getting the first piped natural gas connection on January 26.Supply lines have been established for the six connections at the Medical College that will be part of the city gas supply programme. The connections include those for the kitchens attached to the various hostels in the Medical College, sources said on Thursday.The city gas project is being implemented by the consortium Indian Oil-Adani Gas Private Limited and will cover the whole of Ernakulam district in a phased manner.Pipeline work for reaching natural gas to other parts of the district is in progress. One of the sites where the work was in progress was along the road stretch between Kangarappady and Kalamassery. The trunk lines will consist of eight-inch steel pipes and for last mile connectivity medium density polyethylene pipes will be used. The gas will be metered and paid for according to the quantum of consumption.Piped natural supply reaching homes will get rid of the problem of delay and shortage in LPG supplies that stem from supply backlogs caused mostly by disruption in the operations of bottling plants or even transport strikes. Sources said that an average family of four could get a monthâ€™s piped natural gas for around Rs. 300, making it cheaper than the conventional cooking gas.With the city gas distribution project taking off, Kochi takes a step closer to getting compressed natural gas for automobiles. Indian Oil Corporation is expected to open compressed natural gas outlets in the district as the city gas distribution network is put in place.The city gas project was delayed by a court case involving the IOC-Adani consortium after the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board approved the consortium for taking up the work in Ernakulam.
