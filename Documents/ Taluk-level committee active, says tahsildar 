T.J. Guruprasad, Udupi Tahsildar, has said that a taluk-level committee comprising the Tahisildar, four Revenue Inspectors and Police Sub-Inspectors of the area, look into complaints regarding sand extraction.“Whenever any complaint is received, I ask the Revenue Inspector and the Police Sub-Inspector to investigate and take action as there is staff shortage in the Department of Mines and Geology. From March to December 2015, we seized 18 trucks and imposed Rs. 35,000 penalty in Udupi taluk,” he said.As many as 22 sand-laden trucks were seized for overloading during the same period. The additional sand was later auctioned by the Public Works Department, Mr. Guruprasad said.Mahesh, Geologist, Department of Mines and Geology, said that the department had taken action, whenever complaints were lodged with it. “Whenever we are there, we visit the spot and take action. When our officers are not in the headquarters, we alert the police,” he said.
