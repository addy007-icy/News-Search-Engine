The Kashmir Flycatcher was spotted in Aravenu near Kotagiri in The Nilgiris this winter after twoyears.The bird was last spotted on December 22, 2015 and efforts were on to study its behavioural pattern. The sightings of the bird in the Nilgiris were recorded in Doddabetta, Avalanchi, Cairn hill, Botanical garden and SIMS Park in Coonoor .It is actually rare to see the bird in a lower elevation than Udhagamandalam but it was spotted at 1,718 meters which is quite low compared to Ooty.The migratory flycatcher has a small, declining population and breeding range is also severely fragmented because of the changes in climatic condition the and mixed deciduous forests. The species may soon fall under the vulnerable category.The Kashmir Flycatcher migrates southwards from its breeding grounds or native place to winter chiefly in the hills of central and southern Sri Lanka and the South Western Ghats, especially in the Nilgiris.They are found in Silent Valley National Park, Mukkurthi National Park and Siruvani forest reserve. With tracts of forests being cleared and uncontrolled urbanisation, the wintering habitat of the bird is shrinking.
