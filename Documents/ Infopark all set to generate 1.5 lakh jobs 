Infopark Kochi is eyeing to develop 15 million square feet generating around 1.5 lakh jobs by 2020.An investment of Rs.3,700 crore would go into the Kochi campus and its two campuses at Cherthala and Koratty by then. Talking at a roundtable here on Wednesday, Infopark CEO Hrishikesh Nair said that by the end of the current financial year the existing built-up space in the Kochi campus would scale up from the existing 4.50 million sq.ft. to 6 million sq.ft.“The first phase would be completed in another two years taking the total built-up space to 7 million, employing about 70,000 people. The Rs. 2,500-crore second phase when completed would have 8 million sq.ft. space generating 80,000 jobs,” Mr. Nair said. The first government-funded IT building in the 160-acre second phase is expected to be commissioned next month while almost the entire parcel of land already has takers.Completion of construction by Tata Consultancy Services (13 lakh sq.ft.), Lulu (13 lakh sq.ft.), and Brigade Enterprises (7.50 lakh sq.ft.), which are under way, is likely to mark the completion of the first phase of Infopark.After registering a record-breaking growth of 52 per cent in IT exports during the 2014-15 fiscal, Infopark expects 30 per cent growth during this fiscal in keeping with the national average. When the State’s IT exports exceeded Rs 10,000 crore during 2014-15, Infopark accounted for more than Rs. 3,000 crore.Asked about the future growth of Infopark with the land at its disposal set to be exhausted with the second phase, Mr. Nair said that would either necessitates a fresh land acquisition or the government would have to part with its available land. “That makes the development of our spokes at Cherthala and Koratty all the more important,” he said. Infopark has developed over 200 acres out of the 363 acres at its disposal. Infopark is also going ahead with its support for start-ups, as its twin incubators - Technology Business Centre in Kaloor and Smart Business Centre at Kakkanad, are presently engaged in incubating over 60 start-ups.
