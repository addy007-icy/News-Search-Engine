Bogged down by space constraint, the A.P Capital Region Development Authority (AP-CRDA) has invited tenders for taking rented buildings on lease to move out of its existing temporary offices at Gandhi Nagar in Vijayawada city and Thullur in Guntur district.The CRDA headquarters is at present located in the office building of erstwhile Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority (VGTM-UDA) and the building it is currently functioning from in Thullur is a primary health centre.Since the governmentâ€™s concentration is for the time being on creation of core infrastructure comprising the Raj Bhavan, Assembly, Secretariat and High Court, the CRDA decided to look for spacious buildings before its head office comes up in the seed capital. It has invited tenders for hiring buildings with office space of 6,000 to 8,000 square feet each before its plan for permanent infrastructure materializes.January 20 has been fixed as the last date for submitting applications at the CRDA office in Vijayawada and once the eligible bidders are selected, the offices will move to the new locations in Vijayawada and Thullur.As the space constraint has become problematic, the CRDA even contemplated to regularise buildings that are suitable but have been constructed in violation of approved plans, to move out as quickly as possible. Enough parking space is sought to be ensured at the buildings.As far as lease rent is concerned, the CRDA officials have proposed to the government to pay it once in three years or at such intervals mutually agreed upon (by CRDA and building owners) instead of every month. CRDA Additional Commissioner V. Prasanna Venkatesh has recently inspected a few buildings in and around Thullur and some in Vijayawada city.January 20 has been fixed as the last date for submitting applications at the CRDA office in Vijayawada
