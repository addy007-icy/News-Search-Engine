Even as the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) findings reveal widespread lack of awareness about HIV/AIDS among women, the drastic budgetary cut coupled with paid health services, even in government hospitals for patients in Karnataka, has hit the prevention programme.According to the NFHS-4 (2015-16), the proportion of women with knowledge of HIV/AIDS in Karnataka, which was already low at 11.6 per cent a decade ago, has slipped to 9.5 per cent. Awareness among men has also reduced from 29.1 per cent a decade ago to 26.3 per cent.Interestingly, while the percentage of women who have knowledge that condom use can reduce the chances of getting the disease has increased from 34.8 a decade ago to 50, it has slipped from 73.8 to 65.9 among men.Terming this as a worrying trend, David B. from Sangama, a human rights organisation of sexuality minorities, attributed it directly to the budgetary cut by the Centre and halting of targeted interventions in several districts.Paid servicesMeanwhile, patients visiting Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres in teaching hospitals (affiliated to government medical colleges in the State) have been postponing undergoing medical tests for related ailments. They are even dropping out of treatment as they have to pay for the diagnostic services.Sources said the patients were finding it hard as they had to spend nothing less than Rs. 1,000 on periodic diagnostic tests that include complete blood count, lipid profile, liver function and renal function tests, apart from any ultrasound scans and imaging services, if required. Only the CD4 count is done for free in these hospitals.While the services are free in hospitals run by the Health Department, patients availing of treatment in the ART centres of hospitals run by the Medical Education Department have to pay. This, doctors, said was hitting the patients hard and taking a toll on their health. “Although we try to convince the patients that the tests are mandatory, most postpone getting them done as they cannot afford them. If we insist, they even drop out of treatment, affecting the prevention programme,” said a senior medical officer at the ART centre in Victoria Hospital.The services that were free prior to 2009 are being charged after the medical colleges became autonomous.
