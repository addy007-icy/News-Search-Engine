Velachery might have emerged as an important terminal on the railway map of the city, but for several hundred commuters it is a daunting task to have quick and easy access to the station.Not just commuters who reach the Velachery station to board the Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) trains, but motorists using the service road to reach Inner Ring Road also complain that the road width has been reducing.The absence of a pavement makes it risky for pedestrians to walk on the stretch, they say, adding that the problem is due to encroachments by hawkers and commercial establishments.With several commercial establishments coming up along the service road, visitors to these shops rob space for pedestrians and cyclists. Makeshift shops too eat into the road space, residents complain.S. Harishkumar, of Ram Nagar third Main Road in Velachery, said with the service road being very narrow, pedestrians were exposed to risks. He said the traffic police were coming up very little initiatives other than placing temporary barricades. The service road should be widened and pavements created for pedestrians, he added.The road belonging to the State Highways Department was now being widened for a stretch of 600 metres, officials said, adding that a stormwater drain was also being constructed. The work’s estimated cost was Rs. 5.5 crore, officials said. “We are constructing a stormwater drain on the MRTS station side with a four-metre wide pavement on top of it. Since thousands of commuters use the stretch regularly and with requests for widening, we initiated the work,” officials said.The absence of a pavement makes it risky for pedestrians to walk on the stretch
