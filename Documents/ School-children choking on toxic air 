ir samples taken from classrooms around the Capital have shown that students are being exposed to cancer-causing heavy metals in schools, according to a report released by Greenpeace on Thursday.The environmental group collected air samples from inside classrooms in six schools in October and November last year. Five out of the six schools had levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) above the Indian standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The levels of PM2.5 in all samples were higher than the 24-hour mean set by the World Health Organisation, which is 25 micrograms per cubic metre. Though the data of the PM2.5 levels were released on December 2, 2015, what exactly constitutes the particulate matter was revealed in Thursday’s report.In samples from five schools, one or more metal was found in a concentration higher than the respective limit. In 70 per cent and 40 per cent of schools respectively the concentrations of cadmium and arsenic were higher than prescribed standards. Arsenic, cadmium, nickel and chromium are carcinogenic, while lead and manganese affect the cognitive and motor development of children in particular.In one of the schools, located at Meera Bagh, samples were taken on two days – a normal working day and a holiday. The level of PM2.5 was 629.98 micrograms per cubic metre at that school on November 6, a working day, while it was 119.38 on October 16, 2015 – a holiday.Sunil Dahiya, a campaigner for Greenpeace India, said the results of the study showed that school students were being exposed to very high levels of heavy metals, which “increase the risk of cancer and developmental problems”.“Higher the PM2.5 concentrations, higher will be the exposure to heavy metals. Most of these particles are attached to the anthropogenic impacts caused due to fossil fuel (coal and oil) burned for energy and transportation sector,” said Mr. Dahiya.He added that Delhi needed to take measures to reduce pollution exposure for children by shutting down schools temporarily and restricting outdoor activity.In one of the schools, located at Meera Bagh, the levelof PM2.5 was 629.98 micrograms per cubic metre (10 times the standard limit)
