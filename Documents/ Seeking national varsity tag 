University of Mysore is preparing a detailed proposal for submitting to the Centre to accord it the status of a national university. At the Indian Science Congress, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accord the status to the century-old university in recognition of its legacy and academic excellence. In continuation, the university is preparing a detailed note on why it deserves to get the coveted tag. Vice-Chancellor K.S. Rangappa said he also discussed this with Union Minister for Human Resource Development Smrithi Irani, who inaugurated the Women’s Science Congress, and she asked him to send the proposal to the Ministry. “Our university deserves the tag and we all hope to get the recognition. Even the funding to the university goes up, thereby helping to take up more research,” he said.
