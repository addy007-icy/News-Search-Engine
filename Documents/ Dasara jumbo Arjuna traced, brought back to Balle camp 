The Forest Department officials are keeping extra vigil after Arjuna, the 56-year-old lead Dasara elephant which carries the golden howdah during the annual Jamboo Savari, went ‘missing’ for a couple of days and was later found in neighbouring Kerala forest area. Arjuna, which is in heat (musth), strayed into the forest from Balle camp in Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, after breaking its chains a few days ago. It could not be traced immediately and had become untraceable for almost two days.Though Arjuna’s mahout and kavadi and other forest officials went searching for him, they could not trace the jumbo. However, forest officials received information on Arjuna’s whereabouts and a team from Balle went to the spot and captured the elusive elephant. Arjuna was brought to the camp on Tuesday and has been kept under close observation.Nagarahole Tiger Reserve director H. C. Kantharaj told The Hindu that Arjuna was in musth and therefore, the staff have been asked to keep extra vigil for another 15 days.“The cooling ration to address its musth has been started from Wednesday … The diet largely comprises pulses and other food items to bring down its body temperature …We cannot take any chance as it is a Dasara jumbo. The staff have been asked to stay alert even during the night,” he said. Mr. Kantharaj, however, claimed that Arjuna had not strayed into Kerala, but was within Nagarahole’s jurisdiction. “It was within a range of 20 k.m.,” he said.Balle range forest officer has been asked to keep sufficient stock of the ration and ensure Arjuna gets more food to address its condition, he said. “The tusker should have been traced immediately after it went missing,” he said and added that Arjuna’s mahout will be served a notice over the incident.
