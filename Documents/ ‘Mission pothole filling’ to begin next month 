There could be some relief from potholed roads as the Mysore City Corporation (MCC) will soon take up ‘Mission Pothole Filling’ across 65 wards next month.After being bombarded with complaints from residents, the MCC has released Rs. 30 lakh each to every ward for pothole filling and improving roads. The potholes have to be identified and photographed before the works are launched, and elected representatives had been asked to oversee the protocol.“This clause had been included to facilitate third party inspection after work completion for accountability and quality. Random inspection of works will be carried out across the wards. We want to establish accountability and transparency in works. The funds have to be best utilised,” explained Mayor B.L. Bhyrappa.He told The Hindu that ward councillors had been told to give first priority for pothole filling and road betterment from the remaining funds.Works on major roads had begun from the funds released earlier, he said, admitting that many had been dotted by potholes.However, the biggest worry, especially among area residents, was regarding the quality of road works. As noticed in the past, the newly-laid asphalt wears off especially after rains.Even during Dasara, when works to fill-up potholes had been taken up as part of city beautification, the potholes opened up after some days, exposing the quality of works. “Roads indicate the importance given by the local administration or the State administration for development. Motorists must get safe carriageways,” said a resident of Kuvempunagar.When this issue was raised, Mr. Bhyrappa said: “We have made it mandatory for the contractor to use 20 mm construction aggregates (crushed stones) along with asphalt for filling up potholes.”
