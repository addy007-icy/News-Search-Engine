Eavesdrop on any conversation that discusses travel plans and Corsica is sure to figure in the list of dream holiday destinations. Such has been the spell Tamasha cast on us. Through Ravi Varman’s lens, we felt the warmth of this Mediterranean island, the chills of a Delhi winter, the stillness of Calcutta, the loneliness of Japan. Tamil films, too, have taken us around for a world tour, but why aren’t the visuals as arresting and brilliant, even if captured by the same cinematographer?“This is a question actor Suriya also asked me,” says Ravi. K Chandran, who has shot both Hindi and Tamil films. “We were shooting an ad together, and he asked why films and ads shot in Mumbai looked better than those made in Chennai, even with the same director and cameraman. Like Gordon Willis (who shot The Godfather) said, cinematography is just 10 per cent of a scene. Make-up artists, costume designers and the art department in Mumbai strive for higher standards. Even the way a bathroom is set up would be brilliant. Ad film director Babu Shankar, too, noticed this difference just five minutes into shooting an ad in Mumbai, and said he would always shoot in Mumbai if budgets permit.”So, is the better quality of visuals a result of bigger budgets and support staff alone? Don’t Tamil films have large budgets? Sivakumar Vijayan, the cinematographer of Irudhi Suttru (Saala Khadoos in Hindi) and the upcoming Karthik Subbaraj film Iraivi, asks why Iranian films look so much better, even with budgets lower than in Tamil cinema. He feels it’s because a lot of Tamil films fail to accommodate the extra space and time which cinematographers require to create something unique. “There have been times when I’ve canned 95 shots on a single day, whereas films like Bajirao Mastani are made by canning just four or five shots per day. From the time the film is scheduled, the team should schedule some extra time for the cinematographer to try new things — only then will films endure.”Natty, the cameraman behind the path-breaking work in Anurag Kashyap’s Black Friday and Pradeep Sarkar’s Parineeta, feels it’s the liberty to experiment that he misses when he works down south. “Here, there are times when they dismiss the cameraman, saying, ‘All the audience wants to see is the hero’. So, the producers might be willing to spend money on those shots, overlooking the overall beauty of the film. In Hindi, there’s a combined effort between departments, to create a better output.”Cinematographers also feel there are a lot of pre-conceived rules that directors are unwilling to risk breaking. Ravi Varman, who broke several conventions of cinematography in films like Tamasha and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, feels directors like Imtiaz Ali help him push boundaries. “Have you noticed how most films we shoot abroad tend to be shown in shades of blue?” Varman asks. “It comes from our habit of imitating Hollywood every time we shoot abroad. So when I went to Corsica, I was thrilled by the sodium tinge I could give the shots, and it has connected well with the audience.“Have you noticed how most films we shoot abroad tend to be shown in shades of blue?” Varman asks. “It comes from our habit of imitating Hollywood every time we shoot abroad. So when I went to Corsica, I was thrilled by the sodium tinge I could give the shots, and it has connected well with the audience. Similarly, Imtiaz suggested that I shoot the flashback portions of Tamasha in such a way that they take us back to school. Even though it was risky, I insisted on creating heavily grainy visuals to create a dreamy, nostalgic feel. What is considered ‘bad’ camera work has helped us create an effective visual tool.”Add to it the unique perspective an outsider brings to every frame, and you have a new way of looking at the same old places. So when first-timer Gavemic U Ary visited Madurai, he was able to show us the city like we’ve never seen before. “People told me Jigarthanda looked like a South American film, and they asked me what films the director had shown me so I could shoot Madurai like that. But I feel cinematography is a lot about how you react to a place, its people and culture. As a Tamilian, you want to give it your best when you’re shooting a Tamil film. I would choose a Tamil film over a Hindi film if I have to.”But when these cinematographers work in a Tamil film, they tend to get a bit emotional, to the point where the production constraints begin to affect their work. Sivakumar Vijayan adds, “When I go to the sets of a Tamil film, I instinctively start thinking from the production point of view. I start worrying about matters like the artist’s call sheet, whether I will exceed the budget if I ask for a few more lights, or if I could ask for a few more retakes to get a perfect shot — all of which take away from the calmness one needs to create something new.”What about remuneration then? Do Hindi films pay better? “You could get the same remuneration in both industries,” feels Natty. “But in Tamil, negotiations would start with producers offering to pay you just 30 per cent of what you’ve asked for. Hindi producers have several parameters like a cameraman’s working style and past hit record. Their offers seem fairer in comparison.”Gavemic says, “Instead of paying for the quality you bring to the table, there’s a tendency here to pay less when they feel you’re out of work or if you’ve not signed a new movie. It’s like they’re trying to get a good deal, even if they can afford it. They want to pay for the worker… not the artist.”
