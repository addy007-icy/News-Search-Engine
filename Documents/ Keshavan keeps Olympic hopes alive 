The year 2015 started with a personal best for Shiva Keshavan at the Nations Cup in Norway and ended with silver at the Asian championships in Japan earlier this week. Common between the two was a struggle for resources, adapting to unfamiliar equipment and playing lone ranger in a sport where psychology and support play as big a role as physical excellence.On a short break from competition, Keshavan, a veteran of five Winter Olympics, is in town to try and get government support for his training — or, at the very least, for retaining his coach.Throughout the year, his coach — American Duncan Kennedy — has been his family, friend and support system that kept him on the road. “At least this year I have had Duncan with whom I can talk and train and work out problems. It’s only this year that I have had that luxury and already there has been a big improvement,” he said.The Sports Ministry earlier this year agreed to bear his coaching expenses but Keshavan just smiled. “Duncan’s salary is $4,000 a month. The ministry sanctioned a maximum of Rs. 10 lakh that is approximately four month’s pay. If the government can only assure me of taking care of his salary, I would be able to manage a lot better,” he shrugged.The official qualifiers for the Pyeongchang Olympics would begin in 2017 with only 35 spots available. Up next are the three remaining World Cups for this season, all in Germany. “MTS pulled out this year so I only have Coca Cola supporting me, like they have been doing for a long time now. In fact, I have been able to participate in the handful of World Cups because of them only, for which I am grateful. For the rest, I and my wife have been tucking deep into our savings to work out a skeletal training programme,” he said.
