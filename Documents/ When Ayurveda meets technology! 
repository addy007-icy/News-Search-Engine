This is the marriage of the most ancient Indian medicine system with that of the very latest Information Technology. A software, exclusively meant for Ayurvedic doctors, is being developed so that they do not deviate from the classical Ayurveda methods while treating patients and also keeps them updated about the best medical practises. The software, ‘Integrated Clinical Decision Support System’ is being developed by National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage (NIIMH), Hyderabad, based on exhaustive research and will be out in a year’s time.The easy-to-use software will require the physician to just enter the symptoms of the patient. Based on probable science, a list of diseases will be shown as results that are most likely to be the cause of the patient’s illness. For each of the diseases, the software will guide the doctor in investigation, diagnosis and even treatment of the patient in the most traditional manner. “This is a first-of-its-kind digital tool that will make sure that Ayurveda doctors do not go wrong and also follow the prescribed treatments as per the ancient system,” said A. Narayana, Director, NIIMH. “In 2008, we brought out an Ayurveda encyclopaedia which had scientific meanings of 3,000 words. During the course of working on this project, we had digitised most of our research work. An e-book titled Charakasamhitha was the by-product of the earlier project. These two projects gave rise to the thought of developing this software, which is going to be a very useful tool for the doctors.”NIIMH develops a software for Ayurvedic doctors not to let them deviate from the classical methods of treatment
