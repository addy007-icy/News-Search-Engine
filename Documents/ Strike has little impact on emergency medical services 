The indefinite strike by contract employees of 108 ambulance service under the Arogya Kavacha scheme providing free medical emergency services had little or no impact on the extension of emergency ambulance services in Kalaburagi district.Sources told The Hindu here on Thursday that of the 59 drivers and 56 emergency medical technicians working on contract basis for GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute to operate 25 ambulances in the district, 58 drivers and 50 emergency medical technicians are on strike.However, the District Health and Family Welfare Department made alternative arrangements to ensure that the emergency health services provided under Arogya Kavacha scheme were not disrupted. The department has availed itself of the services of 14 drivers from the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and six drivers from the Health Department to operate ambulances under the scheme to ensure smooth operation.According to District Health and Family Welfare Officer Mohammad Zakir Ansari, the 108 ambulance call centre received 43 calls in the last 24 hours and all these calls were attended to and patients required to be shifted to hospitals were taken to hospitals using the 108 ambulance service. However, there was some delay in reaching patients to hospitals as the new drivers were not familiar with the terrain.He said that most of the ambulances were not accompanied by emergency medical technicians, as a majority of them were on strike. However, the absence of medical technicians did not affect shifting patients to hospitals, Dr. Ansari said.District Health and Family Welfare Department makes alternative arrangements
