The Telangana Government has decided to change its representation on the two river boards – Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB), set up as per the provision made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act – for presenting its case better towards protecting its interests in the boards’ meetings.The change has been felt necessary, according to official sources, following objections raised by Principal Secretary (Irrigation) of AP Aditya Nath Das to the presence of Advisor (Irrigation) to Telangana Government R. Vidyasagar Rao in the GRMB meeting held here on Thursday.“A letter will be written soon to the two boards seeking replacement of Telangana’s Engineer-in-Chief who is the Technical Member on the panels with Advisor (Irrigation),” sources stated.As per the AP Reorganisation Act, “two members, to be nominated by each of the successor States, of which one shall be the Technical Member not below the rank of Chief Engineer and the other Administrative Member to represent the concerned States” would compose the boards besides Chairperson in the rank of Secretary or Additional Secretary, an expert and a member-secretary, all three nominated by the Centre. Accordingly, Mr. Vidyasagar Rao, who earlier in his career has served as a Chief Engineer in the Central Water Commission (CWC), would replace ENC C. Muralidhar in the river board meetings henceforth to present Telangana’s argument better. “The change is being proposed with an additional provision for the ENC attending the meetings in the absence of the Advisor,” the sources stated. It is understood that the change is being planned to put an end to objections of AP in future meetings besides presenting Telangana’s case better.
