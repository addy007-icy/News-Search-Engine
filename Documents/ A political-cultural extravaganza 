With elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats due next month, the public meeting organised to mark the laying of foundation stone for various development works and inauguration of a few others, in all, worth Rs. 1,000 crore in Udapudi village of Ramdurg taluk, turned out to be a mega political-cultural extravaganza, even as large number of people from all over Ramdurg and Mudhol taluk of Bagalkot district converged here for the event on Monday.Officially organised by the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited, Irrigation (North), under the leadership of the government’s Chief Whip and Ramdurg MLA Ashok M. Pattan, an enthralling concert by vocalist Sangeeta Katti Kulkarni held the audience captive for nearly three-and-a-half hours, the time spent in waiting for the Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to arrive at the venue.The occasion was also a pleasing and a thanks-giving affair for Mr. Pattan. Along with felicitations, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Information Technology Minister S.R. Patil, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patil, Minister for Urban Development Department Qamar-ul-Islam, Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil and Small Scale Industries Minister Satish L. Jarkiholi, were presented expensive gifts — each one of them received a nearly three-feet-long silver mace. Food was arranged for all those who attended the function.The event turned out to be the most memorable one for Mr. Pattan as the proceedings were held in the graceful presence of his parents, both former MLAs, Shardamma and Mahadevappa Pattan, who are now aged 96 and 105, respectively, and whose hearts were filled with joy to see their son’s achievements.
