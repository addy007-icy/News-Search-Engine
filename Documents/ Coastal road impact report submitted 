The ambitious coastal road project of the State government took another step towards reality with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation submitting the project’s environment impact assessment (EIA) study to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) on Saturday.The EIA submitted by a civic team led by additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Mukherjee is believed to have chalked out a series of mitigation measures that would be undertaken to protect the marine life and flora and fauna during the course of construction of the 33.2-km coastal freeway.The proposed road running from Nariman Point to Kandivali in North Mumbai cuts through mangroves and may involve reclamation of land from the sea. It is for this reason permission of the MCZMA is mandated.The project recently got clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests. A gazette notification in this regard has already been issued.The coastal freeway is the BJP-Shiv Sena government’s showpiece project and the government is pushing hard to have a ground-breaking ceremony before the municipal elections in 2017.Environmentalists have, however, flagged it as a threat to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules and the coastline in general. The permission given by the Environment Ministry has explicitly put a condition on not allowing any construction on the landward side of the project. It has also put another condition that the road should not be commercially exploited in future.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has already announced it will be a toll-free road.
