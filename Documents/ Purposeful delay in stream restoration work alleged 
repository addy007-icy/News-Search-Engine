Environmentalists campaigning for wetland and paddy land conservation here have accused the district authorities of consciously delaying the natural stream restoration work at Aranmula Puncha.K.P. Sreeranganathan, environmentalist who had moved the National Green Tribunal against the controversial airport project at Aranmula, alleged that the authorities were protecting the interests of the culprit who had illegally converted the natural stream, Karimaramthode, making a mockery of the Kerala High Court order in this regard.‘Lame excuses’Mr. Sreeranganathan alleged that the district administration was wilfully avoiding the stream restoration process by supporting the lame excuses made by the accused that he was yet to find a suitable place for dumping the earth removed from the puncha. Had the administration been committed to complying with the court order, it would have made appropriate arrangements for utilising the earth removed from the puncha for various government projects, he alleged.Aranmula Heritage Village Action Council president P. Induchoodan said the villagers would soon launch an agitation against the official apathy towards the stream restoration process.Only 10 cents restoredMr. Sreeranganathan said the work was abruptly stopped on August 19, 2015, after partially removing the upper layer of earth in about 10 cents of the illegally converted 6.35-acre portion of the stream.The High Court direction was on the basis of a writ petition moved by V. Mohanan, a farmer from Aranmula.Mr. Mohanan had once again moved the court seeking contempt of court proceedings against the District Collector for not complying with the order even after five months.Meanwhile, Renjith Thampan, senior lawyer representing the petitioner, said the district authority was bound to restore the natural stream to its original position in a time-bound manner as directed by the court.Mr. Induchoodan alleged that the administration had been hand-in-glove with the offenders by not taking a decision on the excess land issue, cancellation of the mutation of land and so on.
