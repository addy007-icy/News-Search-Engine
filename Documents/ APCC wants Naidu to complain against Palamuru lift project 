The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee has demanded that Chandrababu Naidu government should lodge a complaint with the Central Water Commission, Krishna Water Management Board and Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy lift irrigation scheme being taken up by the Telangana Government.The Government of the neighbouring Telangana was all set to invite tenders for the project in a couple of days in spite of the fact that it had not received clearances from the authorities concerned. The project, if constructed, would harm the interests of farmers in Krishna and Penna deltas in Andhra Pradesh, but the Government remained indifferent to the issue, APCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy said.Mr. Raghuveera Reddy attacked the government for maintaining silence on the Rs. 27,000 crore project that was against the interests of the people in the lower riparian State.The Congress on its part lodged a complaint with the Governor and the Chief Minister explaining about the harmful impact it would have on the drinking and irrigation needs of Andhra Pradesh when the foundation stone for the project was laid. “But there has been no response from the government when the neighbouring State is gearing up to call for tenders,” he said.The APCC president criticised the Chief Minister for not raising the issue during his meetings with his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Mr. Naidu, who is in the thick of cash for vote episode, was going slow on prevailing upon the neighbouring State to stop the construction of the project. “Mr. Naidu is trying to wriggle himself out of the cash for vote episode and hence, remained silent despite the ground being prepared for the launch of works. He should at least now take steps to ensure that the State’s interests are not mortgaged ,” he said.
