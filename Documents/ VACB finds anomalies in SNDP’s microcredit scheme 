An anti-corruption court here on Wednesday heard that the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau was aware of the anomalies in the SNDP Yogam-led distribution of microcredit to underprivileged backward classes since 2007.C.C. Augustine, Vigilance legal adviser, told Vigilance Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge John. K. Illikadan that a VACB confidential inquiry into the allegations in 2007 had revealed a discrepancy in microcredit disbursal accounts amounting to Rs.80 lakh.The inquiry had found that the Kerala State Backward Classes Development Corporation had released microcredit funds through SNDP unions without verifying the genuineness of the beneficiaries.No fund utilisation certificates were sought. The inquiry had recommended department action against the then corporation chairman.Vigilance Additional Director (Prosecution) G. Sasindran told The Hindu that the report, which was submitted in court, did not pertain to the complaint filed by Leader of the Opposition V. S. Achuthanandan against the SNDP Yogam leadership.The anti-corruption court was considering Mr. Achuthanandan’s plea that SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan be prosecuted on charges of fraud, embezzlement and graft.Mr. Achuthanandan had accused Mr. Natesan of having misappropriated huge sums of public money from a State-funded microfinance scheme for underprivileged backward class people.The stated aim of SNDP’s flag ship scheme was to provide microcredit to its members through its 1,000-odd self-help groups (SHG) in the State.However, he alleged that Mr. Natesan had turned the scheme into a money-lending operation that personally benefitted him and his coterie.
