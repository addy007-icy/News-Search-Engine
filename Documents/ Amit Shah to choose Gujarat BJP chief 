Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah is likely to select the president of Gujarat BJP unit, which is being revamped to gear up the cadre for the next Assembly polls in December 2017.According to the party insiders, Mr. Shah will have a final say in the appointment, not Chief Minister Anandiben Patel.“After the party's rout in the local elections, the Chief Minister’s clout within the party has diminished. Organisationally, Mr. Shah will have final say in the appointment of office-bearers including the State unit president,” a senior BJP leader told The Hindu.Mr. Shah is arriving in Ahmedabad on a private family visit for three days, but is likely to have meetings with leaders to select the president.
