A blend of colours, local Rajastani folk songs, dance and reminisces about the nine-year journey of the festival were the highlights of the inaugural session of the 2016 edition of the Jaipur Literature festival.It was inaugurated by Chief Minister of Rajashtan, Vasundhara Raje, along with the festival directors Sanjoy Roy, Willam Dalrymple and Namita Gokhale.Talking about the fest, William said, “When we started 10 years ago, our audience was a small group of about 15 people, some of them tourists who had lost their way. We now host almost 50,000 people spread across the five days of the festival. We have had students and delegates from across the country, and the world.”Sanjoy Ghosh pointed out, “Rajastan is a beautiful state with art and culture as a vital part of its ethos. Jaipur and Rajastan have adopted it, and made this festival one of their own.”The chief minister talked about attending the festival many times as a member of the audience, and described her experiences. “I am always fascinated to meet writers and thinkers I have read and heard about. I was always interested in literature and had perfected the art of reading under a blanket with a torch for company. I am also interested in the fact that Rajastan and Jaipur get an opportunity to host such a talented group of people every year. I hope this trend continues,” she said.As part of the keynote address, Canadian poet and novelist Margaret Atwood traced the journey of literature festivals from small gatherings in Adelaide to the mega events of this day and time.***Key eventsThe frontline club : A discussion by David Grossman, Christina Lamb, Don McCulllin and Samanth Subramaniam, moderated by Suhasini HaiderFiction and Economics : Arvind Subramanian introduced by Mihir SharnaLongform: Alex Shoumatoff, Raghu Karnad, Atul Gawande and Marie Brenner, moderated by Jonathan ShaninIndia at play: Suresh Menon, Anil Kumble, Ronojoy Sen and Baichung Bhutia in conversation with Sidin VadukutThe author was at JLF on invitation by Teamwork Arts
