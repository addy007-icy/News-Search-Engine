The Congress government in Karnataka has utterly failed to keep its promise of implementing development schemes in rural areas, Union Law Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda has said.Speaking to presspersons here on Tuesday, Mr. Gowda said that development works had come to a halt in the State, even as Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s government had failed on all fronts.Differences among Congress leaders were affecting the development of the State. Performance of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s government was poor and utilisation of funds, especially in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, was merely around 30 per cent, the Union Minister said. The State government had failed to develop roads in rural areas, provide drinking water in parched villages, release grants to zilla and taluk panchayats and take up drought relief measures, he said.Mr. Gowda said that elections to zilla and taluk panchayats would be a referendum on the performance of the government. Expressing confidence about winning more seats in zilla and taluk panchayat elections, he said that around two lakh eligible voters would reject the Congress owing to poor performance of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s government.The BJP had won more number of seats last year in the elections held for Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Same result will emerge from the coming elections, he said.Mr. Gowda criticised Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for staking claim on Belagavi, Nippani and Karwar in Karnataka.“They [Maharashtra politicians] always issue such statements for political gains. I had superseded the Belgaum City Corporation, when I was the Chief Minister, for their anti-Karnataka stand,” he said.Later, Mr. Gowda conducted a meeting with the BJP workers and requested them to strengthen the party’s base in Mandya district.
