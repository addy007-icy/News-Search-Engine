There was a mad rush for space to lay down the sheets and picnic baskets across parks in the city, with thousands of people making use of the public holiday to have some fun in the winter sun.The weather was perfect for a game of cricket, badminton, or football, and many families ditched the environs of malls and food courts to pack some brunch and enjoy the city’s vast green spaces.Those who came early enjoyed the privilege of finding parking and reserving an exclusive spot for the day. The rest had to settle in wherever they found space and enjoy the atmosphere. Food vendors and others selling paraphernalia keeping with the theme of Republic Day did brisk business and many joined in to get the colours of the National Flag painted on their face and posed for photographs to make their day memorable.Radha from Rajasthan, who was out selling flags and painting faces, did good business by carrying saffron, white, green and blue paints and giving the picnickers a makeover for Rs. 30.“I usually sell jewellery or bubble machines. But I ditched those today and still ended up making a lot of money,” said.Priya Khunger, who had come along with her family to Nehru Park, said her family usually heads to a mall on a public holiday, but decided to do something different this year.“Delhi has such beautiful open spaces and we don’t use them enough. The NDMC maintains them so well and more Delhiites should head out for some old-school fun and spend some time with nature in these beautiful spaces instead of waiting for food festivals or organised performances.”It was also interesting to observe was that each group of picnickers cleaned their spot thoroughly before leaving and put the trash in the designated bins.“At Lodhi Gardens, there is a bin every few meters. Despite there being so many people, the garden was left almost spotless, a major change from previous years when the parks would be strewn with garbage by the end of the day,” said Sanjay Arora, a Delhiite who has been returning every year for over two decades for a picnic on January 26.The evening also saw many visitors heading to India Gate, that was open to the public, and spending some time on Rajpath, that was sealed tighter than a fortress just a few hours earlier.“A selfie at Rajpath on Republic Day is priceless and its completes my holiday to India,” said Natalie, a tourist after posing with security officers at the iconic location.
