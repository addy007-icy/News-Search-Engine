The State government is sitting on the file of the master plan for Kozhikode urban area for the last five months.The 300-page final draft of the master plan, had been sent to the State government by the Joint Town Planning Committee (JTPC), chaired by the Kozhikode Mayor in August.It is learnt that the file is being vetted by the Department of Law. Hopefully the government clears the file before the notification of the Assembly polls, government sources said.Now this also means that the notification of the final master plan in the State gazette will take at least six months even if the draft was signed by Minister for Urban Affairs Manjalamkuzhi Ali for publication this week.The public will be given two months time to give their opinion and suggestions on the master plan.Then again a new committee headed by Kozhikode Mayor has to be constituted to incorporate in the master plan any suitable suggestions from the public.This has to be sent to the State government for ratification and finally get it published in the gazette, official sources said.Interestingly the Kozhikode urban area still relied upon the third master plan for Kozhikode prepared by the Calicut Development Authority in 1980.The Kozhikode urban area comprises the Kozhikode Corporation, Feroke and Ramanattukara municipalities and Olavanna and Feroke grama panchayats.The master plan has proposed mobility hubs at Malaparamba and Kozhikode Medical College, Information Technology parks and growth centres at Ramanattukara and Beypore. Three special economic zones have been identified at Beypore, landward side of Kozhikode Beach and Olavanna industrial centre.A key recommendation is that Kozhikode urban area should adopt a Geographic Information System database to provide data support for municipal governance.As many as 75 amendments have been incorporated in the master plan.One of these related to declaring Sweet Meat (S.M.) Street, Tali, Kuttichira, Thiruvanuur, Bilathikulam, Thamarakulam and Mananchira, as heritage zones.The State government has already clarified that restrictions imposed by the State Art and Heritage Commission will not have an effect on these places.One of the provisions in the master plan is a ban on entry of vehicles to S.M. Street, Customs Road, Palayam-Tali and Moideen Palli Road.Exemptions have been made on the height of buildings at tourism promotion zones and construction of buildings near water bodies.
