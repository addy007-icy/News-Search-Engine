A young woman’s partially-charred body was recovered from an abandoned park in South-West Delhi’s Dwarka on Thursday morning.The police said the woman was possibly strangulated before being burnt by sprinkling kerosene on the body. Prima facie, there was indication of sexual assault, but police will wait for the autopsy report before coming to a conclusion.The woman, believed to be in her 20s, was found near the wall of a park located in Dwarka Sector-5 around 9 a.m. A cowherd, who had gone to the park with his animals, spotted the body and called up the police.Hukam Chand, a local who was among the first to arrive at the scene, said partially-burnt clothes were stuck to the body. “Her hair and face were burnt the most, making her unrecognizable,” he said.A senior police officer said it was unlikely that the killer intended to burn the whole body.“The assailant possibly sprinkled kerosene on the torso in order to burn the face. The woman appears to have been killed elsewhere, then dumped in the park and burnt,” said the officer.Locals have been questioned, but the police have not been able to ascertain her identity so far. They are scanning CCTV footage from the nearby localities in a bid to crack the case.Meanwhile, just an hour after the incident and not very far away in Dwarka’s Sector 11, skeletal remains of a man were found hanging from a tree.A switched off mobile phone found near the body helped identify the victim.Rajnish had gone missing in September and purportedly sent a text message to his family informing them about his plans to commit suicide. He ironed clothes near Anjuman Apartments in Dwarka Sector 12, until he suddenly vanished. A missing complaint had been registered in that connection.An hour after the first case, skeletal remains were found hanging from a tree
