As many as 2,17,562 passports were issued in 2015 by the Thiruvananthapuram passport office, a press note issued here said.The office received 2,22,520 applications for passports that year; an increase of 21,000 applications. More than half of the applications were for fresh passports. The total revenue earned by the office in 2015 was Rs.36.72 crore. There was a fall in the request for police clearance certificates. A majority of the applicants was in the 19-30 age group, the press note said.Under tatkal/reissue applications and in respect of minors, where there is no police verification or where there is post police verification, passports were delivered the same day. In case of applications for fresh passports, where police verification is required, passports are delivered in 18 days, that is, the time taken for police verification in the five police districts under the jurisdiction of the passport office. The average time taken in Kerala for police verification is 25 days.Four of the five police districts follow the DPHQ model of police verification where the personal particulars are downloaded directly by the office of the commissioner of police/superintendent of police concerned. The Pathanamthitta police district is yet to switch over to this model. Once all police districts switch over to this model, the average time taken for police verification can be reduced further.
