The office-bearers of South Indian Artistes Association or Nadigar Sangam said on Sunday that they would initiate legal action against former president Sarath Kumar for not handing over proper accounts for financial transactions conducted in the Sangam during their tenure.Addressing a press meet, Nadigar Sangam president Nasser said Sarath Kumar had not filed accounts or related statements even three months after elections. “Since we are yet to receive proper audited accounts of Nadigar Sangam for 2014-15 and Nadigar Sangam Charitable Trust’s accounts for the year 2013-14, 2014-15, the office-bearers would initiate legal action against the former office-bearers,” said Mr. Nasser.
