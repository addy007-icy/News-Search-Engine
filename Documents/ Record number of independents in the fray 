They are lone rangers without any organised political affiliations or support. They do not have offices decked up with colourful flags, confetti or a crowd of followers to canvas on their behalf.Yet, they join the fray to test their luck with the ballot and a record number of independents have filed their papers for the GHMC polls too.Forming a major chunk, 939 independents out of a total of 4,069 candidates for the civic body polls have filed their nominations. The last GHMC elections held in the year 2009 had a total of 1,310 candidates in the fray including 540 independents. In the final outcome that time, three candidates — S. Dhanpal Reddy (Cherlapalli), D. Rambabu (Barkatpura) and Mohd.Wajid Hussain (Bholakpur) — independently crossed the finish line. Not surprisingly, during their five-year term, their allegiance got connected to political parties.This time, the highest number of independents who filed nominations is 27 from Suraram followed by 26 each in Gachibowli and Ramanthapur. The wards with high independent nominations also include 23 in East Anandbagh and 20 each in Balanagar, Miyapur and Jangammet. If the ward of Lingojiguda attracted 19 independent nominations, Cherlapally and Mansoorabad have 17 candidates contesting on their own.However, of the 150 wards that would be electing their local representatives, 17 wards did not have any independent candidates filing their papers. These include Erragadda, Ahmednagar, Vijaynagar Colony, Nanal Nagar, Toli Chowk, Golconda, Dattatreyanagar, Suleman Nagar, Kishanbagh, Jahanuma, Puranapul, Nawab Saheb Kunta, Santoshnagar, Kurmaguda, Chawni, Old Malakpet and Moosarambagh.
