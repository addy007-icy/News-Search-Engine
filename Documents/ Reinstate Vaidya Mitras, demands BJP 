The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Bharatiya Janata Mazdoor Morcha (BJMM) on Thursday demanded that the GO 28 issued terminating the services of NTR Vaidya Mitra workers be withdrawn and the employees be reinstated with immediate efffect.Vaidya Mitras play a crucial role by acting as the bridge between patients, hospitals and the Aarogyasri Trust. The government could impart training to them in nursing to make them qualified healthcare workers instead of sending them out, BJMM State Vice-President P.V. Vara Prasad said while addressing the media at the city party office here.He said that the State government had belied people’s expectations of job creation. “A majority of the NTR Vaidya Mitra workers have completed their graduation and already put in eight years of service, which warrants their continuation. But, the government is ill-advised to remove them and it does not think about the consequences of its action,” he said.
