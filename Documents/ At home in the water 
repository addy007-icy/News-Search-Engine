Water birds are the winged wonders who live in and around water. They are different from wading birds. Some of these birds prefer freshwater habitats, while others make no difference about their marine environments. Some birds are more terrestrial or aquatic than others and they have adapted accordingly. So, you may find some of them have webbed feet, bills and legs adapted to stay in water for long periods and also have the ability to dive from the surface or the air to catch prey in water.They can be roughly classified as seabirds (those that primarily feed in open oceans), coastal water birds (those that utilise the interface between land and both salt and fresh water, marshbirds (secretive, feeding in fresh water) shorebirds (found along the shorelines of oceans, rivers and lakes, characterised by long bills, legs and toes and waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans).However, some birds of prey like the ospreys and the sea eagles take prey from the water but they do not fall into the category of water birds.Some of the more common water birds are ducks, geese, swans, magpies, grebes, cranes, coots and kingfishers.
