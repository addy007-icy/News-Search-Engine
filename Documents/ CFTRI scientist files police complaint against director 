In the midst of the 103rd Indian Science Congress currently under way in Mysuru, a senior scientist in the premier food research institute, CFTRI, has lodged a police complaint against the director, accusing the latter of not only assaulting him, but also threatening to kill him.Chief scientist at CFTRI’s Food Engineering Department, K.M.S. Raghav Rao lodged a complaint with the Devaraja police station on Monday within hours of Pratap Simha, Mysuru Lok Sabha MP, publicly admonishing CFTRI Director Ram Rajasekharan to stop his alleged discrimination against Kannadigas at a function attended by Union Minister for Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan in the morning.According to the complaint, Dr. Rajasekharan summoned Dr. Rao to his chamber in the afternoon and held him responsible for the embarrassment he had to face at the function. The director apparently abused Dr. Rao and even allegedly threatened to lodge false complaints against him and put him behind bars. The director reportedly threatened to kill him, according to the complaint by Dr. Rao.Confirming the receipt of the complaint, a police official said investigation was under way. However, the official clarified that the complainant had not sought police security. “There was no request for security and none has been provided,” the police official said, before adding that the campus as well as the quarters of the official was being guarded by private security personnel.
