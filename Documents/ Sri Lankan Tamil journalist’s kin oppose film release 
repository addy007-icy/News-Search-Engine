Opposing the release of a Tamil film based on the life of a slain Sri Lankan Tamil journalist Isaipriya, titled ‘ Porkalathil Oru Poo ’, her mother and sister have approached the Madras High Court seeking to restrain the director from releasing the film.Isaipriya’s mother Veda Ranjana and sister Dharani on Thursday moved a plea to implead them in the petition moved by the film’s director, K. Ganesan, challenging the order of Film Certification Appellate Tribunal refusing certification to the movie.In his original petition, the director submitted that he directed the film based on the telecast made by London-based TV Network Channel – 4, on the final war between the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE. “I came to know about the Tamil News Reader Isaipriya through the telecast and I thought I could direct a Tamil film based on her real life,” Mr. Ganesan said.On May 6, 2015 he applied for a certification for his film with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Chennai, which was rejected on the grounds that the film is against friendly relation with a foreign State for depicting women in a degrading manner.
