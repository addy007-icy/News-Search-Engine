: Industries that are releasing effluents into the Hindon River will be sent notices and fined by authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar district, which decided on Thursday to crack down on polluters.At a meeting called by District Magistrate N.P. Singh, representatives of the pollution control board, the Noida Authority and the police were reminded about the need to prevent effluent from flowing into the river.Mr. Singh said that the Noida Authority was making sure that only treated water flows into the Hindon, but others along the river were polluting it. The Noida Authority had installed dustbins along the river as well. Officials were asked to demarcate the area along the river in their respective jurisdictions and maintain cleanliness.“If the industries are still flouting norms, strict action should be taken against them,” said Mr. Singh. Officials were told to remove encroachments from the riverside and carry out plantation drives to improve the green cover.
