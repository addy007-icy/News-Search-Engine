In the wake of the government making helmets mandatory for pillion riders, the Dharwad Chamber of Commerce has urged the Union and State governments to ensure the quality of transport infrastructure.In a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, chamber president Ravindra Akalawadi said that initiatives such as making helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders would not ensure safety unless the transport infrastructure was improved.There were instances of road accidents involving motorcycles due to potholes in Bengaluru. Along with potholes, unscientifically constructed humps and speed breakers, flowing of sewage over roads and frequent digging of roads for various works by government departments were damaging roads. In most cities, the respective municipalities had given least priority to address these issues.“Is it possible to ensure the safety of riders unless these issues were addressed?,” he asked.Every year, the police collect a large amount of money for violation of Motor Vehicles Act. In 2015 alone the government collected over Rs. 70 crore in the form of penalty from vehicle riders.The money thus collected should be utilised for improving transport infrastructure. Quality transport infrastructure would help reduce the number of road accidents, he said.Urging the government to drop the notification making helmets compulsory for pillion riders, they said it would lead to unnecessary trouble for the common man. “It is difficult to buy helmets of appropriate size for children and they will have to carry helmets along with their school bags.The government should exempt pillion riders from wearing helmets. It should conduct a survey to identify accident zones and make it compulsory to wear helmets in such areas,” he added.
