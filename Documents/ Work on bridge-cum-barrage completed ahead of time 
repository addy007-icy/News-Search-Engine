At a time when the execution of projects taken up by the government is being delayed, leading to cost escalation, a multi-purpose bridge-cum-barrage, constructed across the Kagina near Bhagodi village in Chittapur taluk in Kalaburgi district, was inaugurated six months before the scheduled time of completion.The bridge-cum-barrage at Bhagodi is unique in many ways and it not only provides irrigation facilities to more than 1,100 hectares (ha) of drought-prone areas in Chittapur taluk, but also reduces the travelling distance between Kalaburagi and Chitapur taluk headquarters by more than 10 km. Residents of Bhagodi and surrounding villages will have an easy access to the taluk headquarters in Chittapur and Kalaburagi now.Another feature is that it has been designed as an all weather bridge. It would not be submerged even during floods. The connectivity from Kalaburagi city to Chittapur town would otherwise remain disrupted due to flooding of the low-lying Dandoti bridge.The bridge-cum-barrage is considered as a milestone in the construction of such structures. Actual construction of the barrage was taken up in December 2014 and although the contractor had the time up to April 2016 to complete it, the construction was over in all respects in October 2015. The bridge-cum-barrage with 27 main piers and 54 dummy piers has a road carriage way of 8.6 metres and has a storing capacity of 0.252 tmcft of water. The government had included the proposal to construct it under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme in 2013-14 at a cost of Rs. 22.25 crore and administrative approval was given in February 2014.Construction of a series of barrages across the Kagina in Sedam and Chittapur taluk was the brain child of the then Water Resource Minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge after the State government gave up the idea of constructing a dam because of large-scale submerging of fertile land and lack of suitable site.The Minor Irrigation Department has so far constructed 13 barrages across the Kagina in Sedam and Chitapur taluks and has created a command area of more than 8807 ha in both the taluks utilising 1.48 tmcft of water.
