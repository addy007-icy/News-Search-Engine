The Karkardooma courts administration has restricted entry to the court’s premises for anyone other than litigants from January 11.The administration has taken this decision in order to tighten security on the premises. A fortnight ago, four armed assailants had shot dead a Delhi Police head constable and seriously injured an under-trial in court no. 73 in the court complex.“Entry to Karkardooma courts building will be allowed only to the parties to the proceedings, i.e., accused persons, plaintiffs, defendants, appellants, revisionists and respondents. No other persons like relatives and parokars [supporters] will be allowed entry…” the administration said in an order issued on Wednesday.However, in case a party to the proceedings is a woman/child/elderly person/differently-abled person, one attendant will be allowed entry along with him or her. Advocates concerned will issue passes for the parties. In case a litigant has not engaged a lawyer, he or she can get passes from the counters at gates no. 3 and 4.The court administration has also requested visitors to reach the pass counters well in advance on their court appearance dates for obtaining passes.Witnesses, sureties and other summoned persons will be allowed entry on the basis of summons and notices issued to them by the courts. Apart from the summons and notice, every party, witness and surety, shall also have to carry his or her photo identity or the visitors’ pass issued by the advocates or at the pass counters.Clerks of advocates will be allowed into the court premises on the basis of temporary identity cards, to be issued by the Shahdara Bar Association.The court administration has also asked security agencies to review security arrangements and provide adequate number of trained and armed security personnel for foolproof security in the entire court complex.
