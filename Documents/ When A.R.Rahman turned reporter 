Music composer A.R.Rahman had a busy Wednesday in Chennai; he had two events to attend – the audio launch of  Kanithan, which has music by ‘Drums’ Sivamani, followed by the single launch of violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan. The former is a film starring late yesteryear actor Murali’s son Atharvaa and Catherine Tresa, with both of them playing reporters. Perhaps inspired by what he saw there, the Oscar winner took on the same role in the event that he graced afterwards. Post the single launch function at KM Music Conservatory, Rahman surprised the audience by taking the microphone, saying – “Can I ask a question,” and followed it up with, “Ganesh, once this song becomes a hit and has 10 million downloads, what do you plan to do?”The violinist, who has played on many hits of the composer including ‘ Ennavale’ (Kadhalan) and ‘ Pakkadhey Pakkadhey’ (Gentleman), replied, “I hope that comes true. If it does, I will continue making music.”
