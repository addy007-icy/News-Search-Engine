Shortage of State-run ambulance services and dearth of trained paramedical staff continue to pose hurdles to emergency healthcare delivery and provision of maternal-child health services in the remote Agency areas of the district.The Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, had hired a little over 20 ambulances under the “owner-cum-driver” scheme to ensure healthcare services to people living in far flung areas of the vast Bhadrachalam Agency, and to provide self-employment to the tribal youths in the last financial year.The hired ambulances had offered their services in 12 clusters encompassing 38 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in the Agency areas of the district for nearly one year. However, the ambulances had subsequently ceased to function after the expiry of the agreement period last year, sources said.As against the total number of 41 mandals in the district, the 108 emergency service has a total fleet of 29 ambulances stationed at specified locations across the district.However, people living in six Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) mandals, including the Wajedu mandal, of the vast Agency in the district are bearing the brunt of the dearth of free ambulance services, leaving the needy to depend on private vehicles to reach their respective PHCs or Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam, sources said.A requisition has already been sent to the Tribal Welfare Department for sanction of one ambulance each to all the 38 PHCs in the Agency areas of the district, Dr Pullaiah, Additional DM&HO (Bhadrachalam), told The Hindu .As against the total number of 41 mandals in Khammam district, the 108 emergency service has a total fleet of 29 ambulances
