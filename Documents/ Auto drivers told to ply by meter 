City traffic police will file charge-sheets against auto-rickshaw drivers if they refuse to ply by meter.“If the driver was caught for same violation for more than two times, the traffic police can file charge-sheet in the court seeking higher punishment,” Hyderabad Traffic DCP-2 A.V. Ranganath said on Tuesday.Speaking at a counselling session held for nearly 300 three-wheeler drivers, who were penalised for refusing to use meter, the DCP warned that repeated violation would attract severe punishment.“The counselling is not meant for asking you to use meters for passengers. It is also an attempt to educate and warn you of the consequences of refusing to use it,” he told the drivers.He appealed to people to use HAWK EYE, a mobile app developed by Hyderabad police or Facebook page of Hyderabad police to complain against three-wheeler drivers not using meters.
