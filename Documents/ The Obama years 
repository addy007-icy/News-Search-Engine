Barack Obama started his presidency as the first African-American elected to govern the world’s oldest and strongest democracy (“Mixed legacy of the Obama years,” Editorial, Jan.14). However, an obscurantist opposition, with its divisive rhetoric, kept impeding his initiatives to reconcile conflicting socio-economic interests. His efforts to tax the super-rich to find money for the health and welfare of the weaker sections met with resistance from the reactionary elements. When it comes to his foreign policy, the biggest disappointment has been his failure to influence Israel to end occupation of Palestinian territories and create a fully-independent Palestinian state. The sad plight of the Palestinians went unnoticed by the most powerful office in the world and thereby hangs the tale of a tragic failure.P. Krishnan,Puttaparthy
