The Bajrang Dal, a youth wing of the Sangh Parivar’s socio-religious outfit Vishwa Hindu Parishad, has set a target of increasing its organisational reach in the country from the present 80,000 villages to one lakh villages within three months.Disclosing this to reporters in Bengaluru on Sunday, on the sidelines of a national convention of the Bajrang Dal, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Kumar Jain said, “We are in the process of increasing our reach to one lakh villages before Ramnavami (April 15).” On whether it will be able to reach this target within three months, Mr. Jain said, “The Bajrang Dal will not only increase its network, but also celebrate Ramotsava in one lakh villages on Ramnavami.”ResolutionMeanwhile, the conclave alleged that there was an imbalance in the country’s demographic identity due to the decreasing population of Hindus. It adopted a resolution, urging the Union government to adopt a uniform national population policy which bars those, who do not abide by the population control norms, from getting various government facilities.‘Ban madrasas’Mr. Jain also demanded banning of madrasas, while accusing them of spreading jihad. He maintained that Pakistan was in the process of banning madrasas, while France, Russia and Germany had already banned them.Sets target of increasing reach by anothfrom the present 80,000 villages to one lakh villages within three months
