The controversial Government Order that came up for consideration in the court, in a hearing related to the conduct of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls, had sought to squeeze the time involved in the election process from the usual 28 days to 15 days.Issued on January 4, the G.O. No. 5 incorporated an amendment to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act 1955, and had looked at completing the entire election schedule from notification to polling within just 15 days.Immediately from the day of publication of the notification, the last date for making nominations was put as not more than three days, irrespective of whether public holidays, if any, fall in between. And whether the day next to the last date for nomination was a holiday or not, the scrutiny of them was to be carried out.Only one day from then was allowed for withdrawal of candidatures and from the date of withdrawal, the polls were to be conducted within nine days as against the practise of within 14 days. The order, in a way, sought to reduce the usual time allowed between different phases such as notification to nominations, nomination to scrutiny, and so on.Though delimitation and other related works were already attended to, the notification of the GHMC elections has been waiting for completion of the reservation of wards. The government decision to squeeze the time frame for election process attracted the ire of the Opposition parties, which said the attempt was to deny them opportunity to finalise the candidates, since reservation of wards was not yet announced.
