Ridiculing DMK chief M. Karunanidhi’s statement on alliance for coming polls, ruling AIADMK on Wednesday said its archrival has failed to bounce back from repeated electoral defeats since 2011 despite a number of allies, and will face yet another rout in the hustings.“DMK lost Opposition Party status in 2011 (when AIADMK won), was defeated squarely in the local body polls and drew a blank in all by-elections and 2014 Lok Sabha polls,” AIADMK mouthpiece, Dr Namathu MGR.Hitting out at Mr. Karunanidhi’s recent statement that he will welcome any number of constituents in his party-led alliance in a bid to form a formidable coalition against the AIADMK, it said that people will not vote for it. Making an apparent reference to Mr. Karunanidhi’s invitation to Vijayakant-led DMDK, the mouthpiece said that the DMK chief and his allies would be “routed for sure” in the coming polls and that AIADMK will once again wrest control.Commenting on forming an alliance, Mr. Karunanidhi had said, “We will not say no to parties willing to come (into DMK-led) alliance. We will welcome any party which will ensure democracy’s victory.”The ruling party also slammed Mr. Karunanidhi over the ‘jallikattu’ issue, saying the bull-taming sport was banned by the UPA government in 2011 when DMK was a key constituent in the coalition, and questioned his criticism of the AIADMK government on the matter.
