In a rare move, separatist Abdul Gani Bhat, whose party Muslim Conference is a constituent of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq led Hurriyat faction, on Saturday praised late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed for his vision and efforts towards India and Pakistan dialogue.Surprising everyone by dropping in at the Fair View, the Srinagar residence of the former Chief Minister, Mr. Bhat said “Mufti sahib had his fingers on the pulse. He gauged the direction of the course between India and Pakistan, now getting closer to each other.“Growing relation between India and Pakistan is a tribute which I want to pay to the departed soul. It was a fruit of the seed he [Mr Sayeed] sowed in the minds of people, not only in J&K, but in India and Pakistan too.”In 2014, the Mirwaiz distanced himself from the reported visit paid by Mr. Bhat to Sayeed at his residence during the government formation.Mr. Bhat’s move to praise Mufti has come just a day after militant outfit Jamiat-ul-Mujhadeen criticised Geelani for sending condolences message.
