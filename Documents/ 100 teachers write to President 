About 100 teachers of University of Hyderabad (UoH), in a signed petition, requested the President, Pranab Mukherjee, to intervene and ask Vice-Chancellor P. Appa Rao, who is on indefinite leave, and In-Charge Vice-Chancellor Vipin Srivastava to step down from their respective posts.The letter that says there is a lack of “caring, concerned leadership on campus”, also states the fact that the administration put aside Rohith Vemula’s letter on December 18 with a request to the Vice-Chancellor to euthanise him and treated as ‘personal’ his suicide note, reveals the former’s apathy. The teachers say that Mr. Appa Rao, with his long absence from the university at the time of crisis, has lost the “moral right to continue as the highest administrator of the university”. Mr. Rao had also not found it “necessary to meet and console the five students who took shelter in a makeshift tent without proper food”. The letter also states that Vipin Srivastava, the In-Charge V-C, was the chairman of the Executive Council (EC) Sub-Committee which took punitive action against five research scholars, including Rohith Vemula. The teachers also point out that Mr. Srivastava’s involvement in the death of another research scholar, Senthil Kumar, in 2008 has already come under scanner. The President is also by virtue of his post the Visitor of UoH.
