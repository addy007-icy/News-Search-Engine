The Madras High Court Bench here on Thursday dismissed a public interest litigation petition filed by a lawyer based in Kanyakumari district, seeking a direction to the Centre to declare advocates practising in the High Court “privileged persons” and exempt them from paying toll on National Highways.The First Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice V. Ramasubramanian refused to entertain the case. “There must be a limit to all this. Why didn’t you seek exemption from paying income tax, house tax and so on?” the Chief Justice asked during the course of arguments.In his affidavit, the petitioner, E.K. John Victor Ellis (33), claimed that lawyers also did public service.Since MPs and MLAs were exempted from payment of toll under Rule 11 of National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, he wondered why advocates should be made to spend nearly Rs. 600 a day for travelling from Kanyakumari to Madurai for conducting cases.
