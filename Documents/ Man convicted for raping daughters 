A city court on Monday awarded life imprisonment to a former Raj Bhavan employee for raping his minor daughters five years ago. The man whose name is being withheld had threatened his daughters and raped them for over a period of four months.The man worked as an attender in the Raj Bhavan and lived in the staff quarters along with his wife and two teenaged daughters who were studying in a nearby private school. He was later suspended and arrested after a case was registered after his wife lodged a complaint with police.The incident took place in December 2009, when the manâ€™s wife left for Bengaluru to take care of her ailing father, leaving the daughters at home. A few months later when she returned in October 2010, she came to know about the sexual assault and lodged a complaint with the police.
