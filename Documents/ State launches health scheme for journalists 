The Telangana Government has launched the Journalists Health Scheme for cashless treatment of working journalists of print and electronic media and their dependent family members in the network hospitals for various ailments.Ministers K.T. Rama Rao and P. Mahender Reddy, Information and Public Relations Commission Naveen Mittal, Telangana Press Academy Chairman Allam Narayana distributed health cards to a few journalists to mark the launch at Secretariat on Friday. They also launched a dedicated website for the health scheme designed for working journalists.Officials stated that the journalists who were already enrolled in the scheme could login to the website -www.jhs.telangana.gov.in- by collecting their username and password from the I&PR Department. They could change the login details after their initial login.Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rama Rao said it was one of the most essential schemes for working journalists but admitted that there was delay in its launch, though Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had taken the decision last year. He asked the journalists who had already enrolled for the scheme to login to the website and check whether their and their dependents details are correct so that corrections could be taken up, if required.He noted that the State Government has taken care of all working classes by increasing salaries of government staff, Singareni workers, RTC employees, anganwadi workers and others besides taking the decision to regularise the service of contract employees.He asked the journalists not to get carried away by those who make noise with mala fide intentions and suggested to approach the authorities concerned, in stead, if they had any problems.The Minister asked the I&PR Commissioner to send a team to other States to study schemes being implemented for the welfare of working journalists.Ministers launch a dedicated website for the benefit of scribes
