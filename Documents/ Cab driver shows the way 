Raghu Kumar, called ‘Raghu Samartha’ by friends, spends his free time keeping the city clean. Employed as a driver with a cab company, Raghu uses his time off to sweep the street he lives on and then volunteers with waste management groups to keep garbage off the streets.“I spend a lot of time at the airport because of my job. The area looks so beautiful that I feel like it should be kept clean. I have also attended a few cleaning drives in Koramangala,” says the resident of Peenya. When asked what motivates him, Mr. Kumar replied, “I had visited my village in Doddaballapura last year during the rains. I saw a lot of fish that had died because of indiscriminate dumping of garbage. I decided then to support the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and started cleaning the place where I work.”
