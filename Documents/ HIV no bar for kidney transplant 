Diagnosed with HIV six years ago and with renal failure in 2012, Oaja (name changed) had lost all hopes of a healthy life.The 37-year-old Nigerian businessman got a new lease of life thanks to a multi-specialty team of nephrologists from Manipal Hospitals, who conducted a successful renal transplant on him two months ago. Oaja has recovered and hopes to return to Nigeria soon. The HIV positive status made the case a delicate one. His brother agreed to donate his organ.Addressing reporters on Tuesday, hospital chairman Sudarshan Ballal said post-transplant care for HIV patients needs expertise. “The patient has to be managed carefully to ensure that his body does not reject the donor organ and, at the same time, his HIV infection does not flare up. Besides, the multiple complexities of drug interaction between retroviral medications and immuno-suppressive medications need to be addressed,” he explained.Rohan Augustine, his nephrologist, said the post-transplant medical management of HIV patients, whose immune system is already compromised, is challenging as transplant patients have to take immuno-suppressants to prevent organ rejection.Mr. Oaja said, “There is a taboo attached towards HIV patients. My apprehensions were put to rest by the doctors here.”
