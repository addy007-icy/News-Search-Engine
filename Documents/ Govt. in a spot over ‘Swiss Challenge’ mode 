The Andhra Pradesh government which has zeroed- in on “Swiss Challenge” mode for selecting a master developer for the capital and other infrastructure projects as well, finds itself in a fix with the Central government’s expert committee clearly not favouring it.This is the second road block the government is facing in preferring the mode, that too from a friendly Central government, the first one being from within the bureaucracy.When a decision was taken six months ago, it would not have factored in these challenges from two unexpected quarters.But that is what exactly happened with the Kelkar Committee last week coming out against the “Swiss Challenge” method involving unsolicited proposals raising a question mark over the means to be adopted for choosing the developer for the capital as it awaits a big chunk of funds to flow from the Centre and a slew of other infrastructure projects.Kelkar reportA senior officer said the State government is yet to examine the Kelkar report and how much of it is applicable to the State which was among the first one to incorporate “Swiss Challenge” in a law, AP Infrastructure Development Enabling Act. Swiss Challenge is a method wherein the government puts an unsolicited project proposal in public domain and calls bidders to come up with better or improved ones within a given time frame.“Unsolicited proposals (or the Swiss Challenge) may be actively discouraged as they bring information asymmetries in the procurement process and result in lack of transparency and in the fair and equal treatment of potential bidders…” the Committee headed by former Union Finance Secretary, Vijay Kelkar had said.Apparently the Committee wanted to convey the message that favouritism was something intrinsic in this mode. Experts feel the party coming up with the first or original proposal will get first mover advantage with enough discreet hints from those in power. The Central Vigilance Commission too had expressed similar apprehensions and had said it should be an exception rather than a rule.But the new government has been consistently throwing its weight behind the mode though senior IAS officers and experts had their reservations.None other than Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu strongly favoured it at the State Cabinet meeting held in Rajahmundry on July 22. He said proposals for construction and development of the capital city of Amaravathi were welcome from experienced and competent developers from Singapore, Japan, China or any other country and that they would be considered on Swiss Challenge mode.Best optionFinance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu too defended soon after the Government Order approving Swiss Challenge was issued on May 3 and termed it as the best option and that the Supreme Court had upheld it. Another GO was issued on May 28, bringing more sectors under its purview. But now that the Centre’s expert committee has not favoured the mode, after an in-depth study for nearly 18 months, it would be interesting to see how the AP Government takes it forward.
