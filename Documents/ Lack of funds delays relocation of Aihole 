The long-pending demand for shifting the historical Aihole village still appears to be a pipedream as various hurdles, mainly inadequate fund allocation, are causing delay.Known for its exquisite and awe-inspiring temple built during the Chalukyan period, the village is inhabited by locals for generations.With many historians raising the demand for protecting and preserving the enchanting heritage which is gradually turning into a ruin, the previous BJP government had laid the foundation stone for shifting the village. However, since then, no considerable progress has been made in shifting the village.The village has 125 remarkable temples carved in stone in the Fifth Century. Having such magnificent monuments, the place is all fit to be declared a heritage site by UNESCO.
