The future of Patancheru Legislator Gudem Mahipal Reddy is hanging in balance with the judgment delivered by Additional Judicial First Class Magistrate D. Durga Prasad awarding two and half years jail and Rs. 2,500 penalty in a case related to attack on an industry in May 2014. Based on the witness and evidence, Judge awarded him the punishment. He was also given one month time to approach the higher court for appeal, which he did immediately.“The Peoples’ Representation Act Section 8 as amended by UPA-II Government, MLAs and MPs who were awarded two years or more jail term as punishment gets disqualified. The members get disqualified the moment judgment is signed by the judge. Despite this Act, Mahipal Reddy has been continuing as legislator. We have approached the State High Court in this regard,” said M. Raghunandan Rao, BJP leader from Patancheru.Substantiating his argument, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Bhanwar Lal, speaking to media at Mahanandi in Kurnool district two days ago reportedly said that notification for both Narayanakhed and Patancheru Assembly constituencies would be issued before end of this month. When reporters asked him the reason of Patancheru byelection, the CEO referred to the court case.Soon after the judgment, the Superintendent of Police B. Sumathi submitted a detailed report on the case to the district administration which was forwarded to the CEO.s However, so far no official statement was issued either by CEO or by the Speaker Madhusudhanachary on the status of Mr. Mahipal Reddy.Speculation is ripe that Mr. Mahipal Reddy would be surely disqualified and there are many aspirants from the party trying to test their luck.
