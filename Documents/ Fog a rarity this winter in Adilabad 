Adilabad has been deprived of some of its ethereal beauty which it dons in winter, the unusually warm climate being the spoilsport for most of the duration. The early morning fog in the hilly areas was confined only to those days when the minimum temperature dipped below 10 degree Celsius.The fog in the district is unique in the sense that it hangs over villages and near hillocks in layers giving the landscape a different look. The normal minimum temperatures during winter months here range between 10 degree and 12 degree Celsius in the highlands and remain a shade lower in the valleys.Almost all the 1,500 tribal habitations in the district lie sprinkled across the Sahayadri mountain range and each of these villages has between 500 acres and 1,500 acres of farm land surrounding it. The fog appears in layers due to condensation which forms just above the cropped area in the field which further gains in thickness owing to the smoke arising out of open air kitchens in the hamlets.Thick smoke billowing out of the rural kitchens joins the condensed layer of fog to hang over given places, including the habitations, and creates a heavenly sight. “This is one of the reasons for which we are proposing to take up trekking in winter in the hilly parts of Adilabad from the coming season,” said P. Shyamsunder Reddy, president of the Bellampalli unit of Youth Hostels’ Association of India (YHAI), as he talked about the YHAI’s activities in the district.“Most of the youth who were told about the beautiful mornings in the interiors of Adilabad were quite keen on joining activities like camping and trekking in the highlands here. We still are left with some of the winter period and hope to plan for such a trip,” he added.“A group of biker youths recently passing through made a stop near our village after seeing the fog in layers,” recalled Sable Kishan Naik of Koratikal (K) village on NH 44 Nirmal bypass. “Though I did not talk to them, their animated discussion centred around the beauty of the scene that is spread out on either side of the NH near our village,” Mr. Naik guessed as he dwelt upon the typical fog which appears every morning in his village.
