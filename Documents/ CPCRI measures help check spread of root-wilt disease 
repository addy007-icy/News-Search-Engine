Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research is adopting integrated management technologies to counter root wilt disease which has been causing wide damage in coconut farms.The strategy, involving a cropping system with participatory technology transfer, had helped restrict the spread of the disease, besides ensuring better yield in demonstration fields, P. Chowdappa, Director, ICAR-CPCRI, said.The productivity level of 150-200 nuts per coconut tree per annum could be achieved through upgrading management practices and technologies. The management practices include planting of disease-tolerant palms developed by the institute and adoption of multiple-crop system.Root wilt remains a serious concern for coconut farmers in Kerala and has been spreading to other States. Adoption of inter-crop pattern with the use of new varieties of coconut palms was demonstrated successfully in Bharanikkavu panchayat. Black pepper, nutmeg, banana, pineapple, and tuber crops were cultivated as inter-crops.“Raising different crops in the inter space ensures effective utilisation of natural resources, maximum returns per unit area and provides bio-mass for recycling,” said B. Krishna Kumar, head of ICAR-CPCRI, Kayamkulam.Systematic evaluation trials at ICAR-CPCRI regional station at Kayamkulam have resulted in the release of three varieties of coconuts, Kalparaksha, Kalpasree and Kalpasankara, with resistance or tolerance to the disease, he said.Bacterial diseaseStudies have established that root wilt disease is caused by the wall-less bacteria phytoplasmas.Phytoplasmal diseases are usually transmitted by insects.Current research on the disease is focused on development of diagnostic tools for early detection of the disease.From 1882CPCRI scientists said the disease was first noticed in 1882 at Erattupetta in Kottayam district. Later, around 1,907, the disease was reported from Kaviyoor and Kalloopara areas of Pathanamthitta district and Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district.The disease has spread to eight southern districts of Kerala, from Thiruvanathapuram to Thrissur and in isolated patches in the remaining six districts of the State.The annual loss due to the disease has been estimated at 968 million nuts and the monetary loss at Rs.3,000 million.
