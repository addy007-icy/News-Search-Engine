The Congress on Tuesday stepped up its criticism of the BJP government over its handling of the Pathankot terror attack, seeking details about National Security Adviser Ajit Doval’s meeting with his Pakistan counterpart, Nasir Khan, in Bangkok in early December.“After the cancellation of the NSA level talks in August, what was the understanding reached between Doval and his Pakistan counterpart in Bangkok?” said senior Congress leader Anand Sharma. A former Minister of State of External Affairs in UPA-I, Mr.Sharma said only the disclosure of the outcome of the government’s engagement with Pakistan in Bangkok would help the Opposition understand what prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a surprise trip to Lahore.“What assurances were given [by the Pakistani NSA] to merit this dramatic gesture?” asked Mr.Sharma.He said that the Congress was keen to know whether Mr.Modi believed that “The Pakistani establishment, including their army and the ISI, are for the dialogue process. What assured the Prime Minister that the resumption of the peace process had the full support and endorsement of the entire Pakistani establishment?” the Congress leader said.Terming Mr.Modi’s Lahore visit as a “dramatic gesture”, Mr. Sharma said the UPA government preferred “outcomes over optics.”“Now, this has been reversed by optics coming first. Optics have taken place in Lahore,” Mr. Sharmasaid.
