The declaration of vast areas within CRDA limits as agricultural protection zone is causing some anxious moments to land owners. The zoning of vast tracts of land as a protected zone rules out any commercial activity in these areas resulting in land value remaining low. The CRDA has made it clear that it would not approve any layouts, plots, and large construction in these areas.“The declaration of 56 villages in Guntur and Krishna districts as an area under agricultural protection zone has hurt the land owners. On one hand, the CRDA has taken away multi-cropped fertile lands for capital and now wants to impose restrictions on commercial and residential activity in relatively dry areas. We demand that the land owner should have a right to do what he wants with his land,’’ said CPI(M) district secretary V. Rama Rao. Citing the examples of Tadikonda and Amaravati, Mr. Rama Rao said that though these two towns have seen some commercial activity, zoning of these villages would force people to look for employment elsewhere.Spread of areaIn the three phases of agricultural protection zones, 56 villages in Guntur and Krishna districts have been included. The zones are spread in 5,440.26 square km and cover 63.23 per cent of the CRDA region. Under the agricultural protection zone-1, the CRDA has earmarked 44.41 per cent which is equal to 3,820.75 square km. In Krishna district, Vatsavai, Penugranchiprolu, Veerulapadu, G. Konduru, Mylavaram, Nuzivid, parts of Agriripalli, Bapulapadu, Unguturu, Nandiwada, Pedaparupudi, Kankipadu, Vuyuuru, Thotlavalluru, Pamidimukkala, Movva, Ghantasala in Krishna district have been included in agricultural protection zone-1.In Guntur, Kolluru, Bhattirprolu, Vemuru, Kollipara, Amruthaluru, Duggirala, Tsunduru, Chebrolu, Pedakakani, Vatticherukuru and Prathipadu have been declared as an area under Agricultural Protection Zone-1.The CRDA said it would allow only farming, nurseries, poultry, dairy, farm houses, fishing and small-scale industries like brick-making, lime stone and quarrying units.Zone-2 is spread over 1,137 square km and covers 13.22 per cent of the CRDA area. The CRDA included part of Jaggaiahpet, Chandarlapadu in Krishna district and Atchampet, Krosuru, Pedakurapadu, Phirangipuram and Yadlapadu in Guntur districts.In this zone, the CRDA would not allow layouts, plots and big constructions.The zone-3 is spread in 481.65 square km and covers 5.6 per cent of CRDA area. Kanchikacharla in Krishna district and Medikonduru, Tadikonda and Amaravati in Guntur district are included in this zone.‘No industrial activity’“The CRDA has imposed severe restrictions on construction in these zones affecting low income groups. People wishing to build houses outside village boundaries would be affected and there would be no industrial activity in these zones,’’ said CPI(M) capital area committee convener Ch. Babu Rao.
