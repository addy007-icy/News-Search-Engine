Stating that constructing a reservoir at Thoni Maduvu in Kolathur Taluk would irrigate 11,000 acres and also provide drinking water to 150 villages in Lakkampatti Panchayat in the area, Pattali Makkal Katchi leader Anbumani Ramadoss urged the State Government to take steps to implement the Rs. 118-crore project.Speaking to reporters after inspecting the waterway here on Monday, he said though the area was located near the Mettur Dam, severe drought prevails throughout the year affecting the villagers.The Public Works Department had prepared a Rs. 118-crore project for constructing a reservoir to store the water from the North Bargur Kappukadu and submitted the report to the State Government two years ago.“But no action has been taken so far,” he added.He said that 190 acre of forest land and 60 acre patta land is required for constructing the reservoir and permission can be obtained from the Ministry of Forest and Environment.He said that the project cost could be around Rs. 150 crore and wanted it to be implemented.The area falls under his Dharmapuri MP Constituency and the leader is ready to get necessary clearance from the Centre.Mr. Anbumani also wanted the Rs. 1,314-crore Mettur surplus water project to be implemented.“During rainy season and when the dam reaches its maximum storage capacity, surplus water is let into sea. The surplus water could be diverted to rivers,” he added. He wanted the State’s share of 25 per cent for the project to be allotted as he would initiate steps to obtain the balance 75 per cent of the project cost from the Centre.
