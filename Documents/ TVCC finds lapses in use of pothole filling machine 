Hinting at the misappropriation of public funds, the Technical Vigilance Cell under Commissioner (TVCC) in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has found several lapses in the filling of potholes using Python-5000, an automated pothole filling machine.According to the TVCC report that was submitted to the Commissioner and Mayor recently, the tender to fill potholes using the machine was awarded to a private company without proper assessment of its technical capability.The tender to fill potholes in 1,940 km of road network, including arterial and sub-arterial roads, was also given without any negotiations with the company, which is seen as a violation.Another major lapse that the TVCC found was that the tender was issued in the absence of estimate of funds required to fill potholes on 1,940 km of roads.Hailed as being the scientific solution to the cityâ€™s killer potholes, there were six packages in total in the tender and six machines of Python-5000 were to be used.However, the TVCC found that only one vehicle was used for nearly one-and-half years. While one machine was registered on November 30, 2013, two others were registered only in February, 2015. That apart, there are no documents to show how many potholes have been filled by the machine and if Python-5000 has been used to fill potholes on roads still under the defect liability period. In view of all these lapses, the TVCC has recommended stringent action against the BBMP officials responsible.Mayor B.N. Manjunath Reddy had directed the TVCC to look into the issue in October 2015 after questions were raised on the work done by Python-5000 and the lack of accountability.This was after a hefty bill of Rs. 15.2 crore came for payment, even as the city roads were still riddled with potholes.
