BSNL’s chief on Thursday conveyed to employees that they may not get their wages revised in 2017 if the company did not make profit “this year”.The current year is the most crucial for BSNL, Chairman and Managing Director Anupam Shrivastava said at a company event. After making losses for many years, it had made an operational profit of Rs. 672 crore in 2014-15 but still had to wipe out all the losses. The last turnover was Rs. 28,500 crore.“We expect that we will come back into black with net profit from 2018-19 onwards. Our salary expense is a whopping Rs. 15,000 crore. In 2017, the salaries are due to be revised as per the third PRC (Pay Revision Committee). Unless we are profitable, the salaries are not going to be revised. Air India and ITI could not revise their salaries in the second PRC. We have to make sure our profit and loss figure looks good this year and we are focussed on the revenue,” he told employees of the Bangalore Telecom Circle.The South Zone led by Kerala circle, he said, was the best. Loss-making Karnataka would return to profit by the end of March 2016.
