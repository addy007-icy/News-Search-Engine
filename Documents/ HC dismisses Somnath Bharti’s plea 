The Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed a plea by AAP leader Somnath Bharti seeking contempt action against the police officials for not filing their reply before a trial court in a case of alleged molestation of African women during his purported midnight raid in 2014.A bench comprising Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath held that a single judge of the court had correctly dismissed Bharti’s plea seeking action against the police. “The petition is dismissed as it is not maintainable,” the Bench said.Appearing for Mr. Bharti, senior advocate Ram Jethmalani argued that the trial court in its order dated October 27, 2014, after noticing 13 defects in the probe conducted in the case, had directed the Delhi Police to file a reply on the plea for further investigation in the case. He said that till now the police, despite directions from the trial court, had not filed its reply on the plea which was moved by Bharti.
