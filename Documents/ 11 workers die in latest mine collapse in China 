Eleven workers trapped underground in a coal mine collapse have died, authorities in central China said Thursday, the latest in a series of mining disasters.The miners were found on Thursday afternoon, a day after the mine in Shaanxi province collapsed, Yulin city’s propaganda department said in a statement. The reason for the collapse was under investigation, it said.The rest of the 49 miners who had been working in the privately run mine escaped. While China’s mines have long been the world’s deadliest, safety improvements have reduced deaths in recent years.But accidents continue, including one on Christmas Day in eastern Shandong province that has left at least one dead and 13 missing. Four other miners trapped in the collapse were located this week and efforts were ongoing to rescue them.
