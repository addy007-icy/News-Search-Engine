The manufacturing sector in India is not attracting talent as much as information technology and financial services do as it is seen as non-sexy, former Dean of Indian School of Business (ISB) Ajit Rangnekar has said.Speaking after inaugurating the golden jubilee seminar of Indian Institute of Packaging (IIP), an autonomous body under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, here on Saturday Mr. Rangnekar said the manufacturing sector was required to focus on ways and means to attract the talent by offering attractive pay on par with the IT and financial services sectors.Stating that the new era of e-commerce was offering enormous potential to the packaging industry, Mr. Rangnekar said every single product had to be attractively packed/wrapped and delivered in the era of online purchases. Both quality and cost were important in the competitive scenario and technology was the most effective tool that cuts cost in producing low-cost high-value products, he said.
