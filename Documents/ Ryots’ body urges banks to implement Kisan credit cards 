Telangana Rythu Rakshana Samiti (TRRS) has urged the bankers to implement ‘Kisan Credit Card’ systems so that farmers need not repeatedly move around banks.In a memorandum submitted to the convenor, State Bankers Committee, TRRS president Pakala Srihari Rao said the fact that more than 1,000 farmers were committing suicide every year in Telangana stands as testimony to the prevailing pathetic conditions being faced by farmers in the State.Mr. Srihari Rao, in a statement here on Tuesday, informed that the farmers were paying about Rs. 36,000 as interest for every Rs. 1 lakh loan taken from private lenders whereas the bank interest stands at Rs. 12,000 per annum.The TRRS chief said that extension of Rs. 1 lakh loan to farmers would save them about Rs. 24,000 per annum. He has also urged the bankers to sanction Rs. 50,000 for farmers as crop loan and Rs. 1 lakh long-term loan.
