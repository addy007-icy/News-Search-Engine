The Delhi High Court-appointed Justice Anil Dev Singh Committee for Review of School Fee has recommended refund of fee unjustly hiked by 53 unaided private schools in the Capital to parents with nine per cent interest. Of these, the committee has recommended special inspection by the Director of Education (DoE) in the case of 13 schools.In its ninth interim report, submitted to the Court last week, the committee gave its observations on 75 schools. The panel, headed by the former Chief Justice of Rajasthan High Court, made a special mention of 13 schools, which it said, had failed to produce their books of accounts and other related records.Constituted in August 2011, the committee has submitted its recommendations in respect of 1,066 unaided private schools of the Capital in its nine reports. It has concluded hearings in respect of 26 schools, for which recommendations are being finalised.In its report submitted on December 30, the committee said 40 schools, about which it made its recommendations, had sufficient funds at their disposal, out of which the additional burden imposed by the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission report could have been absorbed.“The additional revenue generated on account of fee hike was more than what was required to fully absorb the impact of implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission report,” said the report, adding that the development fee charged by them was not in accordance with the criteria laid down by an earlier committee.In respect of the remaining 13 schools, the committee found that they had increased the fee in pursuance of an order of the DoE, but had not implemented the Sixth Pay Commission’s report or had charged development fee without fulfilling the preconditions.
