The Telangana Telugu Desam Party has cautioned the people of Seemandhra residing in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area not to believe in the claims of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti that it is committed to their welfare and development.The TRS leaders who had threatened the Seemandhra people before bifurcation are trying to hoodwink them with an eye on the ensuing elections to the GHMC.“TRS leaders, Minister K.T. Rama Rao in particular, should clarify whether the assurances he is giving to the Seemandhra residents are on his personal behalf or on behalf of the party,” TTDP working president A. Revanth Reddy asked.Referring to Mr. Rama Rao’s reported remarks that the TRS is considering renaming the party as Telugu Rashtra Samiti, he wanted the TRS leadership to clarify whether they would change the name of their party headquarters, Telangana Bhavan, as Telugu Bhavan.He also welcomed the reports that Mr. Rama Rao was not averse to contest from Bhimavaram constituency in Andhra Pradesh, but wanted him to clarify why the TRS leadership had branded TDP as an Andhra party.
