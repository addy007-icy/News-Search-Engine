The possibility of having to do more work appears to be keeping contractors away from bidding for the new garbage disposal tenders floated by the BBMP. Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George said on Wednesday that there are many conditions in the new garbage tender, called to dispose waste from 95 wards. As of now, the BBMP has received bidders for just 35 wards, he said. “Unlike before, they cannot get their bills cleared without completing the work. This could be the reason for them not coming forward,” he said. “I have asked them to call for a re-tender for the remaining 60 wards. The process has already begun.”Responding to queries on the opposition from the locals at Kannahalli and Seegehalli, where the corporation has set up waste processing plants, Mr. George said unlike the units at Mandur and Mavallipura, the new plants were processing waste “scientifically”.‘I am not a receptionist’Mr. George flew off the handle when a few reporters complained of him being inaccessible.He said he is not a ‘receptionist’. “If I keep attending your calls, half my day is wasted. You call me when you are free. I cannot pick your calls at any given time.”When one reporter pointed out that the development works announced by the CM had not borne fruits, he shot back, “Will you give money from your pocket for government works so that work can be taken up sooner?”
