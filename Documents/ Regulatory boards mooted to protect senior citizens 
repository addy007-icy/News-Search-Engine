Regulatory boards should be set up at the State and district level as a supervisory and monitoring agency to ensure that the rights of senior citizens are protected and they get their rightful dues.V.K. Beeran, former Advocate General and the Special Officer deputed by the government to examine the issues of protecting the rights of senior citizens, has recommended that the boards, under the chairmanship of a jurist or a person who has held a Constitutional office of law, must have supervisory powers over the existing maintenance tribunals, social justice, and police officers who have been tasked to protect the rights of senior citizens.The recommendations have been made in the interim report, which was submitted to the Social Justice Minister on TuesdayThe regulatory boards will act as a safeguard for senior citizens, as they can seek action-taken report from the maintenance tribunals on specific cases. They can also ensure that the tribunals and the officials are discharging their duties appropriately. The board should be able to secure a judicial remedy for senior citizens if required, especially in cases which tend to drag on, Mr. Beeran said.Key recommendationOne of the main recommendations that Mr. Beeran has made is that Deputy Collectors be notified as presiding officers of Maintenance Tribunals, rather than Revenue Divisional Officers, who are mostly overburdened with the affairs of the district.At present, District Collectors are the presiding officers of appellate tribunal. District Collectors often have to chair over 100 committees in a district and hence a person who is/has been a Chief Judicial Magistrate be notified as appellate tribunal, it as been recommended.The Act says that every police station should maintain a list of the elderly living within its jurisdiction and that the list should be updated regularly.They should be visited at least once a month by the police or the district social justice officer and their welfare ensured. But this has remained on paper“There are also model police stations like Punalur, which maintains and updates the list of elderly and has been doing a commendable job,” Mr. Beeran said.
