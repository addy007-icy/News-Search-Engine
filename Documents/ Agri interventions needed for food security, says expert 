Food security can only be brought by agriculture and socio-technological interventions, Professor Kadambot Siddique of University of Western Australia, has said.He was delivering the first Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) Exemplar lecture organised by the Academic Staff College and the International Cooperation and Initiatives at the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, on Tuesday.The year 2016 has been declared by the United Nations as the International Year of Pulses (Grain Legumes) under the banner ‘nutritious seeds for a sustainable future’.“Grain legumes (edible seeds of leguminous plants) are currently underutilised in comparison to cereals in spite of their known benefits to agricultural productivity, sustainability and human health. Grain legume production is static or declining in developing countries in the face of an increasing global demand,” Dr. Siddique noted.He also said farming systems needed to be profitable and sustainable to meet the growing needs of country’s population and respond to the changing climate.Farmers needed to optimise the use of inputs such as water and fertilizers.Grain legumes had a significant role in cropping systems under Indian conditions because of their sustainable and environmental benefits such as reducing carbon footprint and the need for nitrogen fertilizers.They also provided nutritious human food and animal feed in both commercial and low-input subsistence agriculture, he said.
