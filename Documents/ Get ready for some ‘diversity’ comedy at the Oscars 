Comedian and actor Chris Rock, who will be hosting the Oscar Awards ceremony this year, is working on a whole new script and is planning to include jokes on its ‘lack of diversity’ controversy.“Rock is hard at work for the Oscar night, as he has thrown out the script I wrote and is writing a new show,” Academy Awards producer Reginald Hudlin told etdonline.com.“He and his writing staff locked themselves in a room as things got a little provocative and exciting,” he added. Hudlin confirmed that the 50-year-old comedian will include some #OscarsSoWhite jokes during the show. “And, yes, the Academy is ready for him to do that. They’re excited about him doing that,” he said.
