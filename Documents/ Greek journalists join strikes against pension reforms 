Greek journalists have joined lawyers, seamen and a range of other professions in a strike to protest planned pension reforms that are part of the country’s third international bailout requirements.Doctors have also joined in the protests against the reforms, which critics say could lead to drastic income cuts.Greece’s eurozone bailout lenders are pressing Greece to overhaul its pension system, which has been hobbled by high unemployment, an aging population and a 2012 debt restructuring deal that hurt pension fund investments.Thursday’s 24—hour strike has pulled news bulletins off air, while news websites were not being updated. Friday newspapers are not set to be printed.Elsewhere, ferries were tied up in port for a second day, while notary publics also walked off the job and farmers continued highway blockades.
