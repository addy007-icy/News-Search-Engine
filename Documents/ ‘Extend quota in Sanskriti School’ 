Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi has suggested before the Supreme Court that reservations in the Sanskriti School be extended to children of other government employees too instead of limiting it to wards of Group ‘A’ officers.“The Union of India had already filed an affidavit in the Delhi High Court in which we said that the school has been advised to grant reservation in admissions to the wards of Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ employees as well,” Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, who was appearing for the government, told a Bench led by Justice Anil R. Dave.The Bench has now fixed the case for interim order on January 11.The government and the school had sought interim orders in the matter so that admissions at the school do not suffer since nursery admissions began on January 1. They had challenged the Delhi High Court’s order to set aside the school’s policy to grant 60 per cent admission quota for children of Group ‘A’ officials, a policy the Court compared to the “erstwhile segregation of white and black students in the US and violated constitutional provisions of equality and right to education”.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is amicus curiae, advised a balanced approach with an eye on the fact that the school ensures quality education for the children of officers who are transferred or sent on foreign assignments.
