In the passing away of R. Srinivasan, the Carnatic music world has lost a pioneering savant who established the sabha culture at a time when there were only three prominent institutions to foster music in Madras.As the founder of one of the oldest sabhas, Nadopasana, Srinivasan personally took interest in promoting young talent and organising concerts of experienced musicians for the benefit of rasikas. Many musicians owe their success to the initiatives taken by Srinivasan and began their career by performing at Nadopasana. He was a respected figure and a composer in his own right. But he forbade musicians from popularising his kritis, but Maharajapuram Santhanam once rendered his Meenakshi kriti.He personally knew all the musicians and they responded graciously whenever he invited them to perform under the Nadopasana banner.Two years ago, at a function to applaud the sabha’s services, Srinivasan refused to accept the honour.The sabha ran on nominal subscriptions collected from members and was run on the goodwill of the musicians and audiences that included judges of the Madras High Court.Srinivasan was also deeply involved in organising the Thyaragaja aradhana at Tiruvaiyaru, taking care of every little detail.A silent activist, he allowed his work to speak aloud. A bachelor, Srinivasan was wedded to the cause of music, a true nada upasaka. His death has left a vacuum that will be difficult to fill.
