Officials of the Forest Department have launched a preliminary investigation into the alleged accident involving a captive elephant in which its forehead dashed against a concrete beam of the flyover at South Kalamassery on the National Highway 47 in the wee hours of Tuesday.The investigation is based on a complaint lodged by the Thrissur-based Heritage Animal Task Force (HATF), which stated that the 24-year old elephant Kunnathur Ramu, suffered serious injury to its head in the accident.The complainant also sought action against the elephant’s owner, mahouts, the erring truck driver as well as organisers of the temple festival.‘Truck had no cover’As per the complaint, the accident took place around 3 a.m. while the truck, bearing the registration number KL 30 E 433, was transporting the animal from Alappuzha to Thrissur.“The truck had no cover on its top to protect the animal from the scorching heat or downpour in violation to the Wildlife Protection Act. Despite the injury, they continued with the journey and paraded the elephant at Choondal Melkavu Bhagavathy temple from 11 a.m. to 8p.m. on Tuesday and from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Wednesday using a fake fitness certificate’’, alleged V.K.Venkitachalam, secretary, HATF. The forest officials, meanwhile, said an examination of the animal, currently stationed at Choondal in Thrissur, by a veterinary expert showed no such injuries on any parts of its body. “However, eyewitness accounts suggested the pachyderm had trumpeted loudly immediately upon crossing the beam but the mahouts are attributing it to the animal panicking on seeing the concrete barrier. As medical examination revealed no injuries, no cases have been registered though we are collecting statements from the persons concerned.’’, said Zen Antony, Divisional Forest Officer, Forest Flying Squad in Ernakulam.
