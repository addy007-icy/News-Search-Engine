Ganeshpahad villagers of Damarcheral mandal ferry across the Musi throughout the year to reach Wadapally, the temple town where the Krishna and the Musi meet. But, they have stopped using the boat to cross the river as it almost dried up since last January.The villagers used to walk across the river only in summer earlier.Due to the prevailing dry spell across the State, K. Ramesh, a villager from Ganeshpahad, said that they are not receiving water from either Musi or Krishna since last January due to lack of rain. The Musi river here has totally dried up.Though the Irrigation authorities released water from Nagarjunasagar to Krishna delta thrice, he says that the flow of water is not enough to use a boat. Since the Krishna river runs too deep here, some water was seen stagnated at one side where people scatter ashes of their near and dear ones, for which Wadapally is known for.Unless we get heavy unseasonal rains in the next six months, there would be no need to use a boat to cross the river, he says.The distance between Ganeshpahad, a tiny village with a population of 2,500 people, and Wadapally is just 1-km. If the river is in full swing, they have to travel 15-km to reach Wadapally via Damarcherla. Farmers frequent Wadapally for banking, post office and other works almost everyday.
