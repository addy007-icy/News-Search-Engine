Jagadish Shettar, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, has alleged that the State government has failed to address the problems faced by farmers and prevent farm suicides.He was addressing a meeting of party workers ahead of the elections to the zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats on Friday. Mr. Shettar asked the leaders and workers to work effectively to win maximum number of seats.He said that departments such as the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj and Social Welfare had failed to utilise the grants meant for projects. People from rural areas were migrating to cities in search of jobs owing to failure in providing works under schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act. Mr. Shettar alleged that only 30 per cent of grants released to take up projects for the backwards classes had been utilised so far, he added. He alleged that MLAs and leaders of the Congress were involved in illegal sand extraction. However, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had failed to take action against them.
