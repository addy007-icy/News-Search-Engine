Another powerful Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted by Maoists in the past was recovered from the Adava police station limits of the Gajapti district of south Odisha on Thursday.Lethality of this IED could be assessed from the fact that it contained over 32 Kg of explosive material that had been tightly packed in a large metal container. This IED was located at Paniganda during a sanitisation and area dominance operation by personnel of District Voluntary Force (DVF), said Gajapati Superintendent of Police (SP), Satyajit Nayak. Bomb disposal squad of the district and explosive experts of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) from Bhanjanagar in Ganjam district rushed to the spot for safe disposal of this lethal IED. This IED was suspected to be planted few years back by the Naxalites to detonate it in future.Earlier on January 10, security personnel involved in combing operation in the same area had unearthed another powerful IED in the form of a big tiffin box that contained around ten kilograms of explosive material. According to the Gajapati SP the IEDs safely recovered now could have caused large scale damage to civilians or security personnel.The IEDs being recovered in Paniganda are suspected to be planted by naxalites in 2009, when the ultras had ample presence in remote areas of Gajapati district. At present naxalite activity has got curtailed to almost nil in this district. In July 2009, naxalites had blasted the Paniganda forest beat house. Before escaping from the area, ultras had planted landmines at various spots at Paniganda and other places of the Adava police station to target police patrols that would reach the spot.In October 2015, two powerful tiffin bombs each containing more than 40 Kg of explosives had been recovered from Adava police station area of Gajapati district.
