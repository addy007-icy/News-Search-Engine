The protest by a section of the staff and students of Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) College in the city, demanding regularisation of the services of temporary staff and basic amenities for students, entered its fifth day on Friday.Their primary demand was service regularisation for all teaching assistants with University Grants Commission (UGC) scale and allotting classes for two teaching assistants who had been working on an hourly salary but kept out of work by the college administration. “Strangely, the BBA course is functioning as a separate department whereas MBA course is kept under Commerce Department. We want standardisation in the functioning of departments,” said P. Murugesan, secretary, Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teacher’s Association (MUTA) unit of MKU College.The students said that the college lacked basic amenities such as restrooms for students. “We also do not get bus passes or laptops despite being a university college,” a student said.According to Mr. Murugesan, the crux of the problem lied with the status of the college. “The status remains unchanged ever since it was opened in 1994. It is neither a university constituent college as it receives no aid from the university and manages the operation from the student fees, nor is it a self-financing college,” he said.When contacted, an official from the college conceded that the status of the college was an issue. The official, however, added that other issues such as non-allocation of classes to two teaching assistants were being blown out of proportion. “They were kept away for not discharging their duty properly,” he added.
