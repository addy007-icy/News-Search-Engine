The High Court of Karnataka on Friday ordered issue of notice to the State government and KIOCL Ltd. on a public interest litigation petition complaining that a luxury commercial health resort is being allowed in the limits of Kudremukh National Park area in violation of the law.A Division Bench comprising acting Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and Justice Ravi Malimath passed the order while hearing the petition filed by Wildlife First, a conservation advocacy organisation.Complaining that KIOCL Ltd. has subleased land with buildings to Alvas Kudremukh Nisargadhama for operating a commercial health resort, the petitioner claimed that the land in question should have been handed over to the State government after the Supreme Court passed orders stopping all mining activities in Kudremukh region nearly 10 years ago.Pointing out that the apex court had even refused to allow a plea of KIOCL Ltd. to use existing buildings and infrastructure for promoting ecotourism, the petitioner said the Wildlife (Protection) Act prohibits such commercial activities in national park zones.
