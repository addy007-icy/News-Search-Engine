A day after the Versova police booked actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui for allegedly manhandling a young woman from his building over a parking issue, the actor on Monday registered a complaint of his own against some members of the society for allegedly manhandling his wife.On Sunday evening, the Versova police had registered a complaint of outraging a woman’s modesty against Siddiqui, after a 24-year-old neighbour alleged that he had manhandled her.On Monday, Siddiqui went to the police station for inquiries in connection with the case, and while there, told the police that his wife had also been manhandled and intimidated on Sunday night.Mumbai Police spokesperson Dhananjay Kulkarni said: “In his complaint, Siddqui has said that five people barged into his office in Andheri at around 8:35 pm on Sunday, around four hours after the complaint against him was registered, and got into an argument with his wife Aliyah. He has further said the five accused manhandled her. We have registered a complaint of rioting and outraging a woman’s modesty under the Indian Penal Code and are conducting further inquiries.”An officer from the Versova police added that the five accused named by Siddiqui in his complaint include the chairman of his society, and the grandmother of the 24-year-old woman who lodged a complaint against him.Siddiqui has been embroiled in a dispute with his fellow residents over parking in his building compound.The society had issued a notice to him over parking his vehicle in a space meant for two wheelers.On Sunday afternoon, the 24-year-old complainant allegedly saw Siddiqui’s personal security guards forbidding a building resident from parking his two-wheeler in a space that Siddiqui was allegedly using without permission, and the complainant took photos of the incident. Shortly thereafter, Siddiqui is alleged to have manhandled the woman in the building premises.
