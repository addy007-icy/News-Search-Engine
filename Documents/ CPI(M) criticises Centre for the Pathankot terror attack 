CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the Pathankot incident has put a question mark on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of a “robust government.” “Mr. Modi claims that discussions with Pakistan have resumed. Then why are such attacks taking place,” Mr. Yechury asked here on Sunday. The attack exposed the “weak points within the security and intelligence,” he said.The Pathankot airbase was attacked by terrorists on Saturday morning and so far six security personnel have died and at least six terrorists were killed by the security forces.As for the political scenario in West Bengal, the CPI(M) leadership kept the speculation of an alliance with the Congress alive even though they did not mention the party. CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra urged all the “secular and democratic forces” to unite against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government to oust it from the State.“It is the duty of the Left to unify such forces on a single platform to build up a massive resistance against such an undemocratic regime. Those who want to fight against this tyranny should come forward regardless of their party affiliations.”
