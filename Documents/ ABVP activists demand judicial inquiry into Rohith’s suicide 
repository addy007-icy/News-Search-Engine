The activists of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) demanded the judicial inquiry into the series of incidents that led to the tragic suicide of a Dalit scholar, Rohith Vemula, in University of Hyderabad and punish the persons responsible for his death.Protesting against the critical comments against the ABVP on the UoH episode, the parishad leaders at Telangana University released posters on Wednesday. They said that Rohith’s father, Manikumar, also expressed doubts over his son’s suicide and only judicial inquiry could bring out the facts. Only those who were opposing Yakub Memon’s hanging wanted to see the whole issue as the clash between Dalits and anti-Dalits, and inquiry must also be done on the role of some professors who were behind the ASA and anti-national elements, they said, demanding that the unpleasant comments allegedly made by Rohith in his suicide note against the ASA and SFI be decoded. The parishad leaders also insisted on the removal of professors who were instigating caste politics in universities. ABVP State working committee member Ramana, TU in-charge Raju Rathode, president Mahesh, secretary Tirupathi and others participated. Meanwhile, the varsity bandh call evoked partial response. In a separate programme, the parishad activists took out a big rally and formed a human chain at the NTR chowrasta with the same demand.
