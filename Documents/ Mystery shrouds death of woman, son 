A 30-year-old woman and her six-year-old son were found dead under suspicious circumstances in a fire accident at Banda Kothapally village of Gundala mandal late Friday night. The deceased were identified as Gopadasu Kalpana (30), wife of Parasharamulu, and her son Abinandan. Alleging that his elder brother Yadagiri, sister-in-law, Bhagyalatha and mother Venkattamma set his house on fire to kill his wife and son, Parasaharamulu lodged a complaint with Gundala police. Kalpana had an argument with Bhagyalatha and Venkatamma on Friday night. In the midnight, some villagers observed smoke emanating from her house which slowly turned into a huge fire. The locals rushed to their rescue and rushed them to a hospital in Jangaon where doctors declared the boy dead. The woman was rushed to Warangal where she died while undergoing treatment.
