An exhibition of charcoal paintings of 21 artists is under way at the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi gallery. The expo, titled ‘Hues n Reeds,’ will be on till January 18. The paintings have been selected from the works of artists who took part in an artist camp at Kuthirakoor Kari last year. Kuthirakoor Kari is an islet in Kaithappuzha backwaters. The camp was held there to draw attention of the people to the problems posed by pollution.The low-lying islet could get submerged if the water level rises. The islet’s rich flora and fauna was in danger and the rare bird species there would have to seek a shelter elsewhere, said Joy V.A, an artist.The participants of the camp had depicted the agonies brought by climate change, with the rise in temperature resulting in an increase in sea level, drowning the dreams of hundreds of beings.The artists participating in the exhibition are Anil T.K, Asanthan, Babitha Rajiv, Baiju M.R, Biju M.R, Bijukumar V.K., Jayanthkumar, Joby Raveendran, Joy V.A, Latha Madhusudanan, Leenus K.C., Madhusudanan V.U., Nandan P.V., Rajesh M.S., Raju V.N., Roy C.C., Sanil Antony, Sivadasan K.C., Sunil Rocky, Sunil Vallarpadam, and Venu V.B.
