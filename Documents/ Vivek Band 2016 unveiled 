The country, which is heading in the right direction now, needs to battle evils such as corruption and crime and campaigns such as this one would help serve the purpose.While a State-wide campaign will be launched on January 12, “Vivek Bands” would be available across many retail outlets, said Samartha Bharatha in a release.It is aimed at promoting‘Be Good-Do Good’ during the birth anniversary of Vivekananda
