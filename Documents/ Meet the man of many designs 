“Kolam can teach a person a lesson in patience,” says R. Govindarajan as he connects the many dots into beautiful patterns. “In the end, a well-executed design can also give one a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction,” he says, happy with what he has created.For this 61-year-old, designing Kolam is another form of artistic expression. And his interest was kindled as a child.“In my family, I was the only boy who loved to make kolams. It was encouragement from parents and siblings that enabled me to make it a part of my life,” says Govindarajan, who has always been interested in fine arts. He also does oil paintings.During every festival, Govindarajan is sought by his family to make a big kolam. “I collected numerous books on dotted kolams and rangoli designs. Some kolams were just like the oil paintings I did,” he says.Then in January 2010, he saw the kolam contest being conducted by the Sundaram Finance as part of their Mylapore Fest. He registered immediately. “I was the only male participant surrounded by 100 women. But I was unfazed. People were surprised to see me make kolams with such ease,” he says. From then on, Govindarajan made it a point to participate in the contest every year.“I was working in the Middle East. But every year, I would come down to Chennai in January to be a part of the festival. This year, I have come back for good and am looking forward to the event,” he adds.“Designing a neli kolam is what is expected from participants at the contest. It is not as easy as doing a straight kolam. I have practiced many designs and I am ready now,” says Govendarajan, who has won the contest once.
