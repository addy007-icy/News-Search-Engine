Now a well-know advocate for rights of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community, 25-year-old Gautam Yadav, by his own admission, wasn’t always this confident a crusader for human rights.“I was never crusader material,” he laughs as he speaks to The Hindu about testing HIV+, accepting it and moving on with life.“Not so long ago, I was a frightened young boy in Class VIII, who left school after bullies called him a hijra . I was still figuring out who I was. As if the process wasn’t confusing enough, my peers troubled me no end. The result was that I dropped out of school, and with the little knowledge that I could get over the Internet, I launched myself into the world of dating and soon started having unprotected sex. Nobody — not even my partners — told me about condoms. I later tested positive for HIV,” he says.Gautam’s story, however, doesn’t end here.“There are little Gautams everywhere. And that is what scares me now. That is what has made me a crusader. HIV is here and uneducated children, who are having sex a lot earlier than parents are aware of, are exposed to a whole gamut of diseases,” he says.Speaking about the urgent need to talk to students about sex, gender education and healthy sex practices, he says: “When the Parliament can pass laws to treat and punish 16-year-olds as adult, it is also time that students are spoken to and educated as adults about AIDS. Half-baked knowledge is a dangerous thing. Let us empower our children with awareness.”He is also advocating for children over 14 years to be given the right to test for HIV.“The government should understand that early testing, counselling and treatment is key. Children should be given access to unbiased counselling, which is important. We simply can not allow them to be lost due to our callous attitudes, prejudices and lack of understanding.”However, it isn’t just these hazards that people living with HIV face. Though India’s Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) service model today is recognised as one of the state-of-the-art, activists say the struggle is not yet over.“There has been treatment stockouts and financial cuts to the HIV programme budget in recent times,” says prominent HIV activist Daxa Patel.“It is the right of every person living with HIV to avail of the best treatment, care and support services. India has had free antiretroviral treatment since 2004. The country is now facing challenges like stockouts of drugs and other commodities. We need access to third-line treatment and viral load testing. The government needs to reconsider the budget cuts that are affecting the programme. It is crucial that our government understands these gaps and works with us to address them,” she says, adding that being HIV positive and a woman simply doubles the struggle.“Social stigma aside, women who are positive have to fight even for their basic rights to children and property. It is an uphill task to access proper treatment and a life of dignity.”HIV/AIDS Alliance executive director (India) James Robertson said: “India’s AIDS response has secured real results, but we must not rest on these achievements. The epidemic is not over, and we cannot lose momentum.”Giving an insight into the efforts made by the government, National AIDS Control Organisation Deputy Director General (CST) A.S. Rathore said: “In 2004, the government started establishing ART centres providing free ART drugs to people living with HIV. There are now 520 ART centres all across India. Over 13 lakh people living with HIV are registered at these ART centres. Of them, nine lakh avail the free ART medicines. We have done quite well, but we need to do more and we are committed to ensure all PLHIV who are in need of the treatment has timely access to the treatment.”
