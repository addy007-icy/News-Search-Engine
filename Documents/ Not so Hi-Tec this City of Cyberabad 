It is considered to represent ‘growth’ and ‘modernity’ of the city, but Hi-Tec City can also take the lead for having a number of civic and social issues.Ahead of the GHMC elections, voters in the IT zone, which includes Madhapur, Kondapur, Gachibowli, Miyapur and adjoining areas, point out that residing in these localities is nothing less than a challenge with a host of issues dogging them everyday.Not quite appreciative of the previous corporators and local officials of their work, the local population hope that this time around their problems would be solved. At a time when women’s safety is in the focus, especially in the IT corridor, Divya Tatikonda, a techie and resident of Miyapur, feels some steps are still very much required.“Many wine shops have mushroomed in the Kukatpally and Miyapur area. People standing there create nuisance, and every time I pass through these roads I feel unsafe. Many working women have started avoiding these stretches even though they are on the main road. To make matters worse, there is no proper street lighting near Miyapur bus depot. Once I reach there, I call my husband to head home because I cannot travel alone from there.” Uneven roads riddled with potholes can top the list of woes of the residents.Be it Gachibowli, Kukatpally or Madhapur where most of IT employees either work or reside.There is no playground for the children in the entire area. Local corporators should immediately develop a playground.A.V ReddySecretary, Botanical Garden Walker’s Association
