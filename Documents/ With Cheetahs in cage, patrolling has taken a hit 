Without the right tools, a tough job gets tougher. This is true with the Bengaluru City Police, who have been struggling to patrol the burgeoning city streets. Reason: Of the 1,000-odd Cheetahs (patrolling bikes) distributed to the 104 police stations in the city, about 800 are defunct for various reasons.The personnel deployed on these bikes are the first to respond to a crime alert.This shortage in Cheetahs has resulted in police patrolling taking a beating leading to an increase in cases of mugging and robberies in the city.This has not just caused a major embarrassment to the jurisdictional officers, but has also burdened the ground-level staff, whenever the city sees a major crime incident.A senior police officer told The Hindu that Cheetahs play an important role in maintaining law and order. Scenes of police patrolling on these bikes would deter anti-social elements from indulging in any crime, he said.However, due to non-availability of these patrolling vehicles, the number of police rounds have been curtailed and this has resulted in increase in crimes, he added. “This problem has been persisting for the last four years …. to counter this, we clubbed the patrolling teams of two beats … the remaining teams have been told to arrange for their own vehicles or do foot patrols,” a senior police officer said. This has resulted in several policemen making excuses to avoid their beats, he said.With the City witnessing an increase in chain snatching incidents and the police beating system being under the scanner in a recent review meeting, the Home Department is now considering to sanction 1,000 more patrolling vehicles to the police force.(Reporting by Imran Gowhar)Home Department is now considering sanctioning 1,000 more patrolling vehicles
