“We don’t consider Karnataka as Pakistan,” said Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in Hubballi on Wednesday when referring to the long-pending dispute between Karnataka and Goa over sharing the Mahadayi river waters.At the inauguration of an international Conference on Enabling Make in India, Mr. Parrikar, a former Chief Minister of Goa, came back to the podium again (after having concluded his speech earlier) only to clarify on the issue at the insistence of BJP State president Pralhad Joshi.Mr. Parrikar said that as the issue was before the tribunal, he did not want to speak much but said that it was a drinking water issue and there should not be politics over it. He said that he was ready to facilitate a dialogue among the riparian States. “But the Government of Karnataka should initiate the dialogue process,” he said.The farmers of various districts of north Karnataka are agitating for the last over five months seeking the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the issue.
