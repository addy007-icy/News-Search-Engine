Sunday is a special day,For me to rejoice.Monday is the main day,I visit all my friends.Tuesday is a tiring day,With tuition and work.Wednesday is a warm day,To have guests at home.Thursday is a terrible day,With lots of work to do.Friday is a fresh day, For me to relax.Saturday is a social day,For outing and fun.P.G.
