A section of conservancy workers from Karnataka and Maharastra, who were deployed for solid waste management project in certain wards, complained on Monday that their wages for last month had not been paid. They also stated that water supply had been disrupted in the makeshift houses arranged for them by the agency which deployed them. When contacted, the ward zonal manager of the agency, which implements the project, said that the wages were disbursed on Monday and water supply was disrupted due to power failure.
