Sharath Chandra said.There are over 10 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and cases under the arms act pending against Bannanje Raja.However, the murder case of Srinivasa, the car driver of Agni Sridhar, is on top of the list, Mr. Chandra said.On July 1 1997, Bannanje Raja and his associates hatched a plan to kill Agni Sridhar.They fired at the car in which Agni Sridhar’s associates — Amanulla alias Bacchan and Mehmood — and Srinivasa, were going to a court for a hearing.In the firing, Srinivas was killed on the spot.The police established Bannanje Raja’s link to the case after they caught Arif, the cab driver, who was driving the van carrying the gangster and his associates.In the meantime, Bannanje Raja had managed to escape to Dubai and then to Morocco using a fake passport.He was arrested by Interpol early last year and brought to India.
