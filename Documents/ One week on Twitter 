One week after the Mumbai Police launched two Twitter handles for easy interaction with the public, thousands of people across the city are following them and have been tweeting to both, with various complaints and grievances. While the Mumbai Police handle, @MumbaiPolice, has over 16000 followers, the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s handle, @CPMumbaiPolice, has more than 12,000 followers.Both the handles have received complaints about prostitution, rash driving menace and lack of action on FIRs filed by people, and the handles have been responding to them by asking them to provide further details, directing them to the ‘web complaint’ section for a detailed account or to assure action. The handles continue to tweet messages deterring citizens from driving rashly or under influence of alcohol.
