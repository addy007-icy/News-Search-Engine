The Kerala Police Officers Association (KPOA) has expressed concern and condemned the attacks that were being made against police personnel.In a statement, KPOA general secretary K. Manikantan Nair said that the bomb attack at the police quarters of the Payyannur Circle Inspector posed a challenge to the rule of law. Such incidents went against the interests of the society, as police officers were entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring the security of the people.The association urged the State government and the Home Department to ensure that those responsible for the incident were brought to book at the earliest.
