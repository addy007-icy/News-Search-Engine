In a memorandum submitted to the South Central Railway general manager Ravindra Guptha, Nellore MP Mekapati Rajamohan Reddy has suggested the construction of multiplexes in the vacant land near the Nellore south railway station.Maintaining that the unused railway property could be of immense value, Mr. Reddy said commercial development would be greatly helpful in increasing revenues, besides bringing new facilities closer to the public.Mr. Reddy also sought the diversion of the Tirupati-Shirdi express, so that it would be useful for passengers from Nellore, Ongole and Guntur. On the Andhra-Rajadhani Express, Mr. Reddy suggested that it be extended up to Tirupati.He also wanted the SCR to make fresh proposals for improving passenger amenities at railway stations in Vedayapalem and other places in the district.
