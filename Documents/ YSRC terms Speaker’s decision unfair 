The YSR Congress has termed ‘unfair’ the decision of Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao to constitute a committee to probe into the Assembly proceedings during Zero Hour on December 22 as there was a no-confidence motion pending against him.The YSRC justified its claim by recalling that its members were not present in the House on December 22, while members were allowed to make a mention for less than a minute during Zero Hour. The proceedings allowing the members to speak at length during Zero Hour reflects the manner in which the House was functioning, YSRC MLA G. Srikanth Reddy said.He expressed concern over the leakage of the videos of Assembly proceedings and said the Speaker feigning ignorance over the issue was ridiculous.There was selective leakage of the content in which the reaction of the YSRC members was edited in such a manner that the main Opposition members were shown in poor light.“While the videos show YSRC member R.K. Roja’s speech, they did not show what provoked her.The unruly behaviour of the ruling party members was not shown. The selective release of videos of the proceedings is highly objectionable,” he said.The constitution of the committee on Zero Hour proceedings show that it was a pre-planned agenda and the panel would function as per the script.
