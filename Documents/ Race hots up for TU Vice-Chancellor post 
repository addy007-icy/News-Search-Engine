Competition for the Vice-Chancellorâ€™s post of Telangana University is getting tough with every passing day as dozens of academics are reportedly applying for the coveted post, even by Saturday evening, the last date for the submission of applications online.Since the government relaxed the duration of service for a professor to become eligible for the V-C post from ten to five years, the number of aspirants increased. After the retirement of Prof. Mohammed Akbar Ali Khan in 2014, the post has been vacant. As a temporary arrangement, senior IAS officer and Agriculture Secretary C. Parthasarathi has been serving as the in-charge V-C all this time.Though the competition for the post is high, only four or five are trying hard to bag it. They are making efforts through their own sources who are in a position to pull the strings in the government.The present Registrar Prof. R. Limbadri, former Registrar of TU and KU, Prof. Sailu, Prof. Sayanna of Physics Department in OU, and Prof. M. Dharmaraj, who retired as head, Department of English, and Principal, University College, are among the front runners.Prof. Bhoopathi Rao, who served in different positions in Osmania University, and one woman professor hailing from Nalgonda district are also said to be in the race.As Prof. Limbadri served as Registrar twice and belongs to Nizamabad (rural) Assembly constituency, local MLA Bajireddi Govardhan is believed to be making efforts to prevail upon Chief Minister to appoint him.In addition, Member of Parliament Ms. Kavitha is also said to have given him a word.Prof. Sailu and Prof. Dharmaraj, both belonging to the same community. It is understood that if the caste equations are taken into account this time, the post is likely to go in favour of BCs or women.
