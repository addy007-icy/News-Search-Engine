A spelling mistake has landed a 10-year-old Muslim boy in the U.K. in trouble.The boy, whose has not been identified, was questioned by the police in northwest England for mistakenly writing that he lives in a “terrorist house” instead of “terraced house” during an English lesson in school.The boy was interviewed by Lancashire Police at his home in Accrington, Lancashire, the following day and the family laptop was examined.“This was reported to the police but was dealt with by a joint visit by a PC from the division and social services, not by anyone from Prevent. There were not thought to be any areas for concern and no further action was required by any agency,” a Lancashire Police statement said.
