Evening walkers at the Chamundi Vihar Stadium watched in awe as groups of towering men and women jogged past them. At well over six feet in height, these athletes make for an intimidating sight. It soon dawned on the walkers that the basketball bandwagon was in town.The 66th Senior national basketball champion for men and women, which begins here on Saturday, returns to Mysuru after nearly three decades. A total of 53 teams will compete in this eight-day tournament, and it will take two indoor courts (Chamundi Vihar Stadium) and two outdoor courts (Mysore University) to accommodate the hectic action.In the men’s section, defending champion Uttarakhand and traditional powerhouse Tamil Nadu will start as favourites.India skipper and scoring machine Vishesh Bhriguvanshi leads Uttarakhand’s charge, aided by experienced shooting guard Riyazuddin. However, the squad will miss the services of Amritpal Singh, who is playing professional basketball in Japan.Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, will rely on a clutch of skilled players to do the job. Centres Aravind Annadurai and Rikin Pethani, sharpshooter Pratham Singh, athletic guard Prasanna Venkatesh and ball handler Akilan Pari form a formidable core, giving chief coach S. Bhaskar reasons to believe that his side can go all the way.“We finished as runner-up last year, but with the talent that we have, we can go one better this time,” Bhaskar said on Friday.Amjyot Singh, who starred for Tamil Nadu last year, is also away in Japan.The physically-strong Punjab unit, Railways, and host Karnataka are a few of the others who can cause a stir.The young Karnataka side, which finished fifth last year, will look to use fast-break speed to its advantage.“As the host, we do face some pressure, but we will try to use the crowd support to gain positive energy,” skipper and India power forward Arvind Arumugam stated.Among the women’s teams, Chhattisgarh and Railways hold a clear advantage. The latter has emerged victorious in 11 of the last 14 editions, while the former steps onto the court here as the two-time defending champion.Chhattisgarh's 6’9” hoopster, Poonam Chaturvedi — last year’s Most Valuable Player — could dominate once again, with Sharandeep Kaur and L. Deepa providing able company.The 10 best sides in the men’s and women’s sections have been split into two groups in Level-1, while the rest are placed in Level-2.The top-three in Level-1 will progress to the quarterfinal round, while the fourth-placed unit will battle the top-two from the Level-2 groups in the pre-quarterfinal stage.
