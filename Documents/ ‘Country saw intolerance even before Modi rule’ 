Citing the self-imposed exile of late painter M.F. Husain, film director M S Sathyu said that intolerance phenomenon was not new and that the country was witnessing intolerance even before BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014.After inaugurating Bahuroopi-2016, a national theatre festival here on Thursday, Mr. Sathyu said that a ‘world-class artiste,’ whose paintings had drawn the ire of fundamentalists, was living outside the country during the tenure of Manmohan Singh.Regretting that Mr. Husain had to die outside the country, Mr. Sathyu said that the country could not give him a grave because of fundamentalists, who are ‘super-censors.’“What would have the government done if M. F. Husain was a Hindu? Why this discrimination? He is a world class painter,” Mr. Sathyu said.He also questioned the need for a panel headed by filmmaker Shyam Benegal to revamp the Censor Board.He said that the country has already seen heated debates to incorporate changes in the Censor Board.Mr. Sathyu argued that film censorship was against the freedom of expression.“Though the nomenclature has now changed to Certification Board from Censor Board, its principles are still the same,” he said.Theatre fest beginsBahuroopi-2016, the 13{+t}{+h}edition of the national theatre fest was kicked off on Thursday evening with a formal inauguration programme.The fest is based on the theme ‘Expression, I sing as I please.’ Hejje Gejje , a street play, followed the inaugural function.A total of 11 plays, including Julius Caesar, directed by theatre personality Prof. G.
