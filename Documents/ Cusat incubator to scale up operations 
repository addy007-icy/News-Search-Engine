Buoyed by the government funding of Rs.1 crore, the technology business incubator of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), the Centre for Innovation, Technology Transfer and Industrial Collaboration (CITTIC) is all set to scale up its operations.After being set up in a 5,000-sq.ft. space on the Cusat campus over a year back mainly with the university funding, the incubator is now geared up to move from mentoring sessions and workshops to full-fledged incubation by next month.“We have already invited applications from interested students and a screening session to evaluate their projects would be held on Wednesday. Though we have space to accommodate 20 start-ups at a time, initially lesser numbers would be admitted,” said Abdullah. P, director of the CITTIC. An expert committee comprising representatives of the university and the incubator would conduct the vetting.Initially, the facility would be open to present and past students of Cusat and later it would be thrown open to students of Cusat’s 26 affiliated colleges.“Start-ups admitted can utilise the space up to a year with a provision to extent it for another year based on periodic reviews,” said Sam Thomas, Assistant Director, CITTIC.A governing council has also been formed to oversee the functioning of CITTIC, the first incubator to be set up by a university in the State.The 11-member council includes the Vice-Chancellor, Pro Vice Chancellor, three representatives from the academia, three from the industry, one syndicate member, and the director and assistant director of the incubator.Plans are afoot to give a boost to the incubator’s existing limited infrastructure using the government fund, which has already been sanctioned by the Finance Department.“The improved infrastructure along with high-speed internet connectivity, mentors in the form of learned professors, full-fledged laboratory and libraries would make CITTIC an ideal incubator. It would also spare our students from making trips to the Startup Village,” Mr. Abdullah said.
