Choked commercial centres in the central business district and the old pete area continues to be a nightmare for motorists looking for parking spaces. Ironically, parking violations formed over 30 per cent of the offences in Bengaluru in 2015 even as motorists await the much-publicised automated paid parking scheme.The delay in implementation of the scheme is due to lack of approval from the State government and indifference among bidders for the tender, authorities claimed.Out of more than 75 lakh cases of traffic violations booked by Bengaluru Traffic Police last year, offenses related to wrongful parking, footpath parking, parking at intersections and BMTC bus bays topped the chart.With the number of vehicles going up by leaps and bounds, parking has become a Herculean task. Finding an authorised parking spot is more or less a rarity.“We have booked over 21 lakh parking violations last year, including over six lakh cases against car drivers and over seven lakh cases against two-wheelers riders primarily on the arterial roads of the city,” said a senior traffic police officer.With public demand leading to annulment of paid parking (except at locations like Brigade Road and Commercial Street governed by traders’ associations) more than a decade ago, the State government, in 2013, announced the introduction of paid parking in the city’s Central Business District (CBD), which was to cover 56 roads.Status of the automated parking schemeFour bids were received for tenders for setting up hi-tech parking facility along with CCTV surveillance. The bids are being evaluated.A tender called in December 2014 had not attracted any bidders.“When we called for tenders once again in early 2015, we received a satisfactory response, including from a few companies outside Karnataka,” said a senior officer of the BBMP monitoring the automated parking scheme.However, such facilities can become a reality only after getting approval from the State government. “If the government approves, the tenders can be finalised within two months. Another two months may be needed for the bidders to install the necessary equipment on the stipulated roads,” a BBMP official said.
