ecommendations of the fifth State Finance Commission (SFC) for devolving Plan funds to l,200 local self-government institutions may not figure in the State Budget in full complement.Being a constitutional requirement, the Cabinet would have to discuss and accept the report and table it in the Assembly with an action taken report. Moreover, the recommendations should be included in the budget too.Such process had not yet been completed, sources said.The government is reported to be dithering on completing the procedures in the face of the Finance Departmentâ€™s objections against the award fixed by the commission. Since the Left Democratic Front (LDF) had gained a clear edge in the local body elections, the United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership too was not keen on expediting the process, sources said.AllocationThe commission had recommended to allocate 28 per cent of the Rs.8,500 crore (Plan allocation for local bodies) as maintenance fund for road and non-road assets, 17 per cent as general purpose fund, and 55 per cent as development fund.The Finance Department had advocated a drastic cut in the devolution, at least for next financial year, and freezing the recommendations till the government could tide over the financial crisis.Pressure is mounting to put on hold the recommendation to award Rs.8,500 crore for 2016-17 and fix it at around Rs.7,300 crore, sources said. The department top brass is understood to have advised to exercise a caution considering the financial crisis that is likely to intensify in the next two months.The government may not have adequate funds to meet even the committed expenditure and hence it has been proposed to defer the recommendations to award 20 per cent of the tax revenue to meet the functional expenses of local governments, sources said here.The Finance Department has also made a vain bid to persuade the SFC to include the Union Finance Commission grant in the award and to reduce its burden, but the commission refused to oblige. Local bodies will now get Rs.1,300 crore as Central grant too.ShelvedThis is also being cited as one of the reasons which prompted the Finance Department top brass to propose to shelve the recommendations. On deciding to freeze the recommendations, functioning of local governments would be seriously impaired, sources said.
