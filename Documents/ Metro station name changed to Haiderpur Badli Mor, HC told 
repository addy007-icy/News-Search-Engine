The name of the new metro station on HUDA City Centre-Samaypur Badli line has been changed to Haiderpur Badli Mor following the complaints made by commuters that it was creating lots of confusion, the Delhi High Court was informed on Wednesday.A writ petition filed in the High Court had taken exception to renaming of the Badli Mor metro station in Northwest Delhi to Haiderpur, alleging that the “arbitrary decision” was taken in violation of recommendations made by the authorities concerned.The issue had led to protests by the locals in October, when they gathered at the metro station and burnt effigies of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, alleging that the renaming had been done for the third time at the behest of area Aam Aadmi Party MLA Bandana Kumari.Petitioners Atul Kumar, Dinesh Agrawal and Tej Pal said there was no justification for naming the metro station after Haiderpur, a village situated two km from the station. The proposal to rename the metro station was earlier dropped after conducting some surveys, they added.In its affidavit filed before a Division Bench of Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, the Delhi government said the metro station’s name was changed to Haiderpur Badli Mor. The petition had named the Union government, Delhi government and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) as respondents in the case.The Haiderpur Badli Mor metro station forms part of the 4.4 km-long extension of the HUDA City Centre-Jahangirpuri line to Samaypur Badli, which became functional in November.
