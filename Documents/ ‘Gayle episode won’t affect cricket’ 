The ICC chief executive officer, David Richardson, does not think that cricket will be affected by Chris Gayle’s sexist remarks to Channel 10 journalist Mel McLaughlin during Australia’s Big Bash League match recently, but at the same time the former South African stumper does not shrug off the incident.Gayle’s offensive language to the woman journalist created a furore, with former Australian captain and television commentator, Ian Chappell, urging the world cricket fraternity to impose a worldwide ban on him.At a promotional event here on Monday, Richardson made an oblique reference to “the Gayle episode” when compere Shibani Dandekar directed a women’s cricket related question to the ICC CEO.Subsequently, responding to a query “if the Gayle-remarks-caused situation could have been avoided”, Richardson said: “Yes, it could have been avoided. But I don’t think cricket needs to worry about it. I think it (cricket) can easily move on from there.”Talking about women’s interest in cricket, Richardson said: “Our survey shows that women form 40 per cent of the television viewership of the ICC events and it’s much higher for Twenty20. It’s part of our strategy to use Twenty20 to engage more people. So it’s just not about women watching the game, but also about a worldwide audience seeing women play cricket. From a small number five years ago, now we have one million women playing cricket all over the world. The quality of cricket they play has improved tremendously. I am very proud of women’s cricket.”
