For the first time the banned activity of cockfight has seen a new high during the Sankranti festival, here in the port city.Despite the ban order from the Supreme Court and the Police Department’s strict vigil, betting activity associated with the blood sport had gone beyond lakhs.The punters had a field day, all along the four-day festival, and in some areas such as Arilova, Mudasarlova, Bheemili, Tagarapuvalasa, Anandapuram and Venkojipalem, betting values exceeded Rs. 5 lakh, on each bout between the roosters.According to a senior police officer, the vigilance was tight on the first day, but the guard was let down from day two, due to political interference.It is learnt that a couple of senior leaders from the ruling party had personally intervened and organised the blood sport at certain areas.A number of fighting roosters were brought from Vizianagaram and East Godavari and most of the participants were big businessmen and realtors, who played in high stakes.A police officer informed The Hindu that most of the cockfights were organised in private farmhouses in the city outskirts and despite having the information the police were unable to do anything due to political pressure.Normally, cockfights do take place in the district but the stakes are said to be small. But this was for the first time that the stakes had crossed the six-digit figure.'“If this trend continues, then Visakhapatnam will not be far behind East and West Godavari, where it is played in crores, in the coming years,” said a senior police officer.For the first time, the stakes cross the six digitfigure in theport city
