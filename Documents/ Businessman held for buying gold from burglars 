A 23-year-old businessman, Rajput Rakesh, who was running a fancy shop at Damaracherla mandal headquarter, was arrested by the Wadapally police for selling gold ornaments that were purchased from burglars. The police recovered 750 grams of ornaments, approximately worth Rs.19.72 lakh. Superintendent of Police Vikram Jeet Duggal said that the accused purchased a huge quantity of gold ornaments and sold the same to locals at much cheaper rate than the gold ornaments being sold in the market. During regular patrolling, Mr. Duggal said that the Wadapally police nabbed the accused on January 9 and recovered 50 grams of gold ornaments.
