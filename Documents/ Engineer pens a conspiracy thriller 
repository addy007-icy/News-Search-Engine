The library at the National University of Singapore, where I did my master’s, gave me ample opportunity for research. I met a lot of experts, including retired Army officials, medical officers and scientists as the plot involved war and violence,” he says.The book narrates the tale of a priest who belongs to the clandestine Brotherhood, a 3,000-year-old secret society. As the tale progresses, the protagonist upsets world religious institutions by going on a murder spree across the globe. “Through the protagonist, I actually tried to express my own doubts and enquiries about institutionalised religious manipulation and extremism, which is intricately woven into our contemporary lives,” Mr. Palliyani says.The writer, who has roots in Thrissur, was born in Saudi Arabia and brought up across the Middle East. After graduating from the Government Engineering College, Thrissur, he obtained his master’s degree from the National University of Singapore, where he works as a research engineer.Published by Leadstart Publishing, the book is already available on online platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart. The book will officially be launched at a function to be held at the Kerala Sahitya Akademi on Friday.
