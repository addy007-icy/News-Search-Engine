Bangkok’s main international airport issued an apology after a snake slithered into the arrival hall and wrapped itself around the base of a luggage cart over the weekend.Suvarnabhumi (pronounced “Suwanapoom“) International Airport, which was built on land previously known as “Cobra Swamp,” said it would like to “apologize for the incident that frightened passengers” on Sunday.A female passenger spotted the snake after placing luggage on the cart as she prepared to leave the arrival hall, the statement said.“After being alerted, security officers captured the snake right away and no passengers were injured,” Airports of Thailand said in a statement on Sunday that described the reptile as “a small baby snake” but did not identify the species.Snake expert Thanaphong Tawan at a Bangkok snake farm run by the Thai Red Cross Society said the snake appeared to be a Malayan Bridle snake, a non-venomous variety, based on a picture taken at the airport and published by Thai media.The statement sought to “reassure that clear and strict measures have been imposed to prevent all poisonous animals from slipping into the airport’s buildings” and it was believed “the baby snake managed to slip into the airport because it was very small.”Meanwhile, on the resort island of Phuket, a Chinese tourist was bitten on the nose by a python while leaning in to kiss it on the head while visiting a snake show over the weekend, The Bangkok Post reported on Monday.A video of the incident was widely shared on social media, showing the snake striking at the woman’s face as a loud scream is heard. Thai media reported that the woman received eight stitches and then flew home.
