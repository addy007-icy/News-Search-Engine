The gruesome sight of a body, charred beyond recognition till the knees, welcomed shopkeepers who reached the commercial area in Palayam early on Thursday.The body, found in front of a textile shop in a lane behind the Saphalyam Shopping Complex around 7 a.m., was later identified as that of Ahmed Sharif, 69, a native of Kollam residing at Pattom and an employee of a Palayam-based travel agency.According to the police, there was virtually nothing left on the body that could help identification, with a pile of clothes and a few papers near the body finally helping relatives and the travel agency authorities to identify Sharif. He was reportedly estranged from his family for the last few years and was living near the travel agency, sharing a room with two employees of shops near the agency. The two roommates, police said, had seen him around 1 a.m., and they reportedly found him in an agitated mood over some financial transaction he had with somebody else.There were a few people who said they saw a fire late in the night, but did not check it since it appeared to them like a pile of burning garbage, the police said, adding that the remains of a bottle found on the scene, suspected to be of kerosene, was handed over to forensic experts.Suicide suspectedThe police said it was suspected to be a case of suicide, with relatives indicating that Sharif had attempted to take his life earlier too. However, with a confirmation of this yet to emerge, other angles were also being probed. Initial autopsy reports suggested that he was burnt alive and that burns were the primary cause of death, the police said.The body was handed over to relatives, including his son Abid Sharif, later in the day. The Cantonment police have registered a case and are investigating.
