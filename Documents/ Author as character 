The importance of the Itihasas lies in the fact that they are first hand accounts, with the authors being characters in the stories, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse.Valmiki’s Ramayana begins rather abruptly. Logically, it should have begun with the birth of Rama. But it begins in Valmiki’s ashram, when Narada visits Valmiki. The latter then asks Narada who he thinks has 16 excellent qualities. He adds two conditions: the person should also be living at the time; he should be a human being and not a celestial or a gandharva.Valmiki has Rama in mind when he asks the question. He wants Narada to mention Rama as the One who has all these excellent qualities. Narada pauses for awhile, not because he has any doubt that Rama would fit Valmiki’s description, but because Rama has an infinite number of good qualities and He cannot be limited to just 16 good qualities.Finally, Narada tells Valmiki Rama’s story. Brahma asks Valmiki to write the story and says He will give Valmiki the vision to see how Rama walked, smiled etc, so that Valmiki can give an accurate description of Rama’s appearance too. When Valmiki starts to write, Rama has already become king and is ruling in Ayodhya. Lava and Kusa learn the story of Rama in Valmiki’s ashram. Rama had in fact visited Valmiki’s ashram when He went to Chitrakuta. So Valmiki was present in Rama’s lifetime and was a character in the Ramayana and also its author.Vyasa, who wrote the Mahabharata, also features in the Mahabharata. His presence is marked in many episodes of the Mahabharata. It is because the authors of Itihasas were observers and characters in their works that we attach so much importance to the authority of the Itihasas.
