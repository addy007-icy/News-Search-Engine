CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has said that the State government’s petition before the Kerala High Court seeking early consideration of the revision petition in the SNC-Lavalin case is the outcome of a plot hatched by the Congress and RSS.Reacting to the development here on Wednesday, Mr. Balakrishnan said the petition was intended only to divert public attention from the government’s attempts to thwart the free functioning of the Solar Judicial Commission and the ‘Nava Kerala March’ to be led by CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan beginning in Kasaragod on Friday.The last Oommen Chandy government had initially tried to trap Mr. Vijayan in the SNC-Lavalin case using the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), which was under Mr. Chandy’s direct control.When that attempt failed, it had sought a CBI investigation into the case, precisely on the day on which the 2006 Assembly elections were announced.
