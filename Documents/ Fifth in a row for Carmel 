Carmel Girls Higher Secondary School, Vazhuthacaud, has stamped its authority on the Chavittunatakam event at the Thiruvananthapuram revenue district school youth festival. On Friday, a performance revolving around how faith in god helps a king Carlsman to overcome the cruel ruler Ouderman took the team to victory for the fifth consecutive time. The girls — A. Arundhati Nair, Lakshmi R.S., Aarcha B. Jayan, Pooja S. Ajith, Ann Mary Varghese, Jithi V.B., Gopika Prasad, Vismaya V.S., Devi H. Nair, and Aishwarya L.R. — were taking part in the event for the first time and were over the moon at taking the top slot.They also felt some pressure; after all the school had a great track record in the event at the fete.But five months of practice — two hours in the beginning later stretched to the entire day — under the supervision of two experts saw them through. The costumes that hint at medieval European attire, wigs, painted faces, and the stamping routine had left the students short of breath, but the top position was worth every bit of effort, they say.
