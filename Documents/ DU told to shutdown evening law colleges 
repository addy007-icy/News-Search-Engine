The Bar Council of India (BCI) has asked Delhi University to shutdown colleges offering law courses in evening shifts, saying such programmes does not ensure proper quality of legal education.Taking into account that proper quality of legal education cannot be ensured if classes are run during evening and night hours, the Bar Council of India has taken a policy decision to dispense with the evening colleges.“Two of your law colleges are offering classes beyond 9 PM which is in violation of the BCI directive...whatever may have been the reason for running these colleges, the same cannot be permitted henceforth,” a BCI communication sent to DU said. In an unprecedented move, the BCI, the apex regulatory body for legal education and legal profession in India, had in 2014 decided to derecognise DU’s law course after it failed to seek timely extension of the affiliation of its three centres, namely Campus Law Centre, Law Centre-I and Law Centre-II.— PTI
