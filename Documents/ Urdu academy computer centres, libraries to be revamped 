Acting on complaints of ‘irregularities’ against the Telangana State Urdu Academy, the State Minority Department plans to change management of computer centres and libraries currently being run by the academy.Syed Omer Jaleel, Special Secretary, Minorities Welfare Department, issued orders to the academy’s director recently asking him to hand over 43 computer training centres and 30 Urdu libraries managed by the academy across the State to the State Minorities Finance Corporation (SMFC).Of them, 12 computer centres and nine libraries exist in Hyderabad.The SMFC plans to revamp the centres and utilise it for conducting coaching programmes for minority students appearing for competitive examinations, spoken English classes and computer training.“It will be converted into learning centres. Our aim is to reach the minorities in the old city and start programmes that have local demand,” TSMFC, Managing Director, B. Shafiullah told The Hindu adding that if need arose new centres would also be opened after obtaining clearance from the government.The shift follows a spate of complaints against the officials of Urdu Academy regarding handling of the facilities. During a recent inspection conducted by TSMFC officials, it was found that the centres were serving little purpose and the management was not performing efficiently.“At two centres, the locals informed that the libraries were not being opened for weeks at a stretch.Moreover, at a computer centre there are no students but the faculty is drawing salaries,” an official revealed adding that they had submitted a report to the authorities concerned.According to sources, the academy has yet not officially handed over the centres to SMFC. Every month, around Rs. 30 lakh is spent on payment of salaries of librarians and computer instructors, newspapers, periodicals and rents.
