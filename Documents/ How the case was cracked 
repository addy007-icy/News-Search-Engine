One of the clues that led the police to zero in on Rajan and his accomplices in the triple murder case of Rajinder Nagar was the manner in which the victims were killed.The previous murder of a woman for which Rajan was serving jail — where he met the now deceased Sanjay Sonaria — was also an incident where the victim was strangulated in the same way as the property dealer. The victim in that case was the woman who was persistent on lodging a police complaint in Dwarka after Rajan refused to marry her, said a senior police officer. “Initially we were confused because of the long list of cases Sanjay had against him, throwing up many possibilities and making all those allegedly cheated by him suspects. While we were probing the list it came to our notice that Sanjay had served jail as well. We called for a list of fellow inmates and the manner in which Sanjay was murdered pointed the needle of suspicion towards Rajan,” said the officer. He added that call records were then checked and it was found that Rajan was in constant touch with Sanjay and had even visited Rajinder Nagar on the day of the murder. He and others were held from different parts of Delhi and Western Uttar Pradesh.During interrogation, Rajan is learnt to have told the police that the amount they took away from Sanjay’s residence was far less than what they had hoped for.“Initially, all those who were roped in were promised Rs. 1 lakh each but later Rajan had second thoughts and wanted to keep most of the robbed amount himself, which enraged the co-accused,” said a source. It is also learnt that when the accused reached Pawan’s room, they used the remote to increase the volume of the TV, which made Pawan a little suspicious. But before he could put up a fight, he was overpowered and murdered.
