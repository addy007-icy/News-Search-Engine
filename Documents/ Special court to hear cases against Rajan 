The Bombay High Court administration has designated a court to hear all the cases against underworld don Chhota Rajan in Mumbai, Mangesh Patil, Registrar General of the HC, told The Hindu on Monday.“A request was made by the state government to the HC administration before the court broke for Christmas vacation (December 23) and the approval for the same was also granted then,” he said.“Judge SS Adkar who sits at the City Civil and Sessions Court will hear the cases,” Mr Patil said.Judge Adkar was earlier a district and additional sessions judge at Wardha. When asked when the court expected to start taking up all the cases, Mr Patil said, “We don’t know, procedures are due and can’t say how much time it will take”.Rajan is expected to be brought to the city from Delhi on January 7, as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court has issued a production warrant against him in connection with the murder of journalist J Dey in 2011.The Maharashtra police have a total of 71 cases registered against Rajan, of which 68 are in Mumbai, two in Navi Mumbai and one in Pune.
