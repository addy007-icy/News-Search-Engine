Each of the units has an average worker strength of 10 to 15.Business at the garments cluster has already received big attention with its success and being located close to the international airport at Nedumbassery is expected to boost business for the cluster.Establishment of the park will also give a boost to its export business.The garments cluster now directly exports shirts to Oman.
