Acharya Nagarjuna University will team up with Satish Dhawan Space Centre- Indian Space Research Organisation (SDSC-ISRO) to develop a multiple object tracking software (MOTR) with functions ranging from missile tracking in defence to tracking of flight paths in airports.The ANU has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SDSC-SHAR to design the MOTR and it is the first university in the country to have a tie-up with SDSC-SHAR in designing indigenous radars. India is the fourth nation in the world, after the US, Japan and Germany to design MOTR, Principal, University College of Engineering, P. Siddhaih said.He said that the ANU has been granted the project estimated to cost Rs.30 lakh with which it would provide high frequency structural simulator software.“The software can also be used in tracking of submarine and satellite launching. We are using the Electron Beam Steering Technique for tracking of objects,’’ Dr. Siddhaiah told The Hindu on Monday.The ANU would also collaborate with ISRO to implement high gain antennas and a radar system which would be simulated with the help of high-end work stations, Dr. Siddhaih added.The electron beam steering would ensure that the antenna could be moved by electron beams.Appreciating the efforts of Dr. Siddhaih in bagging the prestigious project, ANU Vice-Chancellor V.S.S. Kumar said that the university would extend its support to all research activities in science and technology.University engineering college principal P. Siddhaih says the software can also be used in tracking of submarine and satellite launching
