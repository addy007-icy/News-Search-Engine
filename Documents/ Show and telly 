Netflix, the American internet streaming giant has finally launched in India. Netflix is a subscription-based service, and it currently offers three levels — Basic, at Rs. 500 a month, Standard, at Rs.650 and Premium at Rs. 800. However, the platform allows you to try the service first by making the first month free. Apart from international television shows and movies, the website also has on offer its critically acclaimed, original shows.Here are five shows which you should consider adding on your Netflix list (Spoiler: House of Cards hasn’t been released for the Indian audience).Daredevil — Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight changed the genre of superhero films. Daredevil does the same for television. Dark, gritty, suspenseful, this superbly paced show about a blind superhero will leave you wanting more.Grace and Frankie — Instead of announcing their retirement, Grace and Frankie’s respective husbands declare their love for each other. This heartwarming and hilarious story boasts an all-star cast, including the likes of Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen, and is produced by Marta Kauffman, the co-creator of the smash hit, Friends.Ship of Theseus — The regional selection of films in Netflix is sparse (and dated), but while we wait for more films, watch Ship of Theseus, a beautiful and impactful film which connects the lives of five, very diverse individuals.Master of None — A comedy series which follows the life of first-generation immigrant, Dev Shah, and his everyday struggles. Aziz Ansari injects the mundane with humour and heart.Archer — A raunchy and slapstick cartoon satire about a spy who’s greatest nemesis is his boss, who is also his mother. If you like The Simpsons and Family Guy, you will love Archer.
