Like everyday, Poonam Devi on Wednesday, went to fetch her son Ankit from school. But, the boy was nowhere to be seen. A huge crowd outside the school made her curious.When she went ahead and enquired, she found out that a child had been taken to the hospital after he fell into an open septic tank. It was Ankit.Family members recalled the sequence and blamed the school for not just failing to prevent the incident but also failing to inform the family about it.Talking to The Hindu , Ankit’s uncle Suresh said the family, which was preparing for Ankit’s fifth birthday less than two months from now, was shattered by the loss, which could have well been prevented if only the school sensed the risk of an open septic tank.“Being the younger of the two brothers, Ankit was very dear to his parents Poonam and Rajesh Kumar Singh and even to extended members of the family,” said Mr. Suresh who is married to Rajesh’s sister. He added that the school would have delayed further had the child's mother not gone to school.A similar allegation was made by an official of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation who said that the School Inspector of the region was told that all other students and teachers had gone to attend a science exhibition and only found out about Ankit’s death when they returned.The police are probing all the allegations.Four-year-old Ankit’s fifth birthday wasless than two months away
