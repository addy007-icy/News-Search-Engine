A team from IIT-Madras has won the second place at Enable Makeathon, with an add-on device to convert a manual wheelchair into an outdoor-mobility device. The award was given on Saturday in the form of seed money to the tune of $ 15,000.Enable Makeathon, a project initiated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, saw persons with disabilities, engineers, designers, manufacturers, entrepreneurs and others collaborate to create sustainable and affordable solutions to the problems faced by persons with disabilities in rural areas, a note about the event said. The event was held in Bengaluru, with a total of 135 teams registering for it.Vivek Sarda and Swostik Dash, both research staff members at the R2D2 lab at IIT-Madras, along with Ashish Sharma, a final-year student, worked for two months on the device.“Most people with disabilities here use wheelchairs with four wheels, which are bad for travelling outdoors. Tricycles can be used outdoors but are too big indoors. So we came up with an add-on device, which, in two seconds, can covert the wheelchair into a tricycle – with the front two wheels lifting up and an additional wheel getting attached,” said Vivek Sarda.The three are now planning to conduct extensive field testing on the device and looking for collaborators. “After the testing, we are hoping to get the device to users,” said Vivek Sarda. The goal, he said, is to set up a company to develop technology that could have an impact on the lives of persons with disabilities.The award was given in the form of seed moneyto the tune of$ 15,000
