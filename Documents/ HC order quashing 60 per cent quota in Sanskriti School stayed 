The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Delhi High Court order quashing 60 per cent quota in the prestigious Sanskriti School meant exclusively for wards of group A officers on the condition that this reservation will now be made open to the children of all transferrable employees as an interim measure for the coming academic year.The three-judge Bench of Justices Anil R. Dave, C. Nagappan and A.K. Goel however clarified that it was not taking into consideration at present, the notification issued by Delhi government quashing the management quota in all schools.The Apex court also admitted the appeals filed by Sanskriti School and the Centre against the Delhi High Court judgment. The Bench also took note of the submission that Sanskriti School and the Centre should clearly come out with a scheme to categorise seats when the appeals will be taken up for hearing on April 6. The Court gave six weeks to the respondents to file their response to the challenge posed by the school and the Centre to the High Courtâ€™s judgment.The Bench will now decide on the larger constitutional question as to whether the society running the school can be held as a State and made amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the Apex court and the High Court.
