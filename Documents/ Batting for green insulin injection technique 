“Go green, stay fit” is the latest mantra being advocated by the Forum for Injection Technique (FIT) India. And here is why they are advocating it.According to estimates released by the Forum, the net amount of plastic generated from insulin syringes alone, each year, is 6,00,000 kg. This is excluding the plastic generated from over 40 million pen needles used every year in India.What is adding to the woes is the fact that most of these devices are not disposed off safely, subjecting both the caretaker and the community to health risks“There are over 200 million insulin delivery devices generated in India each year. Approximately 65 million Indians living with diabetes consume about 160 million insulin syringes and about 50 million pen needles annually, along with about 40 million syringes used for immunisation. Most of these devices are disposed of under unsafe circumstances,” noted an article on “Green Diabetology”, published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism recently. The article called for urgent need for proper disposal of insulin delivery sharp devices.Meanwhile, besides this, 9.6 crore vials, cartridges and pre-fills are consumed in a 12-month period (6.7 crore vials, 2.5 cartridge and 0.7 disposable pens), adding to the burden of glass and plastic on the environment.“While modern insulin technique guidelines address the need for appropriate disposal of needles and syringes, safe disposal of insulin delivery sharps is seldom practiced in clinic and home care environment,” said Sanjay Kalra, FIT advisory broad member and lead author of the “Green Diabetology” article.Apart from environmental contamination, unsafe disposal also has an adverse impact on healthcare workers. As per the FIT recommendations, biomedical diabetes care-related wastes need to recycled and not reused.In an effort to address safe and environment-friendly insulin disposal, healthcare professionals will initiate a nation-wide movement for green diabetology — Go Green, Stay Fit — which will aim towards safe disposal of insulin syringes and pen needles and prevention of reuse or re-capping of insulin injecting devices to prevent accidental needle-stick injuries.Plastic generated from insulin syringes per year is 6 lakh kg, besides 40 million pen needles
