The political leadership of Jammu and Kashmir — both separatists and mainstream parties — want the India-Pakistan dialogue process, which seemed to be in some doubt after Saturday’s terror attack, to continue.Speaking to The Hindu, the State’s septuagenarian separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said the Pathankot violence should not be linked with the talks. The two countries should continue to engage with each other and resolve Kashmir and other disputes, he said.National Conference leader Ali Muhammad Saga said the strike was an attempt to derail the dialogue process.The Peoples Democratic Party said India should not give up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif’s attempts to resolve the pending disputes.“Pakistan itself is a victim of terror,” said PDP spokesperson Waheed Parra.“We must understand that some non-State actors are hurting us. The whole country is not supporting terrorists.”
