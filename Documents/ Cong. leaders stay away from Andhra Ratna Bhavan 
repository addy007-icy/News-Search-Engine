The Congress flock seems to be dwindling with most of the leaders and cadres staying away from Andhra Ratna Bhavan, the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) headquarters of Andhra Pradesh.City Congress president Malladi Vishnu who is currently embroiled in the spurious liquor case and a few of his close family members (brothers) hoisted the Tri-colour at the Andhra Ratna Bhavan on Tuesday. Barring former DCC chief Naraharisetti Narasimha Rao, none of the other leaders attended the flag hoisting ceremony which is normally well attended by the party workers, if not the leaders. PCC general secretary Akula Srinivas Kumar hoisted the Tricolour flag in One Town and “escaped” coming to Andhra Ratna Bhavan. Several active leaders who are regulars to the Andhra Ratna Bhavan stayed away.
