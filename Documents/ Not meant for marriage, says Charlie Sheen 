Actor Charlie Sheen doesn’t think he is “good” at being a husband.“{My addiction} didn’t help. I don’t know if I’m cut out for marriage to begin with. I have amazing children as a result. I don’t regret that for one second,” Sheen said.“Denise and Brooke, they’re doing the best that they can and they’re both terrific mothers and, we don’t always get along,” he added.The 50-year-old actor was diagnosed HIV + four years ago, and says the news has brought him closer to his father Martin Sheen, reports femalefirst.co.uk.In the second part of his sit-down interview with Dr. Oz, Sheen said, “I don’t want to say it’s specifically changed our relationship, but something happened between us. We are much better friends than we’ve ever been. We don’t judge each other. {It’s} nothing but fun when we hang out. We don’t agree on everything, obviously. I mean which son and father does? He’s special. And I’m really lucky to have him.”
