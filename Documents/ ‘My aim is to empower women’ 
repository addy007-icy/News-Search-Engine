Arunachalam Muruganantham, the inventor of low-cost sanitary pad making machine who has been honoured with the Padma Shri, said he was happy but only cautiously so. “I am happy about the award but I need to be careful and ensure that I continue the work. Wherever I go, I tell them that I am not here to sell machinery but to create a social change by empowering women. I hope to inspire more youngsters to take the technical platform and become social entrepreneurs,” he said. In the last ten years, the social entrepreneur has installed 2,460 machines across the country and 17 other nations.- M. Soundarya Preetha
