India may consider conditional use of the Decision Review System after consultation with the team management on its return from Australia.BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said here on Monday that India was not convinced the system was foolproof but it might be inclined to consider its use if leg-before decisions were left out of the ambit of the DRS.Thakur was speaking to the media at a promotional event of the ICC.He also defended India skipper M.S. Dhoni in the context of the team losing three matches in a row.“Dhoni has been one of the most successful captains, and it is unfair to question his leadership after this loss. India has won two World Cups (ODI and T20) under his captaincy. The defeats are a concern and the team management and the selectors will assess the performances before the Asia Cup and the T20 World Cup,” Thakur said.He also said Ravi Shastri will remain Team Director until the T20 World Cup.“We will pick a chief coach after the T20 World Cup,” said Thakur. The chief coach is to be picked in consultation with the Advisory Committee comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman.The ICC, meanwhile, reaffirmed its commitment to the Spirit of Cricket and bringing about positive social change through the sport, by launching ‘Cricket for Good’, its CSR programme, in association with UNICEF here.
