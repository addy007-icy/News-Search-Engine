The new block for the district hospital here, constructed at a cost of Rs.3.45 crore, was inaugurated by Minister for Health V.S. Sivakumar on Thursday. Mr. Sivakumar said facilities such as MRI scan, cathlab, and chemotherapy would be installed in the block. The Minister said on an average 2,000 out-patients were treated at the Kollam district hospital every day. That by itself made it one of the biggest district hospitals in the State. He said the hospital had a sanctioned strength of 55 doctors. Five vacant posts would be filled soon.
