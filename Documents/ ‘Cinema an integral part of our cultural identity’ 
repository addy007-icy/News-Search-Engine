The K.R. Narayanan National Institute of Visual Science and Arts was inaugurated by Vice-President M. Hamid Ansari at Thekkumthala, 27 km off Kottayam, on Monday.Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ansari said that cinema had become an integral part of the nation’s cultural identity. While it was a form of popular entertainment, it had also emerged as a mass communication medium, which could transmit political and social messages.While it was true that a large number of films were made for entertainment, the meaningful and artistic films continued to hold a special place in the minds of the audience. Visual media was therefore attractive to youngsters today — both as an avenue of creative expression and as a career choice.“The medium of cinema undergoes a fundamental change whenever there is a new discovery in technology. Silent movies became talkies; black and white became colour; celluloid film gave way to digital formats. In this scenario, new aspirants need to learn not only the basics of the art and craft but also how to adapt with and adopt the latest technology,” he said.Governor P. Sathasivam said the institute would fulfil the unbridled enthusiasm of the young to conquer new frontiers.Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the government was working towards declaring the autonomous institution into a deemed university in the near future.
