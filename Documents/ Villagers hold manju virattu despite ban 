Manju Virattu (bull race), a sport that has been banned along with jallikkattu , was held in several villages braving the ban order on Saturday.Adhamangalam Pudur village in Kalasapakkam taluk is famous in this region for conducting manju virattu .About 40 bulls participated in the race held in this village on Saturday in view of Mattu Pongal festival.Mel Chozhankuppam, Keel Palur and Veeralur are among the other villages where manju virattu was held despite the ban.Manju Virattu was held twice earlier in Mel Chozhankuppam village on New Yearâ€™s Day and on the first of Tamil month Margazhi this year and the police had booked cases.No bull taming takes place in manju virattu like in jallikkattu. The bulls would be decorated by their owners, normally farmers, with specially made braze ornaments, balloons, ribbons and their horns would be scrubbed and painted for Mattu Pongal , the second day of three day Pongal festival. Owners of the bulls would take these decorated bulls to a common place in the village for the manju virattu .From there the bulls would be let loose and made to run through a course, normally longest street in the village.The bulls would go in leaps and bounds up to other end of the street. People would converge on two sides of the street to take a look at the bulls and appraise their splendour. In few instances people standing in sideways would try to touch the racing bulls. But there would be nothing that can be called taming would take place.Manju Virattu was held twiceearlier in Mel Chozhankuppam village
