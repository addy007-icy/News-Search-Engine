Borna Coric will be watched with interest at the Chennai Open after his exploits in the year gone by.The 19-year-old zoomed into the top-50 in the rankings with some solid efforts and stunning results.“The year 2015 proved that I could play with the best in the world. It also showed that it wouldn’t be an easy climb any longer,” said Coric, who has set his sights on making it to the top-30 in the leap year.Even if he manages to reach his goal, the Croat knows that the difference in standards between the top-10 and the rest is quite big. Coric, rated highly by Goran Ivanisevic and tipped to become a Grand Slam champion, has worked hard for the journey ahead.“I trained for nearly six hours a day in the pre-season and I am feeling really good. Come Monday, I will be ready,” he said.About his chances here, Coric said: “I am focusing on the first round as Marcel (Granollers) is a tough opponent. I will take it step by step.”Whatever happens, there’s no doubt that the Croat’s every move on court will attract attention.
