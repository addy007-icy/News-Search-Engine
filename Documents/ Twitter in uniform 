If the Supreme Court’s direction that arrests can be made only if the accused are required is strictly complied with, as many as 1,460 undertrial prisoners can be released immediately from the jails of Delhi. This view was presented before a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court during the hearing of a suo motu case last week, when it was pointed out that the trial courts should not authorise detention of the accused in a mechanical manner. The apex court had also directed that undertrial prisoners, who had completed half of the sentence prescribed for their offence, should be released. The counsel’s submission came in response to the court’s query made during the hearing of the issues related to overcrowding in jails and prolonged detention of male and female undertrial prisoners in Delhi. When the court was told that several undertrials were behind bars because the hearings on their bail applications could not be completed due to lack of public prosecutors, the Bench asked the Delhi government to submit a status report on the number of public prosecutors engaged in all trial courts and the infrastructure provided to them.----------------------------Senior Minister has been irked by persistent phone calls from acquaintances complaining about the slightest of inconveniences at government facilities or services, he rued at a closed gathering here last week.The Minister was speaking to the media when the topic of a new helpline promising time-bound maintenance work at government schools was broached. “Where do you think the idea of the helpline came from?” the Minister joked.----------------------------Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi’s decision to take actively to Twitter has compelled many of his officers to gear up. So when Bassi asked a senior officer to deal with a complainant on Twitter, the officer was in a dilemma.It took him some time to retrieve the password of his account he had created years ago.“My display picture in that account was a very informal one. I immediately dressed up in my uniform, asked a family member to take a snap and then uploaded it,” the officer recounted.Though Bassi had said that he would not be addressing complainants via Twitter, except in exceptional cases, he and his officers are actually reaching out to Twitter users.(Contributed byMohammed Iqbal, Jatin Anand and Shiv Sunny)
