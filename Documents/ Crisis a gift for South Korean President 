North Korea’s nuclear test has provoked global outrage, a push for sanctions, even fear. But Kim Jong-un’s decision to conduct it has also handed a gift of sorts to his rival in the South.In an instant, Wednesday’s explosion shifted the focus on the presidency of Park Geun-hye, who has faced several mass protests condemning her leadership in recent weeks.Park’s swift, hard-line response, including a return of cross-border propaganda broadcasts that Pyongyang loathes, has, for the time being, overshadowed criticism over her leadership style, her alleged abuse of workers’ rights and her purported submission to Tokyo in a deal meant to end a dispute over Japan’s wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women.Ms. Park has temporarily stopped a slide in popularity by doing something she has proven herself adept at: standing tall in the face of what Seoul sees as a provocation from its northern rival.A survey showed her approval rating rose slightly last week, for the first time in five weeks though the boost is likely to be temporary. — AP
