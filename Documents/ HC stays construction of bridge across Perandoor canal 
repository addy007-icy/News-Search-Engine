The Kerala High Court stayed the construction of the bridge over Perandoor Canal to link Girinagar 4{+t}{+h}Cross Road to Panampilly Nagar Eldersâ€™ Forum Road.The construction was being carried out by the Greater Cochin Development Authority.A Division Bench of the High Court consisting of Chief Justice Ashok Bhushan and A.M. Shaffique issued the order on a petition filed by P. Kesavan and 15 others.The petitioners had also approached the court seeking to prevent the Authority from diverting the city traffic on to the service roads of Girinagar, Panampilly Nagar and Krishna Vihar residential colonies.The petitioners contended that the new bridge was likely to create traffic blocks and was unlikely to be used by any genuine road user.The entire length of the canal was included in the Detailed Town Planning Scheme for Elamkulam west, and there was only provision for one bridge across the canal. The bridge construction was in violation of the scheme, he argued.
