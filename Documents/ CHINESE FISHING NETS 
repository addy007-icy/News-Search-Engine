The dozen iconic Chinese fishing nets that dot Fort Kochi beach are easily the heritage locale’s best USP.Kerala Tourism’s Rs 1.50 crore initiative to maintain the structures at the aesthetic best by renovating the cantilevered nets using long teak wood logs, has not borne fruit so far. With teak logs prohibitively costly, fishermen manning them began substituting them with iron pipes, at the cost of aesthetics. Tourism officials said that a case filed by fishermen demanding direct handing over of money, stalled the initiative. Negotiations are on with fishermen. Another alternative is Chinese Embassy’s offer of help to restore the nets to their past glory.A project to build a heritage walkway linking heritage locales in Fort Kochi and Mattanchery is a non-starter. The beach walkway is incomplete, while footpaths paved using costly granite blocks are crying for upkeep. Tourists prefer to walk around the locale, than use motorised transport.A few rides have been replaced. The condition of benches for people to sit is deplorable. Water logging during monsoon is a problem.Most of the cast-iron heritage lights installed here are in dilapidated condition and do not have bulbs. The proposal to lit up the entire beach front and ill-lit streets is hanging fire.The sole pay and use toilet in the locale maintained by Fort Kochi Heritage Conservation Society is locked down for the past few weeks. It also needs maintenance. A toilet block proposed in the Fort Kochi master plan is yet to materialise.Garbage and litter abound in the locale, despite discerning tourists hatred for plastic and fish waste. Kerala Tourism, DTPC and Kochi Corporation failed to do justice to visitors.
