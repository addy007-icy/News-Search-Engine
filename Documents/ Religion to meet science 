About 50 scientists from 15 countries will be attending the International Conference on Science and Jain Philosophy to be held at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay from January 8 to 10.Pramod Tiwari, media coordinator for the event, said, “The conference has been organised with an eye on today’s youth who are confused between science and their dharma [religion]. They are in two minds about what to follow. Science is fine, but they feel that sometimes science does not get the results. They feel their education is entirely based on science. There should be an element of religion too. Religion is right in its own place. What our religion has said 500 years ago, science proves the same thing later.”The event, according to an official press release, will see “scientists, spiritualists and philosophers meet on a common platform to identify gaps in viewpoints and search for common goals among those apparently diverse-looking disciplines.The challenge is to seek truth by convergence of spectrum of methods and approaches to diverse disciplines…Considerable emphasis is given to highlight attributes of ahimsa [non-violence], strength of tolerance and preservation of environment.”ISRO Chairman AS Kiran Kumar will deliver the keynote address and Union Minister Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan will be the chief guest at the conference.Vice-Chancellors of over 18 Indian universities are slated to attend along with scientists and philosophers from USA, UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, South Korea and Sri Lanka. Supreme Court Justice Dalveer Bhandari will inaugurate the conference.50 scientiststo attend global conference on science and Jain philosophy
