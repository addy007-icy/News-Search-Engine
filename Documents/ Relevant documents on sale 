Wondering what exactly the whole text of Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya’s letter to his Cabinet colleague Smriti Irani was? Or what exactly the communication from the University of Hyderabad authorities about the incidents preceding the suicide of 26-year-old research scholar Rohith Vemula was? Then shell out Rs. 50 and they are yours!Displaying a list of 20 documents, the Joint Action Committee (JAC) leading the protests against Rohith’s suicide here put up all the relevant documents like the November 24 Vice-Chancellor executive council report, the proctoral board report among others for sale on Wednesday. The students also stuck copies of all the documents that they were providing at the Information Centre at Shopcom, the epicentre of the protests. The move might just put varsity officials in a sticky situation, considering that any student can now read and see what exactly had transpired. And throughout the day, many of those who attended the day-long protests in support of the JAC happily bought the documents, only to sit and go through all of them. “This is to ensure that everyone who comes here has access to all the information about the incident. It is also for the media, so that they can gather the same at one place,” said Tathagath, an assistant professor from UOH, who was present there.“The only reason why we are selling it is because of the cost involved in photo-copying all of them, as there are many of them. People can just download it online otherwise,” said a student who was volunteering with the JAC during the protests. On the board at the Information Centre, a notice clearly stated that the soft copies of all the documents can also be downloaded from the Facebook page ‘Joint Action Committee For Social Justice-UOH’.
