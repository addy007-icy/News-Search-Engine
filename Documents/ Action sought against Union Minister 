Some organisations staged protests here on Friday against what they called the “excessive politicisation” of institutions of higher education by the Union government that was leading to suicides of students from the downtrodden sections like Rohith Vemula.The protesters walked from Ambedkar Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office, shouting slogans against the Union government and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani. They submitted a memorandum to the President of India through the authorities demanding action against university officials and Union Minister of Labour Bandaru Dattatreya for creating conditions that pushed the research scholar to suicide. They said that the Union government was using Sangh Parivar outfits to unleash atrocities on Dalit students in universities and institutions of higher education. Activists of the Communist party of India and the Dalit Sangharsh Samiti were present.
