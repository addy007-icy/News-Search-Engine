I reside in a 17-year-old apartment complex in Ashok Nagar, that has six units.We have been doing periodical, small repairs and recently, two new buyers have been doing repairs without the consent of the other residents.They now want to do structural alterations in the flat and peripherals for a sum ofRs. 5 lakh.The remaining residents do not want to go ahead with these changes.How do we go about this? Is there any legal solution?ChennaiAt the outset, since there are six apartments, you must have a registered association and bye-laws.All the aspects of common area maintenance have to be decided in the General Body, subject to the provisions of the prevailing bye-laws.
