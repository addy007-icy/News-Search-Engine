The U.K. police have recruited a four-month-old puppy and named it after the heroic dog ‘diesel’ which was killed in a French police raid following the Paris attacks.A Belgian Malinois has joined North Yorkshire Police and begun the process that could see it qualify as a fully-fledged police dog.“The name Diesel was chosen out of respect for the police dog that died in a raid on an apartment block in Saint-Denis, Paris, in November,” Sergeant Simon Whitby, of the North Yorkshire Police Dog Section was quoted as saying by the Daily Express.Death touched us all“The death touched us all, and having the name live on is a wonderful way to respect Diesel’s memory.”Sgt. Whitby said Diesel has been assigned to a volunteer puppy walker to ensure it gains experience of a variety of situations, including socialising with people, other animals, busy traffic, crowds of people and loud noises.Diesel, a seven-year-old Belgian Malinois French police dog, was killed during a major counter-terror raid on an apartment block in Saint-Denis on November 18.It was shot while armed police raided an apartment where Paris attacks mastermind Abdehamid Abaaoud and six other terror suspects were staying.
