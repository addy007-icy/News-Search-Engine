Four days ahead of the much awaited formal test run, work on shifting the first lot of three metro coaches from the inspection bay to the test track at Muttom yard near Kalamassery is in top gear.Officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and French firm Alstom are busy wrapping up routine testing of various components of the coaches at the inspection bay.“The coaches will be shifted to the test track either on Monday or Tuesday. The works to be completed before shifting the coaches from the inspection bay are progressing as planned. Things are in order,” said a senior DMRC official on Sunday.The metro coaches will be operated initially at a speed of five km per hour along the 975-metre test track. It will be increased gradually. The formal trial run will commence on January 23 along the metro viaduct where rails have been laid.The sides of the coaches will be wrapped in Kerala-specific themes such as Chinese fishing nets, the wildlife of the Western Ghats, kettuvallom and Kathakali by Tata Elxsi, the customer experience consultant, before the train is formally unveiled by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on January 23. Each coach has four external sliding doors on each side to enable fast embarking and disembarking of passengers at stations.The coaches will undergo further tests on the track until February-end, following which they will chug out from the depot for trial runs in the Muttom-Edappally metro viaduct.
