Can anyone imagine owning a television with the thickness and weight of a sheet of paper? This is very much possible, according to Prof. K.V.Ramanujachary from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Rowan University, New Jersy, US.He was addressing an international seminar on ‘Luminescence and Materials’ organised by the department of physics, D.S. Government Degree College for Women, here on Thursday.Describing the science of light as the most studied yet the least understood subject, he said the challenge before scientists and technologists was to develop materials that gave light at a cheaper cost without polluting the environment.Referring to the rapid depletion of non-renewable fossil resources, Prof. Ramanujachary, who delivered the keynote address, underscored the need for exploring inorganic materials for production of value-added chemicals and fuels.
