The Coimbatore Corporation on Wednesday began screening visitors to its zoo near VOC Park following orders from Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan.According to sources, the move follows a visit by Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan to the zoo on Tuesday following suggestions from animal lovers and non-government organisation, Animal Rescuers, that the civic body take steps to improve the zoo.One of the suggestions was to screen visitors for plastic bags or snacks.Vinny R. Peter of Animal Rescuers says that the visitors, who carried the snacks, fed the animals, which was wrong.This has changed the behaviour of a few animals. To put an end of the practice and also reduce plastics in the zoo, they had suggested and the Corporation had accepted the same.The zoo sees 500 visitors on weekdays and nearly 1,500 on weekends.The Rescuers has also suggested shifting a few animals so that the prey and predator are not placed next to one another, cleaning a few enclosures to allow more sunlight and feeding frugivorous birds with only fruits.The sources say the civic body will further improve the amenities in the zoo even as it takes steps to obtain licence from the Central Zoo Authority.The civic body has been writing to the Authority, but the latter has asked the Corporation to first shift the zoo to a new location to house the animals, birds and reptiles in more spacious enclosures.The Corporation has been trying to identify land for a new zoo but is unsuccessful. The search for the land continues, the sources add.
