An apex body of industrialists on Thursday put its weight behind the Delhi government’s odd-even car policy that will be implemented from Friday, asking all its members to support the initiative.The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) has written to all of its 1.28 lakh members and associates in the National Capital Region to join the government’s attempt to cut pollution. The ASSOCHAM suggested that businesses should facilitate staff to carpool. “Under no circumstances should we let this programme suffer,” wrote ASSOCHAM president Sunil Kanoria. Mr. Kanoria added that women, who are exempted from the government’s plans, should also be involved in the programme. Companies could tweak working hours and give staff some flexibility so they can participate in the odd-even traffic plan, he said.
