Children were asked to cultivate the habit of using toilets, both at home and in schools.Artists said that open defecation would not only harm individuals, but also the entire society, particularly the children who are the future citizens of the country.Organisers said that the programmes were carried out in villages in the block for the past five months during evening hours.They said that the response from the villagers was encouraging as many have come forward to construct toilets at their home.
