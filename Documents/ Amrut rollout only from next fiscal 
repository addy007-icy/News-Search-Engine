: The real-time implementation of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) in Kozhikode city will begin only by next fiscal though Chief Minister Oommen Chandy officially inaugurated the initiative of Union Ministry of Urban Development last week.A reason cited for this is that the funds would lapse if any expenditure is shown and no projects are executed this fiscal.So it is better to stick with the provision of carrying out the projects from April, officials say.Nine citiesKannur and Guruvayur municipalities, also included in the Amrut Mission in the State, will also emulate the Kozhikode model showing zero expenditure this fiscal. Nine cities have been identified from Kerala for funding under Amrut and a sum of Rs.57.6 crore had been released for the financial year.Preparing DPROfficials say that the last quarter of this financial year will be solely utilised for preparing the detailed project report (DPR), getting approval from the technical committee, preparing the tender documents and inviting tenders.In fact, the Centre has sanctioned Rs.71.3 crore for Kozhikode city for projects in five components such as water supply ( Rs.17.87 crore); sewage and septage management (Rs.45.60 crore) drainage (Rs.6.81 crore) and green spaces (Rs.85 lakh) this financial year.
