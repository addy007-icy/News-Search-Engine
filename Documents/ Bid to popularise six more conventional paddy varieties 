After popularising 18 conventional varieties of paddy, National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) has taken up initiative for popularising six more new varieties this year in the district.The new varieties being raised during the current season are ‘Milagu samba’, ‘Karuppu kavani’, ‘Kuzhi adhichan’, ‘Kattu ponni’, ‘Yanai komban’ and ‘Salem senna’.The corresponding duration of these crops would be 115 days, 135, 120, 120, 130 and 140 days.A total of 137 acres had been covered in a cluster of villages, said S. Somasundaram, Assistant General Manager, NABARD.The programme, being implemented through Rose Trust, a service organisation, aims to revive the conventional paddy varieties.Explaining the advantages of these varieties, A. Adhappan, managing director of the trust, said assured marketability with prospective price attracted farmers.IrrigationAll these crops needed less irrigation facility in contrast to the ‘samba’ or ‘kuruvai’ varieties of paddy. The yield per acre would range between 20 and 35 bags each of 60 kg.The new crops are being raised in a cluster of villages including Munasandhai, Nallipatti, Mela Pazhuvanji, Melur, Muthukadu and Vanagapatti, said Mr. Somasundaram.The crops would be harvested in a few months.
