The conviction of 21 of the 22 accused in what is known as the Narath arms training case by the Special NIA Court in Kochi on Wednesday is seen as a commendation of the police team which busted the weapons training camp run by a radical Islamist group at Narath here on April 23, 2013.The verdict has been greeted by the police officers involved in the action before it was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The training camp run allegedly by the Popular Front of India (PFI) was unravelled following a police raid led by the then Kannur Deputy Superintendent of Police P. Sukumaran. All the 21 youths arrested during the raid were workers of the PFI or the Social Democratic Party of India, the political arm of the PFI.“The verdict gives me immense happiness as it has proved that the police action and the initial investigation were very effective,” Mr. Sukumaran said. The police raid followed a tip-off, he said.The police personnel involved in the raid recalled that when the team reached the spot, two youths standing guard outside the building ran away. That raised their suspicion. The police found a person delivering an incendiary speech and giving weapons training to a group of youths. Most youths were from Edakkad and Muzhappilangad, nearly 25 km from Narath.The raid and arrest then turned the spotlight on the alleged activities of the radical group in the area. The police on December 6, 2005 seized 20 powerful pipe bombs and explosive materials from an area close to the camp. On November 16, 2012, six crude bombs had been seized from an uninhabited house at Onaparamba, near Narath.
