When Massimiliano Latorre, one of the two Italian marines accused of murdering two fishermen off the Kerala coast in 2012, was allowed by the Supreme Court to go back home because of ill-health, I knew he would not return to India to face a judicial probe (“Italian marine Latorre will not return to India,” Jan. 13). My fears have come true. Latorre deserves the second prize for the ease with which he has cocked a snook at the Indian authorities. The first prize was bagged long back by Warren Anderson.P.G.
