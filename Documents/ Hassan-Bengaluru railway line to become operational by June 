The Hassan-Bengaluru railway line will become operational by June this year, A. Manju, Minister in-charge of Hassan district, said here on Monday. “As per the earlier plan, the project should have been completed by March this year. However, I am told that it will take two more months,” the Minister told presspersons.The railway connectivity between Hassan and Bengaluru has become a necessity as Shravanabelagola is getting ready for the Mahamastakabhisheka in 2018, a major event that is held once in 12 years. “Railway connectivity helps visitors go to Shravanabelagola during the programme from across the country and abroad. For many years, the people of Hassan have been waiting for this railway line,” he said.Mr. Manju said that the State government had sanctioned Rs. 25 crore for upgrading the Hassan-Duda-Tiptur road. “This road has been in a bad state for several years. Last year, temporary repair work was carried out to make it motorable. Now, the government has allocated funds for upgrading it,” he said. Residents of Hassan and neighbouring villages had staged many protests in the past to get the road improved.Further, the Minister said that the district administration would procure certified seed potatoes this year and distribute them among the growers.“All these years, table potatoes meant for cooking were being provided as seed potatoes. Farmers were suffering a huge loss owing to this practice. From now on, we are making efforts to provide certified seed potatoes,” he said.The project was originally scheduled for completion by March-end: MinisterState government said to have released Rs. 25 crore for upgrading Hassan-Duda-Tiptur road
