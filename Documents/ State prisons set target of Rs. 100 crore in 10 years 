Earning Rs.100 crore in 10 years!Well, this is not the target of a private company, but the one set by the Telangana State Prisons and Correctional Services Department.Prison officials of the less than two-years-old State say they have generated Rs. 4.77 crore profit out of the Rs. 216.03 crore turnover recorded in the calendar year of 2015. This turnover was the result of selling goods produced by the inmates of different prisons in Telangana.A considerable income was generated through the fuel station where petrol and diesel are sold to general public such as any other filling station, located adjacent to the Chanchalguda Central Prison. Prisoners, who had shown good conduct, are engaged to work in this filling station.“We aimed at generating Rs.5 crore income this year and almost succeeded in achieving the target, but for a few lakhs,” said a beaming V.K. Singh, Director General of Telangana Prisons and Correctional Services.Detailing the innovations made by the department at a press conference, Mr. Singh said 80 new vehicles - 21 four-wheelers and 59 two-wheelers, were purchased by the department with the income earned.Buoyed by the ‘income generation and profit’, the authorities set eyes to double the profit in year 2016 and hope to make Rs. 100 crore profit by 2025. National Crime Record Bureau statistics suggest that Tamil Nadu with over Rs. 30 crore turnover was the State to register highest turnover from Jails Department, but Telangana State can claim credit for having achieved highest turnover now, the DG maintained.Eighty-three prisoners approached the officials seeking employment.
