: The continuing drive by the Fisheries Department against trash fish hunt has provoked a section of fishermen’s collective in the Kozhikode coastal area to voice their strong differences of opinion with regard to the implementation of the Kerala Marine Fishing Regulation Act.Leaders of the fishermen’s collective argue that the Minimum Legal Size (MLS) norms fixed by the Fisheries Department as per the Fishing Regulation Act are highly impractical to follow as fishermen would not be able to measure the size of the seized varieties on the spot and sort it out just to comply with the rules. “First of all, the enforcement squads should teach us properly on how to avoid juvenile fishes and then try to enforce the rules,” they said.“Our collective decision is to resist all kinds of seizure measures on the part of the Marine Enforcement wing on the issue. The Fisheries Department will have to find out a proper remedy for this other than impounding the boats and imposing fine against the boat owners,” says Karichal Preman, president of Beypore Harbour Development Committee. He also claims that no fishermen from the area are deliberately hunting trash fish varieties other than the edible items for sale.Meanwhile, officials of the Fisheries Department say Beypore is one of the two hotspots of trash fish hunting and strict action would be taken on noticing the practice complying with the standing instructions of the government. According to them, the MLS is fixed mainly to protect the deliberate hunting of juvenile fishes for various fertiliser companies.“We are not hostile to the legal fishing activities off the coast, but, there will not be any relaxation on the existing rules, especially the MLS, as fixed by the government,” says Fisheries Deputy Director Mariyam Haseena. She adds that the action taken against fishermen in the last five-month term is based on clear evidence.At present, the Fisheries Department has the support of a 11-member enforcement squad led by a Circle Inspector to intercept the violators and impound the stock and boat for further legal actions. So far, around 10 boats have been impounded by the squad from the Kozhikode coastal area as part of the continuing legal action.Fishermen claim MLS is not practicalPlan to resist Marine Enforcement wing’s actionFisheries Department officials say MLS should be followed strictly
