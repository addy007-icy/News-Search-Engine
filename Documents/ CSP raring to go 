The Coastal Security Police (CSP) are also geared up for the event. The recent CII Partnership Summit was like a rehearsal for the IFR, said IG Coastal Security Police (CSP) Suryaprakash Rao.“At present, there are about three boats of the CSP in the district.

The boats will function 24X7 in three shifts,” said Mr. Suryaprakash Rao.The extent covered will be about 87 nautical miles and the patrolling party will cover about 36 fishing villages and 35 landing points along the coast.“All fishermen have been given bar-coded ID cards and each outgoing and incoming fisherman will be counted and the ID card checked with the help of hand-held card readers,” said DSP Narasimha Rao.
