A 450-year old tradition, protected and religiously followed by residents of about 250 villages in the Amalapuram revenue division, for some strange reason, has failed to grab the attention of the government.The Prabhala Theertham, or Prabhala panduga in local parlance, is all about taking out Prabhalu (flowery replica of religious idols built with bamboo frames decorated with colour papers and lights)in a procession that adds beauty to the Konaseema region during Sankranti festival. These decorated bamboo arches with Lord Siva’s images on them, are taken around in a huge procession from 150 villages in Konaseema area. The practice is said to be in vogue from the time of Pithapuram Rajahs. A few archives in Rajamahendravaram Gowthami Regional library indicate that the Pithapuram king’s advisor Vittal Jakkanna started the tradition of Prabhalu to bring unity among all sections of people.These decorated pieces emerge from different Agraharams, villages and colonies and merge at places like Jaganna Thota, once called Vittal Jakkanna thota, Gangalakurru, Mosallapalli, Vakkalanka, K. Pedapudi, Irusumanda, Nedunuru, Mukkamala, Palagummi, Kulletikurru, Gangalakurru Agraharam and Vyaghreswaram.On Kanuma day every year, many NRIs join their local friends to watch the traditional procession.The height of a prabha is the main attraction. The revellers burst crackers throughout the way. This year’s tallest prabha in Kondaseema was a 50-ft high Tondavaram Todeswaraswami Prabham next only to a 45-ft high prabha brought from Vakalagruvu village.
