Pledging her support to the growth of sports in the region, Madhya Pradesh Sports Minister Yashodhara Scindia on Wednesday sounded a warning to the State coaches that favouritism in selection of players will not be tolerated.The Minister recalled that as a jockey she had witnessed players falling prey to nepotism and favouritism.“I had been a national level jockey. I had seen my colleagues paying a price due to favouritism and nepotism, so after becoming Sports Minister I have vowed to ensure that no injustice was done to the players,” Ms Scindia said during the foundation stone laying function of Kailassa Basketball arena at Basketball complex here.“We continued playing despite government’s inadequate funds. We experienced the difficulties in arranging diet for us and fodder for our horses. When we used to approach the Sports Ministers, we found their doors shut for us.“I had made it amply clear to coaches that neither nepotism and nor unfair recommendations in selecting players will be tolerated,” Ms Scindia added.“Players are also welcome at my doorstep. They don’t have to seek an appointment to meet me,” the Minister said.She said the State government’s different sports academies were trying to groom international players and she had assured Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to produce an Olympian from the State this year. -- PTI
