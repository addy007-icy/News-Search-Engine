Farmers in the command area of Tunga reservoir staged a protest under the aegis of Tunga Naala Horata Samiti here on Saturday, demanding completion of the modernisation of Tunga canals in an expedited manner.The protesters welcomed the decision taken by the State government recently to modernise the canals of Tunga reservoir at the cost of Rs. 239 crore. The protesters said that the farmers in the tail-end region of the command area would get ample water after the completion of the modernisation work.In the first phase, it has been planned to complete the work on the left bank canal up to a distance of 34 km and right bank canal up to a distance of 26 km at the cost of Rs. 127 crore.The protesters said that as the flow of water along the canal has to be stopped for modernisation work, the standing crops in the command area would face problems.According to terms of the contract, the first phase of work should be completed by the end of May this year. The protesters urged the government to take up the work immediately and complete it within the deadline.
