The Congress on Sunday said it will challenge in court Cabinet’s recommendation for imposing President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh if it gets presidential assent, as the party lashed out at the Narendra Modi government accusing it of “trampling” on democracy.The “very wrong” step has exposed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “doublespeak” on federalism, the party alleged.“Modi government’s decision to impose >President’s rule in Arunachal Pradesh reflects travesty of Constitutional mandate, subjugation of federalism and trampling of democracy,” AICC communication department chief Randeep Surjewala said.“Modiji’s doublespeak of respect for federalism and States being equal part of ‘Team India’ stands exposed,” Mr. Surjewala said.Congress leader Kapil Sibal said the party will move court and alleged that the step shows that Mr. Modi is “fountainhead” of political intolerance.“We will challenge it.... This bypassing the matter, which is being heard by the >Supreme Court.... President is Constitutional head he will apply his mind and will take appropriate decision,” Mr. Sibal told reporters.“Government has taken a very wrong step. There cannot be possibly any wrong step than this. The >Governor had embarrassed himself and now the government is embarrassing itself. They will pay a heavy price,” he remarked.“They have taken the step despite knowing well the decision on President’s rule cannot get approval of Parliament as they do not have majority in the Rajya Sabha,” Mr. Sibal said.“This is an act of political intolerance by government, which talks of cooperative federalism,” he said.
