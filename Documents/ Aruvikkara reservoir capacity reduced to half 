The storage capacity of Aruvikkara reservoir, the sole source of drinking water to the city, has reduced by 50 per cent.A recent study by Kerala State Mineral Development Corporation Limited (KEMDEL) says this has necessitated urgent measures to increase the water-holding capacity so as to augment drinking water supply and also as a step towards avoid flooding in low-lying areas of the city.The KEMDEL study, held in August on the directive of the State government, found that the total sediment accumulation in the reservoir is 10,02,944m3, which is 50.14 per cent of the reservoir capacity, resulting in the shrinking of the reservoir capacity to 49.86 per cent.Original capacity 2 million cubic metresThe original capacity of the reservoir was 2 million cubic metres.The agency, which relied on satellite imagery and field visits to gather sedimentation rate in the reservoir, in its report submitted to Kerala Water Authority last month recommends appropriate dredging methods to excavate 9,41,128 tonnes of sand. It has worked out the estimated cost for dredging to be around Rs.50 crore.Analysis of sediment sample found the average percent of sand to be 47 per cent and silt and clay to be 25 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. The total cost of excavated sand will be around Rs.75 crore. “Apart from sand, the silt and clay in the dredged sediment can be used by construction, tile and brick industries, besides for land filling, reclamation and embankments. Additional revenue of around Rs.26 crore can be generated. Thus the total returns from the project will be to the tune of Rs.101.79 crore, which indicates economic viability of the de-siltation project,” the report says.The excavation of sand and other materials will help improve quality of water. Further, increasing the storage capacity will help augment water supply to the existing consumers and extent piped water supply to sub-urban and newly developed areas.
