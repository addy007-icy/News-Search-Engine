The State goes into yet another Pulse Polio immunisation drive on Sunday, and one considered extremely crucial, for this is the last round of the drive using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), before the nation makes the crucial policy shift from trivalent to bivalent OPV later in the year.For Kerala and other southern States, this is also the year when inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) injection will be introduced into the routine immunisation schedule. The Union Health Ministry has already introduced the IPV in seven States and in Kerala, IPV is expected to be introduced in March. “The last and the 7th round of routine immunisation (RI) activities under Indra Dhanush to cover the RI dropouts are currently on in the State as strengthening the RI cover is a very important step before the IPV can be introduced. Fully immunised children in the State constitute 83 per cent,” senior health officials said.According to the global strategy to eliminate polio, all nations have to introduce one round of IPV into the RI schedule, followed by a globally synchronised replacement of trivalent OPV (effective against polio types 1, 2, 3) with bivalent OPV (effective against type 1 , 3) in 2016The last case of polio due to wild virus was reported in Kerala in 2000, while the whole of India has been polio-free for the past five years. This was achieved through years of consistent immunisation using trivalent OPV. The OPV uses a live but weak strain of polio virus to provide immunity. One risk of using OPV has been that the live viruses can undergo genetic changes in the intestine and become virulent. In communities with low RI, these mutated viruses or vaccine-derived polio viruses (VDPVs) can cause paralytic polio in unimmunised children.In 2011, seven such polio cases caused by mutated OPV viruses were reported in India. It is to eliminate this risk of trivalent OPV resulting in polio caused by mutated type 2 virus that the trivalent OPV is being replaced by bivalent OPV which contains only type 1 and 3 viruses.
