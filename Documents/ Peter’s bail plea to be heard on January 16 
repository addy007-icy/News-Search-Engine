The special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Tuesday adjourned media baron Peter Mukerjea’s bail application to January 16.Mr Mukerjea has been lodged at the Arthur Road Jail since December 2 in connection with Sheena Bora murder case. He had moved a bail application on January 4.The application was filed by his advocate Kushal Mor at the sessions court that stated that the CBI has found no evidence to justify his arrest, though it had his custody for 11 days and even subjected him to psycho-analysis and polygraph tests.The CBI itself later applied for his transfer to judicial custody (where he is now), which shows that it completed the investigation and would not require further custody.The grounds for arrest given by the CBI are inconsistent and ambivalent and the entire approach of the agency appears “confused”, the application says. It alleges that the agency was trying to concoct a motive for Peter so as to implicate him. Public prosecutor Kavita Patil, appearing for CBI, sought some time to file a reply.The agency is in the process of collecting evidence and will file an additional charge sheet against Peter on completion of investigation. The CBI is yet to receive reports of the polygraph test on Peter, conducted over the last weekend in Delhi, and also information from Interpol on his bank account abroad.
