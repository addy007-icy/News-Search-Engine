The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) will implead in the case when the State government files a fresh affidavit as directed by the Supreme Court in the matter challenging denial of entry for women in the age group of 10 to 50 years to the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala.Talking to The Hindu , TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan said the abrupt or rather confusing affidavit filed by the previous Left Democratic Front Government might have naturally confused the judiciary.Affidavit“The affidavit filed by a government comprising MLAs who even preferred to take their oath of office not in the name of God have failed to properly apprise the court about the custom and practice at Sabarimala where devotees, cutting across religious barriers, congregate on their annual pilgrimage,” he said.Mr. Gopalakrishnan said “the opinion made by the non-believers on matters relating to faith has little relevance.”“The presiding deity at the Sabarimala temple is considered to be a persistent bachelor ( Naishtika Brahmachari ) and hence the tantric tradition has prohibited the entry of women who have attained puberty to this forest shrine. Moreover, this is a matter of faith for scores of Ayyappa devotees across the globe, he added.Mr. Gopalakrishnan said the TDB would place its strong stand on the matter before the Supreme Court as it is bound to sustain the age-old tradition, custom and practice followed by Ayyappa devotees. He said pilgrims from as many as 30 countries visit Sabarimala and the board was duty-bound to protect their faith.‘A matter of faith’Meanwhile, Sabarimala Tantri Kandararu Mahesh Mohanararu opined that it was a matter of faith, custom and tradition that prevailed in Sabarimala.
