In a boost for the Congress ahead of Assembly by-poll in Maihar constituency, BSP leader Manish Patel on Saturday joined the party.“Congress party welcomes Mr Patel into its family and with his induction the party may strengthen itself in Maihar where by-poll is likely to be held soon,” Madhya Pradesh Congress President Arun Yadav told reporters.Mr Patel had contested the last Assembly elections in 2013 on BSP ticket unsuccessfully in Maihar and secured more than 40,000 votes to register his presence in the constituency.Reportedly, BJP was also eyeing Mr Patel but before it could do so, the Congress sprang a surprise on it by announcing his “induction” into its fold.When asked whether BJP has approached him, Mr Patel said, “I have got some offers in the past but my close relatives were in Congress and in 2013 also I sought ticket from it, but when it was denied, I got an opportunity to contest the polls from BSP.”Mr Patel also thanked BSP for giving him an opportunity as it gave him a chance to prove his credentials, which also paved his way into Congress.He denied that he joined Congress on the promise of getting party ticket for contesting by-poll from Maihar and added, “Now I will remain in Congress for the lifetime and whatever work the party leadership will assign me, I will do that wholeheartedly.”Mr Yadav clarified that the decision to give ticket to Mr Patel or anyone will be taken by the Congress high command at an appropriate time. “There is no pre-condition as such,” he insisted.Winning Maihar by-poll is a must for the BJP to arrest the series of defeats the ruling party had suffered recently in Jhabua Lok Sabha by-poll and also in number of local body elections.For Congress also winning Maihar is imperative as its sitting MLA, Narayan Tripathi resigned from the party and joined BJP during Lok Sabha elections in 2014.BJP is likely to field Mr Tripathi from Maihar.
