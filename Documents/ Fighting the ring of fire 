Fire calls seeking support to keep the blaze under control dominated the activities of the Fire and Rescue wing last year. After fire, then came the emergency and accident rescue operations.The Club Road unit of the Fire and Rescue Department located close to Durbar Hall ground was one of the fire control units which handled the maximum number of fire calls in the city last year.The unit handled 287 such calls followed by Tripunithura station. This unit received 258 calls seeking support to control fire. After the fire fighting exercise, the personnel of the unit handled 137 cases of emergencies including accidents.Of the 505 calls attended by the Gandhi Nagar Fire Station last year, 223 calls pertained to fire outbreaks of varied size and proportion. The personnel attached to the station located in the heart of the city attended 249 calls related to accidents. They also extended their support to the fire fighting operations as they received 32 such calls.In Thrikkakara station, which is located in the industrial sector of the city, calls related to accidents and other emergencies dominated the work chart as they attended 166 such calls. When compared to the accident and emergency related calls, fire calls were less in number.There were 158 fire calls and 14 calls from the neighbourhood units seeking support for fighting emergency situations.As the men and machines of the fire fighting units rush to the accident spots after receiving the SOS calls, each trip incurs considerable expense to the exchequer.The services offered by the fire fighters come absolutely free. Even while attending the fire outbreaks like the incidents of vacant plots catching fire, no fee is charged for pressing its men and machine to action. In most of the cases, it would even be difficult to identify the owners of the abandoned plots in the city, said a fire fighter.
