Minister in-charge of Dharwad district Vinay Kulkani has said that he will shortly convene a meeting of merchants and officials to discuss developing the main market here.Speaking to presspersons after visiting the market area here on Tuesday, Mr. Kulkarni said that the market had turned into a congested area and lacked amenities such as roads, sanitation and parking space. Both vendors and customers were facing trouble there. Hence, it is being contemplated that the market be demolished and a new one constructed. The plan will be finalised after the meeting, he added.Mr. Kulkarni said that the development of the market was being postponed since the last several years due to several reasons. Last year too, works did not commence due to technical reasons. The blue print of the proposed new market complex would be prepared in one month and the new market complex would come up within one year, Mr. Kulkarni said.He also assured that the interests of petty vendors will be safeguarded. They will be provided facilities to carry out their business.The Minister interacted with the vendors and the public and received first-hand information about the prevailing conditions in the market area. The public said that there were 721 shops, though the number of licence holders was only 164.
