Japanese stocks have posted their worst New Year losing streak since 1995 with the benchmark Nikkei falling below levels many market players expected to be a bottom for the year.The Nikkei share average slid to a three-month low of 17,767.34 on Thursday, dragged down by a slew of bearish factors — slumping Chinese stocks and a weakening yuan, North Korea’s nuclear test and tensions in the Middle East.A rush into the safe-haven yen also added to the Nikkei’s woes, pushing the index down 6.7 per cent over four days.Before the New Year began, many market players thought the Nikkei was unlikely to fall below 18,000 points with one survey in the Japanese financial paper, Nikkei Veritas, showing 40 out of 66 respondents not expecting a drop below that level.In a Reuters poll conducted in December, median forecasts for the Nikkei was to rise to 20,900 by June and 21,500 by December.The market’s outlook was bolstered by improved corporate profits, higher dividend payouts and the Bank of Japan’s plan to buy three trillion yen ($25.4 billion) worth of shares per year as part of its ongoing stimulus measures.Many investors, however, expect the poor start to 2016 to be temporary.
