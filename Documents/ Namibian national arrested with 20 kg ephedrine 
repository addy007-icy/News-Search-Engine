In the largest haul of ephedrine in Bengaluru so far, a Namibian national carrying 20 kg of contraband was apprehended by sleuths of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) at the Kempegowda International Airport early on Tuesday.Investigators suspect that the drug, worth over Rs. 60 lakh, was scheduled to be received by dealers here.Ephedrine, a stimulant and banned substance — which is primarily used in rave parties — has been seized on earlier occasions by the city police in small quantities.This is the first haul of the substance by the NCB.Sources in the NCB’s Zonal Unit in Bengaluru said, “Our team on standby intercepted a 50-year-old Namibian man, who disembarked from a flight that arrived in Bengaluru from New Delhi. His hand luggage had 20 kg of ephedrine concealed in packets layered with carbon papers, possibly to avoid detection on an X-ray machine,” said an officer.
