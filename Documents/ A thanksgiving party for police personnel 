“People usually come to us when they have a problem, but today, we were overwhelmed with surprise as more than 200 people walked into the station,” said M. Anbhazhagan, a police officer attached to Kotturpuram police station in Chennai.Residents of Kotturpuram, Besant Nagar and nearby places, volunteers from AID India and over 40 students and teachers from Corporation schools in the locality thronged the station on Saturday evening to thank the police on their selfless efforts towards relief and rescue during the recent floods.“Volunteers were greatly appreciated for the relief work, but not many came forward to thank the police. Over the past few weeks, we had been receiving requests from the residents to help them organise a surprise event to show their appreciation for the police,” says P. Sakthivel, founder of 6.in, surprise party planners.“We held a music event for about an hour at the station, cut and distributed a cake that was sponsored by Cake Square and presented a shield of honour to Kotturpuram police. The students presented poetry and also gifted an artwork to them,” he added.
