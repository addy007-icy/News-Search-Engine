They suspected that Roopa, who is still recovering in the hospital, and her husband Murthy may have dumped the baby in the toilet.When the police detained Murthy for questioning, he clarified that the stillborn his wife gave birth to was buried the same day in his native Krishnapura village in Nanjangud taluk.However, the police continued to have suspicions, after which his relatives exhumed the stillborn and brought it to the police station late on Tuesday.Though the police let off Murthy, the latter and his relatives staged a demonstration in front of Devaraja police station, adjacent to Cheluvamba Hospital, on Wednesday, accusing the hospital management of harassing them.Meanwhile, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Devaraja Sub Division) Girijesh said an investigation into the recovery of the body was continuing. “We don’t know whether the baby was stillborn or if it had died after birth,” he told The Hindu.The recovered body has been sent to Mysore Medical College & Research Institute (MMC&RI) for post-mortem, he said.Meanwhile, Dr. Krishnamurthy, Dean of MMC&RI, said the hospital authorities brought the matter to the notice of the police as a “procedural formality”.He said the hospital authorities is scanning CCTV footage of the past 48 hours of people visiting the hospital to help identify the culprits.
