If getting behind the wheel of a go-kart can generate the rush of adrenaline for racing enthusiasts, the idea of designing and fabricating the racing machine is as invigorating for engineering students.The campus of Shri Vishnu Engineering College for Women, Bhimavaram, will host a rare spectacle of both—students designing and fabricating the moving machine and manoeuvring it racing the wind.A four-day national-level Vishnu Karting Championship, organised by the college’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, will unfold on Friday.In a first-of-its-kind, the event will see participation of 19 teams, each comprising 25 members, from across the country.“Of them, two are all-women teams. The first three days, the vehicles designed and put together by the participants will be put through a volley of tests and on the last day (Sunday), we’ll have a final endurance race followed by a re-inspection of the karts,” said G. Srinivasa Rao, principal of the college.The sport combines the thrill of fast vehicles with sharp turns and collisions. The participants have to create a fail-safe working model of a go-kart that must pass many tests to get the final nod.The judges will evaluate the capabilities of the vehicle and the knowledge of the team members.“The event will help students not only develop technical knowledge, but also build on their managerial skills,” said Mr. Rao. Cash prizes worth Rs. 2.2 lakh is up for grabs.The inauguration of the event will be followed by a technical inspection of the vehicle to ensure safety and security aspects, design and manufacturing and innovation aspects.On the second day, the vehicles will be put to rain test to check if the electronic circuits installed are water-proof.The skid pad and autocross will then come under scanner to evaluate the vehicle’s manoeuvrability, handling and cornering technique.In the afternoon session, students will be asked to put forth their business plan, marketing and sale presentation.Acceleration and Braking besides design and manufacturing will be inspected on the third day while on the final day (Monday), an endurance race will be held to assess the performance of the vehicle on road followed by a re-inspection of the vehicle.National-level Vishnu Karting Championship with 19 teams to kick off at Bhimavaram today
