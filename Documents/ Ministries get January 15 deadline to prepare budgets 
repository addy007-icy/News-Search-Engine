All the ministries will have to prepare their budgets and demands for supplementary grants by January 15 with diligence to avoid excess expenditure, according to a Finance Ministry statement.Under no circumstances must the expenditure ceilings in the Revised Estimates be broken, according to the statement. “The Committee (Public Accounts Committee)… reiterated the need for scrupulous scrutiny), of the budget proposal both at the time of preparation of Demands for Grants. and Supplementary Demands for Grants, rigorous monitoring of the pace of expenditure and strict compliance of General Financial Rules to eliminate the possibility of excess expenditure, under spending, wrongful appropriation, etc.”The Finance Ministry had, just before the recent Winter session, told the other ministries to limit their demands for grants to only a few areas. The ministries were told to stick to the January 15 deadline for the third set of supplementary demands for grants to be raised in the Budget session of Parliament. After that no demands would be entertained.The second supplementary demand, placed before Parliament in the Winter session, was for Rs 56,256.32 crore, out of which allocations were made to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and Defence pensions.“Also, instructions relating to 33 per cent and 15 per cent expenditure ceilings in the last quarter and last month respectively of the flnancial year may be scrupulously followed,” according to the statement.
