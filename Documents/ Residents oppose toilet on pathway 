A group of residents of Bikshandarkovil near here have sought the immediate intervention of the district administration in demolishing an encroachment on the pathway to their apartment.The residents, in a petition submitted at the weekly grievances day meeting here on Monday, said attempts were made by some encroachers to build the toilet which would not only block their access but also result in health hazard.In this context, the petition referred to an earlier directive of the district administration to demolish the encroachment. “Apart from ignoring the directive, a fresh structure is being built in the area,” the petition said.
