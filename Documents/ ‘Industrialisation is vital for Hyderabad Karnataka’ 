Municipal Administration and Minorities Welfare Minister Qamarul Islam has said that the industrialisation of Hyderabad Karnataka is key for the development of the State and region. Launching a road show, ‘Invest-Kalaburagi 2016’ here on Saturday, Mr. Islam said that industrialisation would usher in inclusive development.Although the State had witnessed an impressive growth in industrial sector over the past several years, Hyderabad Karnataka remained industrially backward.He said that hopes for the region now rested on the new industrial policy. Kalaburagi district had a very good scope for industries including cement factories and allied industry, ginning mill, integrated lime stone units.Mr. Islam said that currently the production of cement was 45 tonnes per day and this would increase to 100 tonnes per day with the addition of three more major cement units in the district by the end of 2016. However, he said that the investors should come up with the proposal for setting up industries in sectors other than cement. The new areas including real estate, hospitals and tourism should be the thrust areas for future investments in the region.
