A day after accusing Opposition parties of misguiding farmers in the capital region, Telugu Rythu, the farmers’ wing of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), has submitted a memorandum to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) Commissioner, opposing the provisions in the draft master plan.Telugu Rythu district secretary M. Saibabu, along with Punadipadu villagers on Thursday urged the CRDA authorities to earmark Punadipadu and Gollagudem villages as residential zones instead of agricultural zones. The draft master plan had marked these villages as agricultural zones.The farmers submitted their memoranda to the Commissioner.Mr. Saibabu said the government in a GO 387/2008 issued on May 31, 2008 had earmarked major chunk of Punadipadu village as residential zone. The government acquired 14 acres for National Highway (NH)-9 for a km bypass road in 2011.Later, another GO 407 was issued on October 23, 2012 for extension of the Kankipadu-Uppaluru-Kesarapalli-Gannavaram airport road to 200 feet, he said.The farmers had welcomed the GOs, expecting that they would appreciate their lands value. Small and marginal farmers were hopeful, as junior colleges and residential apartments had come up in the village.Residential zone“But, the CRDA’s decision will bring the development process to a grinding halt,” he said adding: “The farmers wanted the government to recognise their village as residential zone.“They also wanted the government to extend the deadline for submission of objections and suggestions.”
