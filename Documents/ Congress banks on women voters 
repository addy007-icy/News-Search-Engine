The central theme was attracting the women voters by singing paeans of the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and her good deeds.The State Congress chief N. Uttam Kumar led from the front in stressing the point that it was the Congress government at the Centre which ensured empowerment of women.

Praising Ms Gandhi, the TPCC chief said it was only the AICC president, who kept her word to create Telangana. He appealed to the voters to back the Congress candidates because of the good work done by it.Former Union Minister S.
