Samaj Parivartan Samudaya of Dharwad will challenge a judgment of the High Court of Karnataka of December 3, 2015 on payment of forest development tax in a writ petition No. 2642/2009 (National Mineral Development Corporation vs State of Karnataka).Disclosing this at a press conference here on Sunday, S.R. Hiremath, president of the samudaya, said that the order of the High Court would have far reaching implications on the sovereign functions and powers of the State over forest produce and forest development under the law.“It (judgment passed by a Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice S.K. Mukherjee and Justice B.V. Nagarathna) is bound to have an impact on the custodial relationship the State has over resources as public trustee, besides depriving the State’s exchequer of such legitimate tax,” he said.Careful studyA careful study of the 425-page judgment, with help from legal luminaries, has revealed that the writ petition concerns interpretation and application of Section 98 (A) of the Karnataka Forest Act — (i) levy of Forest Development Tax at 12 per cent, (ii) such levy and collection by government/body, notified by the State government or otherwise, of forest produce to be deposited in the Forest Development Fund, constituted under Section 98 (B) of the Act, which was challenged by way of 97 writ petitions.The High Court, in essence (i) upheld the power of the State government to levy forest development tax and then its deposit in the Forest Development Fund. However, the judgment held that (i) the body is not a legal person, (ii) that the authorisation of the instructions issued to the body by the State government as ultra vires its powers, and (iii) that the body should refund all collections remitted in the Forest Development Fund, right from the beginning (amounting to Rs. 2,500 crore) till now, within three months as it had no legal status on behalf of the State, he pointed out.How this judgment would ensure suppression of mischief and advancement of remedy, attempted by the Supreme Court, is a question that still remains to be answered, he said.Some of the precedents cited in the judgment to rationalise the court order appear prima facieper incuriam and the interpretative techniques adopted are unwarranted, he added.“I consider this as another major fight against mining entities, after the legal battle against illegal mining activities in the Supreme Court, which exercised its extraordinary powers vested in the Constitution to cancel the mining leases of 51 entities/companies besides sending many to jail. Very soon, we will file our writ petition challenging the High Court order,” he added.
