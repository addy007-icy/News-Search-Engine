With the intervention of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, the perennial issue of terrorism is expected to get more attention in Pakistan (“After Kerry calls up Sharif, Pak. Promises quick action,” Jan.10). Mr. Kerry has called up the Pakistan Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, and insisted on the need for good bilateral relations through continuous talks. Mr. Sharif has also expressed his anti-terror stance and promised to take action to eliminate terror from his land. It is the wish of people from both nations to be friends. However, regular terror attacks make it a debatable option.The surprise visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Pakistan to greet Mr. Sharif on his birthday was an encouraging development for peace-lovers in India. But the Pathankot attacks have made it look like a mockery of peace. There is no use in befriending a smiling villain.Meenakshi Pattabiraman,MaduraiPakistan is on tenterhooks after the Pathankot incident, not so much due to India’s expected response but because Mr. Kerry has called upon Mr. Sharif to get to the bottom of the issue and ferret out the truth without delay. Pakistan can afford to play ducks and drakes with India but it cannot antagonise Uncle Sam as it relies heavily on the U.S. for financial and military assistance. However, the U.S. has an unsavoury reputation of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds and India would be making a mistake if it were to rely wholly on the Americans for justice and a complete halt to terrorist strikes from across the border. In the end, we have to fight our own battles and, having already given Pakistan a long rope, the time has come for drastic action. If covert strikes at terrorist bases are the only solution to this vexed problem, India should weigh the option seriously and also mobilise world opinion.C.V. Aravind,Bengaluru
