BCCI president Shashank Manohar, who has won some brownie points from the Supreme Court-appointed Justice Lodha Committee for putting in measures to bring transparency and accountability to the Board’s working and also appointing an ombudsman to adjudicate on conflict of interest issues, has gone a step further now by asking Board members to submit a list of cricketers involved in the administration of their association in the last 10 years.The members have been asked to submit by January 20, (1) cricketers elected as office-bearers of the association, (2) cricketers elected to the managing committee, (3) cricketers in the sub-committees of the association and the roles performed by them and (4) the welfare measures taken by the association for cricketers and umpires.Almost all associations have cricketers (Test and domestic first-class and club) elected or nominated as office-bearers, managing committee members and nominated to selection and technical committees.“An association cannot be run without cricketers. It’s impossible. They have always been part and parcel of selection committees and other committees where the game of cricket is of paramount importance. We have many associations which have had Test cricketers as secretaries. We don’t know why these details have been asked for,” said a secretary of the permanent Test centre and a president of another association.Justice Lodha had observed in his report that, “Surprisingly, the players who are the sport’s biggest draw are not spared from the apathy of the BCCI. They are treated less like assets and more as employees and subordinates of those governing the game. Cricketers have to be protected and given a free hand in cricketing affairs.”
