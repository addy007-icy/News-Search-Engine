District Tourism Promotion Council will launch a boat with facilities for collecting septage from houseboats.The council has got permission from Tourism Department to deploy a boat for the purpose. An amount of Rs.38 lakh had been allotted for buying the specialised boat, DTPC Secretary C. Pradip said.The boat will be able to collect septage from about 10 houseboats daily. The process is expected to help improve the waste management system in houseboats. At present, the boats are required to empty the septage at the waste treatment plant at Kuttanad.The boats are expected to make use of the facility every three months. The plant has the capacity to process the waste from only four boats daily.It is mandatory for the houseboats to empty the waste at least four times an year in order to renew the annual licence for operation. Several boats have not been able to meet the deadline owing to various reasons.About 1,200 houseboats are operating in Vembanad lake, but less than 800 have got themselves registered with the tourism authorities.It has been a challenge for the authorities to trace the unregistered boats in the absence of boats and enough personnel to man the monitoring operations.Some of the operators owning more than one boat are known to have made registration of only one boat.The unregistered boats often violate the norms on waste management, posing threat to pollution control efforts. A mobile waste collection boat is operating at Kumarakom. The operation has been found effective in tackling pollution in backwaters. The mobile unit would be helpful to the operators, as they didnâ€™t have to cancel the scheduled trips, thus enabling them to ensure smooth operations. DTPC was engaged in streamlining the houseboat operations by providing more amenities to ensure pollution-free journey, he said.
