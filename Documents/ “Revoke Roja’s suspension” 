: Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy has requested Speaker K. Sivaprasada Rao to revoke the suspension of his party MLA R.K. Roja respecting the time-tested business rules. The motion that was passed suspending Ms. Roja for a period of one year under Rule 340 (2) was against the provisions under the rule and hence, “illegal and unconstitutional.”In a letter addressed to the Speaker, Mr. Jagan said in accordance with the provisions under Rule 340, the Chair should put the motion to vote and suspend the member from the service of the House for a period not exceeding the remainder of the session. When the Legislative Affairs Minister moved the motion on December 18 for suspension of Ms. Roja, the Chair ought to have objected to the motion as it was against the provisions of the said rule. “The motion was adopted and this is very unfortunate and certainly a black day in the long history of the Assembly,” he said.
