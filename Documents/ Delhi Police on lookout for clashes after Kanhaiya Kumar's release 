Apprehending the possibility of “clashes” following the release of JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, Delhi Police have issued an “advisory” to all its district, traffic and PCR units asking them to maintain strict vigil, especially in and around the JNU and the Delhi University campuses.“The advisory says, in case Kanhaiya Kumar is bailed out, there is possibility that he may visit places which include Jantar Mantar, JNU and DU with large number of his supporters, largely including students’ groups like AISF and AISA, and members of some political parties,” a police source said on Thursday.“It further reads, ABVP and other right wing groups, including some political leaders, may oppose such gatherings and there is possibility of clashes among the groups.“Keeping in view the sensitivity and gravity of the matter, a sharp vigil and adequate arrangement by local police with sufficient women staff, PCR and Traffic are suggested to avoid any untoward incident,” the source said.The advisory was first issued when Delhi Police took a U-turn and opposed Mr. Kumar’s bail plea in the High Court. It was reissued on Wednesday, the source added.Mr. Kumar, who was arrested on February 12, 2016 in connection with a sedition case over a controversial JNU event, was on Wednesday granted interim bail for six months by the Delhi High Court which said that he has to cooperate in the ongoing investigation and has to present himself before the investigators as and when required.
