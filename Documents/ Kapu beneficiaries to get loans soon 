The Kapu Welfare and Development Corporation, formed by the State government, will soon extend loans to eligible beneficiaries from the Kapu community for setting up self-employment ventures, according to Chairman of the Corporation Chalamalasetti Ramunujaiah.Addressing a media conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Ramunujaiah said that the formation of the Kapu Corporation was an indication of the commitment of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and the Telugu Desam Party towards the Kapu community. He said that Deputy Chief Minister Nimmakayala Chinarajappa had earlier launched the website of the Corporation at a separate programme at the Government Circuit House here.Members of Kapu, Balija, Vantari and Telaga communities could apply for loans up to a maximum of Rs.2 lakh for setting up of small industries in urban areas and for agri-based industries in rural areas.Mr. Ramanujaiah said that eligible members of the community could apply for loans online (http://apobmms.cgg.gov.in.) The cheques would be distributed to the beneficiaries soon. The Chief Minister has appointed the Justice Manjunadh Committee to give report on the demand for inclusion of Kapus in the BC List. The committee was asked to submit its report within nine months. Replying to a query on Kapunadu leader Mudragada Padmanabham’s plans to conduct a ‘Kapu Mahasabha’, the Chairman felt that holding the meet now would serve no purpose as the Chief Minister had already conceded the demands of the community.
