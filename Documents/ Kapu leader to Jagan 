Chairman of the State Kapu Welfare and Development Corporation Ch. Ramanujaiah has asked YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy not to create unrest among communities at a time when the Justice Manjunatha Commission is on the job of listing Kapus in the BC category.At a press conference here on Wednesday, he said that when various Kapu associations met Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy before the Assembly elections in 2014 seeking his support for inclusion of the community in the BC list, he made a mockery of the demand and did not heed to the suggestion of Kapu leaders in the party to include the issue in the manifesto.The former Chief Minister, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, had promised to accord BC status to the community during the elections in 2004 and 2009 but he too failed to fulfil it, Mr. Ramanujaiah said.
