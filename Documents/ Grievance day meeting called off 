A farmersâ€™ grievance redressal meeting, which is scheduled to be held on Thursday at Muthu Arangam in Collectorate here, will not be held as per schedule, Collector M. Ravikumar said in a statement on Wednesday.Since officials from the departments of agriculture and horticulture had been involved in ascertaining damages caused to crops following rains during the northeast monsoon in 2015, the meeting could not be conducted.Moreover, special camps would also be organised in all taluks to facilitate affected farmers, he said.
