Three-member committee constituted by the State government and headed by retired IAS officer S. Chellappa to study about the inclusion of Valmiki Boya and Khaithi Lambada communities into Scheduled Tribe list faced an embarrassing moment when the tribal people of the district protested against the constitution of committee to include other communities into the ST list.The Chellappa committee visited Karimnagar on Tuesday to elicit opinion of different tribal communities about the inclusion of Valmiki Boya and Khaithi Lambada into ST list as promised by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao during the elections.During a meeting in Collectorate auditorium, the tribal leaders led by Tribal Political Joint Action Committee district coordinator Gagulothu Bheema Saheb raised a banner of revolt against the constitution of the committee and termed as unconstitutional.He said that the existing tribal people were unable to develop in spite of government providing reservations. Freshly, the inclusion of Valmiki Boya and Khaithi Lambada communities into the ST list would create further rift between them, he added. Stating that the Chellappa committee was not feasible, the tribal people raised slogans of “go back Chellappa committee”.District Adivasi Hakkula Porata Samithi general secretary Gurrala Ravinder suggested that the government should take up categorisation of STs also to benefit the reservation facilities to the needy sections. The Valmiki Boya community leaders urged the committee to include them in the ST list.
