Kapil Pandey, bowling coach of the UP U-19 team, was happy after his team downed Mumbai in the Cooch Behar Trophy final on Friday. He had worked for Indian Navy in the city, and also played local cricket. He said: “I know what it’s like to beat Mumbai. I am proud that UP was able to beat Mumbai. I know a lot about the wickets here. That’s why we played two seamers and two spinners. I advised left-arm spinners Shanu Saini and Trishal Trivedi to practise spot bowling. My experience of Mumbai conditions became useful.”
