Rajya Sabha Member V. Hanumanth Rao of the Congress on Wednesday charged the Bharatiya Janata Party of playing politics with the incident concerning the suicide by University of Hyderabad (UoH) research scholar Rohith Vemula.“AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited the campus on humanitarian grounds and because he was concerned over the social boycott,” he said by way of a reply to BJP national vice-president Muralidhar Rao’s comments over Mr. Gandhi’s trip to the UoH on Tuesday.Addressing a modest gathering of students, research scholars and social activists on the campus here, he continued his accusations, saying that the BJP had engineered the appointment of an ‘RSS man’ in the post of Vice-Chancellor in the UoH. He said that despite the visits of so many political leaders over the past four days, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao should visit the campus and extend help and support to the bereaved family.
