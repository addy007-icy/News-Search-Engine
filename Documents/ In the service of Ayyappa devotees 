The Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom (ABASS), an organisation of Ayyappa devotees across the globe, is doing yeoman service round the clock to the multitude of pilgrims visiting the Sabarimala temple.The ABASS has deployed as many as 750 volunteers at Sabarimala, Pampa, Nilackal, Appachimedu, Neelimala, Pandithavalam, Valiyanavattom, Cheriyanavattom, and Nilackal since the beginning of the pilgrim season in mid-November, says N. Velayudhan Nair, sanghom president. Besides this, 300 volunteers are deployed at Erumely, Pandalam, Chengannur, and at Karimala on the traditional trekking path.Formation in 1945Mr. Nair said the Sanghom that came into being in 1945, even before the formation of the Travancore Devaswom Board, had been offering Annadanam, free stretcher service, health care, and medicated drinking at Sabarimala and various base camps of the pilgrims for the past seven decades.The pilgrimsâ€™ camp at Karimala is the lone solace to the pilgrims on the forest path leading to Sabarimala from Erumely. TDB president Prayar Gopalakrishnan too claimed to have experienced the benevolence of the Sanghom volunteers during his recent visit to Karimala as part of an inspection on the path.Devotees find the food and drinking water offered by the Sanghom at Sabarimala, Pampa, and various other base camps a great solace. Even the Kerala High Court has permitted the Sanghom to continue with their Annadanam offering at Sabarimala.Stretcher unitThe 150-strong emergency volunteer force attached to the stretcher unit headed by Thanchavur Damodaran is the mainstay of the ABASS at Sabarimala.Mr. Damodaran from Chennai has been heading the stretcher unit for the pat 30 years.The unit presently has 40 stretchers stationed at Sannidhanam, Saramkuthi, Marakkoottom, Appachimedu and Neelimala, he says.Mr. Damodaran who was an assistant director in Telugu films, says he had reached Sabarimala for a 15-day voluntary service 30 years ago, only to become a full-time volunteer.According to him, he has carried around 800 bodies from Sannidhanam to Pampa over the past three decades, besides shifting over 4,000 patients to various hospitals.
