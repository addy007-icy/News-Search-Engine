A group of activists petitioned Collector G. Govindaraj on Monday seeking action against people who allegedly sold 16-acre agriculture land at Sivanmalai for construction of houses by forging documents.R. Senthil Kumar, one of the petitioners, told reporters that the conversion took place by forging the revenue documents. So, the authorities should take action against both the violations and arrest the people behind the scam.The activists said they had already brought the issue to the notice of senior revenue officials some months ago, but no action was taken.In another representation to the Collector, a group of people from Dalit community from Maruppagoundenpalayam complained that a pathway used by them was blocked by some people. “Due to this, children from the area have to walk extra miles to reach the bus stop,” they said.Another group of Dalits from Kundadam complained that the false case registered against them of assaulting a person many months ago was not yet withdrawn.
