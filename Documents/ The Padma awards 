The list of Padma awardees this year is disappointing (“Pushing limits, stretching goals: India’s tour de force”, Jan.26). Scrutiny reveals that there is a tilt towards those from the north. Not one classical Carnatic music artiste, vocal or instrumental, has been honoured. The name of music director M.S. Viswanathan could have been considered. National honours are an indication of the mindset and intentions of the juries. If such blatant acts of discrimination are carried out, there is no point in talking about national integration.V. Lakshmanan,TirupurThe list this year is “representative in character” by including persons from across social groups. The award winners are luminaries in their fields of activity and will definitely inspire others. As a retired lecturer I feel sad that hardly anyone from the academic field has been considered this time around.M. Somasekhar Prasad,Badvel, Andhra PradeshAs usual, the Padma awards have been announced and the question that arises is whether these awardees are truly deserving of the honour. It is clear in one instance that loyalty to the BJP government has been rewarded and it’s the same about the Gujarat connection. The system of selection needs to be changed, failing which these awards will only be construed as being a mandatory ritual.Subha Pitchaiah,PuducherryA quick perusal of the list for 2016 makes it clear that these civilian awards are still “loyalty awards” in the actual sense. Lobbying and the Union government’s nod are the criteria required. Some individuals have made contributions in their respective fields but their “connections” with the government cannot be ignored. It would be welcome if the number of Padma awards every year is reduced.K.B. Dessai,Margao, Goa
