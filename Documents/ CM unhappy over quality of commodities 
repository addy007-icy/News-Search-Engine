Expressing dissatisfaction over the poor quality of commodities being supplied to the public under ‘Sankranthi Kanuka,’ Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday made it clear that stringent action would be initiated against those who resort to cheat the public by way of compromising on the quality of groceries.
