With the International Fleet Review (IFR) dates coming close, the district police appear to be a bit worried over the recent spurt of Maoist activity in the Agency area, especially in the cut off area on the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB).According to District Superintendent of Police Koya Praveen, the Maoists have been active in certain pockets in the Agency areas, for the last one year.Their presence has increased in places such as Pedabayalu, Munchingput and G. Madugula, especially after the formation of the Malkangiri-Visakhapatnam- Koraput (MVK) division.The MVK division was formed last year to concentrate in the cut off area of the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB). Earlier, the area was being taken care of by the East Division, and now it has been moved to the East Godavari region, to regain its lost ground.The MVK division which is headed by Venu, has been active and its cadres comprise mostly of Gutti Koya tribals and Girijans from the Koraput area of Odisha, said the SP.“The recent killings of a couple of innocent people including a former Sarpanch of Jerela, after branding them as police informers, indicate their active presence. None of the killed persons had any touch with the police, but were once Maoist sympathisers. They are using the killing method to spread fear among the locals and to deter them from getting close to the government machinery,” Mr. Praveen told The Hindu .To counter the movement, the police have moved additional forces in the Agency area and have intensified the combing operations.
