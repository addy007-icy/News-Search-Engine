Nilaji Gram Panchayat office under Kudachi Assembly Constituency in Raibag taluk was on Monday witness to an unusual happening with one of its members locking one of the office rooms in haste and P. Rajeev, MLA, forcing the officials to break open the lock on the issue of distribution of ownership titles to beneficiaries under a housing scheme.According to sources, a member locked the room as Mr. Rajeev was late by an hour to distribute the ownership titles and left the premises.About 250 beneficiaries and other members and officials of the panchayat were waiting for Mr. Rajeev to start the function scheduled at noon.However, Mr. Rajeev arrived after an hour as he had to attend another function.On learning about how the member had left the panchayat in anger in protest over Mr. Rajeev taking the panchayat membersâ€™ time for granted, the MLA asked the officials to open the room where the titles were kept and subsequently, distributed the deeds to the beneficiaries.Mr. Rajeev later told newsmen that some of the members were collecting money from gullible beneficiaries.As he had prevented them from looting the poor beneficiaries, some of the panchayat members were angry with him.
