Additional Collector and Project Director of District Rural Development Agency (Madurai) B. Rohini Ramdas has urged the children not to feel inferior for being economically poor and instead approach life with confidence to become what they aspire for.Speaking at the 16{+t}{+h}annual day celebration of the SEED PLAN, an NGO working with underprivileged children, Ms. Rohini recollected how she, hailing from a village in Maharashtra and studying till Class 10 in a government school, managed to become an IAS officer. “Don’t feel inferior that you cannot wear stylish uniforms or study in expensive schools. You are as talented as those studying in expensive schools. All that matters is perseverance and self-confidence,” she said.Fondly remembering the perseverance shown by the children of the SEED PLAN in inviting her for the function, Ms. Rohini asked the students to retain the same perseverance in their life.She asked the children that they need not look at life as a competition with others but instead cooperate with others so that there was growth for everyone. On Police Boys and Girls Club in Karumbalai, of which many of the SEED PLAN children are members, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) of Anna Nagar Range B. Sakthivel said that he was overwhelmed to see the talent shown by the club children in various spheres.
