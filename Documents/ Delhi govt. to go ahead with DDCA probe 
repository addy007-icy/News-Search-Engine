The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government made it clear on Friday that the Commission of Inquiry constituted by it will go ahead with the probe into alleged irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) despite the Centre declaring it null and void.The Union Home Ministry has termed the Commission of Inquiry null and void in a letter sent to the Delhi Lieutenant Governor. The Home Ministry officials said The Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 only empowers the Central and State governments to order a probe and the Delhi government had no power to take any disciplinary action as it is not a 'full-state'.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, reasoned that the Commission was appointed in accordance with the law. In a flurry of tweets on Friday, Mr. Kejriwal said —“DDCA Enquiry Commission set up by Delhi Govt (government) is as per law and the Constitution of India. The Centre’s opinion not binding on Del govt. The Commission will continue work. If LG (Lieutenant Governor) or MHA or PMO (Prime Minister Office) aggrieved, they may approach Court. Only a court order can stop commission’s work.”Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung had asked the Centre for its opinion on the Commission of Inquiry, following which the Centre replied on Thursday that it was null and void and the Delhi government had no power to conduct such inquiry.The Delhi government has appointed the former Solicitor General, Gopal Subramaniam, to head the probe panel.DDCA ScamWhat - The AAP alleged huge financial irregularities in DDCA during Arun Jaitley’s 13 year-old tenure as its chief, saying large amounts were siphoned off through fake companies besides other irregularities including in team selection.When - BJP MP and former cricketer Kirti Azad had earlier in 2014 alleged irregularities in the functioning of DDCA.
