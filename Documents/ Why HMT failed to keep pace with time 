Those who have had a long association with HMT Watches Ltd. blame the shoddy management and corruption in the early 1990s as the main reason for HMT’s decline that willingly let new private players enter the Indian watch market.“When Titan watches emerged in the market, they poached most of the top technicians from HMT, which was never corrected,” a former employee said.The death blow came when HMT closed down its Research and Development division in the late 1990s robbing the company any chance of competing with private players, a senior employee said.
