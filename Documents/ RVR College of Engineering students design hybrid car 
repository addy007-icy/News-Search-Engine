Students of Mechanical Engineering Department in RVR & JC College of Engineering have given shape to their innovative ideas and designed a hybrid car all by themselves.The students formed into a team, ‘Falcon Racers’, to design a hybrid car which runs on alternative energy sources for the ‘Hybrid Vehicle Challenge’ event to be organised by Imperial Society of Innovative Engineers from January 24 to 27 at RPM Racing Circuit, Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh.Led by V. Anil Kumar, a student of third year mechanical engineering, his team designed the vehicle using double wishbone suspension which are often used in high-end cars and hydraulic brakes, the standard in automobiles.Principal A. Sudhakar said that the college management gave Rs.2 lakh in support of the venture.Head of Department, Mechanical Engineering, K. Ravindra said that hybrid car was a high speed vehicle running on alternative battery power and it was energy efficient. While running on the engine, the motor would act as a dynamo and charges the 48 V battery. While the car is running, it charge the 12 V battery which would be used for auxiliary circuit.Faculty members NVVS Sudhir, KRS Srinivasa Rao and K. Siva also assisted the students in the project.
