The government is firming up a strategy to prevent ‘attempts’ by rich nations to introduce ‘new pro-corporate issues’ such as global value chains, digital economy, labour and climate-related trade into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) deliberations and negotiations on mega free trade agreements, officials say.When the Doha Round negotiations (for a global agreement to lower trade barriers) resume at the WTO headquarters in Geneva, India will make it clear that discussions on any ‘new issue’ can take place only after resolving all the outstanding matters related to the Doha Round talks, official sources told The Hindu.The development came after > India had opposed the declaration brought out after the WTO’s ministerial conference (its highest decision making body) in Nairobi last month as it did not include measures primarily meant for improving trade prospects of developing and poor nations.The outstanding issues include an effective ‘Special Safeguard Mechanism’ (or a tool to help developing countries protect the interests of their poor farmers by temporarily increasing duties to counter farm import increase and price fall) and a permanent solution for the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes.Two criteriaIndia will state at the WTO that any country pitching for the introduction the ‘new issues’ will first have to ensure that they meet two criteria.One is to establish the relevance of these issues in the context of trade and the other to ensure that there is a consensus among all 162 WTO member countries in taking up such an agenda.Simultaneously, > India will strengthen the alliance of developing and poor countries to put an end to the attempts to introduce 'new issues' into the WTO talks at this stage, sources said.These ‘new issues’ that the developed world is keen to introduce into the WTO’s Doha Round talks include global value chains, e-commerce, labour, climate-related trade (such as environmental services and goods), competition policies, investment pacts, government procurement and state-owned enterprises, on all of which the rich nations have superior standards or rules than the developing and poor countries.The developing nations feel these standards or rules might therefore become non-tariff barriers, hurting their exports to rich nations while the latter will be able to indirectly open up the developing markets through an agenda that includes 'new issues'.In the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) talks too, India will state that the focus should be on expeditiously concluding discussions on the goods, services and investment chapters of the pact.Pointing out to the presence of some rich countries in the RCEP grouping — which are also a part of the U.S.-led Trans Pacific Partnership (another similar mega free trade pact) that has higher standards than the RCEP, the sources said India will oppose their attempts to bring in any “non-trade and WTO-plus” issues such as labour and environment into the RCEP.
