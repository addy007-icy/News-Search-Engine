Minister for Mines and Geology and district-in-charge Vinay Kulkarni has called upon local entrepreneurs and industrialists to diversify in their respective ventures instead of waiting for bigger companies to invest in Hubballi-Dharwad.He was inaugurating the ‘Dharwad District Investors’ Meet’ organised as part of ‘Invest Karnataka’, a global investors’ meet being planned by the State government, here on Saturday.Pointing out the geographical advantages of Hubballi-Dharwad, Mr. Kulkarni said that despite being in a good location and having good connectivity and potential, industrial growth in the twin cities was not up to the mark. He said that the State government was making efforts to attract investments and would also act as a facilitator for industrial growth in the region. The Minister promised to give quick clearances to projects while maintaining transparency.Clarifying that there was no dearth of land for the industries in the region, he said that the administration had 1,348 acres of land in its possession, which would be made available for industries. Mr. Kulkarni said that the process for acquiring around 9,000 acres of land in the State was under progress.Delivering keynote address at the meet, industry expert Aravind Chinchure pointed out that despite various initiatives by the government, the twin-cities lacked the infrastructure required for industries and there was dire need for addressing the issue immediately.He said that the future belonged to the start-ups and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and infrastructure, innovation, investment, institution and information were essential for their development.KSRTC vice-chairman Lohit Naikar, CM’s Parliamentary Secretary C.S. Shivallai, President of the Karnatak Chamber of Commerce and Industry Rames Patil and Deputy Commissioner Rajendra Cholan were present.
