With the Centre directing the major ports to become landlord ports as part of Maritime Agenda-2020, Visakhapatnam Port is witnessing a turf war among BOT operators as well as the stevedores to have their slice of cake from dwindling bulk cargo.Among the BOT operators, four PPP investors are licensed to handle bulk cargo. The operators have invested in the entire landside infrastructure and are charging prefixed tariffs for the services offered by them.Vizag Port being a major port, the tariffs are regulated by the TAMP regime unlike the non-major ports. The PPP operators pass on royalty ranging from 17 per cent to 58 per cent to the port.BOT operators say stevedores invest meagre or no amount and utilise old port infrastructure.They pay no revenue share thereby enabling them to offer cheaper rate to the users.The PPP operators can only handle rail-bound cargo. Some PPP operators have resorted to handling road-bound cargo beyond Concession Agreement conditions thereby leading to heartburn among rivals.For instance, highly-placed sources told The Hindu that Vizag Seaports Private Limited (VSPL), the first BOT operator, lodged a complaint on December 30 last against Adani Vizag Coal Terminal Pvt Ltd (AVCPTL) Coal Terminal.Following the complaint, the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) suspended the Consent for Operations (COF) vide its order No. 2010.VSP/PCB/ZO-VSP/Tech/2015-1836 dated January 11. The Hindu has obtained a copy of the order.Similarly, complaints are also heard on others on misinterpretation of permission granted by the APPCB on handling residual cargo – the quantity leftover after moving cargo by rail wagons. In the CFO order, the APPCB stipulated a specific condition for BOT operators that “there shall not be any coal cargo movement right from berth to the stock pile up to final dispatch by trucks/dumpers as committed in the Consent for Establishment.”With the completion of Inner Harbour dredging to handle fully laden Panamax vessels with 14.5 metres draft without lightening at the Outer Harbour, there is now a flexibility to distribute the cargo.When contacted, a senior official of the Visakhapatnam Port told this correspondent there was some confusion regarding permission to handle residual cargo by road by the BOT operators and they would strictly adhere to whatever orders the APPCB would issue from time to time.Some PPP operators resort to handling road-bound cargo beyond Concession Agreement conditions
