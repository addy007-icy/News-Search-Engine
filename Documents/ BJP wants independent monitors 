The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday appealed to Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan to ensure that free and fair polls were held for the civic body, scheduled for February.A delegation of senior BJP leaders led by its floor leader K. Laxman, N. Indrasena Reddy, Nagam Janardhan Reddy, N.V.S.S. Prabhakar, B. Venkat Reddy, Venkata Ramani and others submitted a memorandum to the Governor, seeking the appointment of an independent team of observers to monitor the GHMC polls as they apprehend free and fair elections may not be possible.The leaders sought the Governor’s intervention “in instructing the government not to meddle with electioneering”. They charged the TS government of moving heaven and earth to subvert the democratic process since it had tried to cut down the duration of electioneering process, delay in announcement of reservation of wards and the controversy surrounding the deletion of names from the voters’ lists.In a separate memorandum to Mr. Narasimhan, the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee too sought his intervention in ensuring that the TS government hold the civic body polls as per law as it had resorted to several “undemocratic and dictatorial methods to win the polls”. Led by its chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, Ponnala Lakshamiah, Danam Nagender, Anjan Kumar Yadav, M. Mukesh, Banda Karthika Reddy and others, the party sought an inquiry by an appropriate agency to source the income of the ruling TRS as it had spent crores of rupees on hoardings.
