: Officials of the Geology and Revenue Departments have collected evidence of large-scale quarrying in Peruvampoil — an overexploited village in Kozhikode district where the State government has invested a huge fund for various soil conservation initiatives under its watershed management programme.Mining and Geology Department officers visited the area following a directive from the Kozhikode district committee.Revenue Department officials made their visit after a complaint was filed by the Peruvampoil Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti to the Revenue Divisional Officer on the impact of the rampant quarrying in the area.Action committee leaders said government representatives were convinced about the issues raised by the residents in the area during their visits to some of the affected areas.“The weathered sand deposit on either side of the Peruvampoil rivulet and the health issues faced by people with the functioning of large number of crusher units have been brought to the attention of the team,” they said.“As part of our continuing fight to protect the area, we are planning to submit a fresh complaint to the Union Ministry of Forest and Environment for quick action,” said William Paulose, a leader of the action committee.He said one of the main requests to be put forth to the government would be on conducting a comprehensive survey on the impact of quarrying in the watershed area and the natural water resources.In the complaint earlier submitted to the consideration of various government bodies, including the Western Ghat Protection Committee, the leaders of the Peruvampoil Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti had alleged that around 600 hectares of land covered in the watershed management project faced threat due to rampant quarrying in four wards of the Kodiyathur grama panchayat.As per the official records, the panchayat had invested around Rs. 62.47 lakh for various conservation measures in the marked watershed area.600 hectares of land affected in watershed area‘Huge deposit of weathered sand in rivulets’
