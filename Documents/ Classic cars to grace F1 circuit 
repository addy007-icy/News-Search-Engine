Each vintage car tells a story of survival. At the centre of it all, is the owner who, over the years, has treated the car like family — by giving it a place to live, spending money on it and instilling in future generations a love for cars so that the machine is passed on as an heirloom. That is why vintage car owners, who are part of an elite club that preserves heritage, stand proudly next to their gleaming machines.The public will be given an opportunity to see this preserved heritage up close and watch them race in a controlled environment at the Sixth 21 Gun Salute Vintage Car Rally and Concours Show.The cars will be on display at the Red Fort on February 6. On February 7, a rally will be flagged off from the Red Fort. It will culminate at the Buddh International Circuit, followed by ceremonial drive and category races.This edition of the show will see vintage car owners from abroad flying down their cars in order to participate in the show. The Union Ministry of Tourism has also stepped in to promote vintage car rallies and will be making arrangements for Indian car owners to participate in shows abroad as well.Speaking about the event, 21 Gun Salute Heritage and Cultural Trust founder and managing trustee Madan Mohan said this year will see participation by 125 handpicked classic cars. He added that this year’s highlight is that vintage and classic cars will race at controlled speeds on the Formula 1 circuit.Mr. Mohan said some of the prized beauties that have confirmed participation include cars dating back from the pre-war era of 1886 to the glorious time of 1965 from the houses of Rolls Royce, Stutz, Buick, Ford, Chevrolet, Austin Martin and Bentley. One of the most precious automobile on display will be the first car by Karl Friedrich Benz and a Quadra cycle by Henry Ford.
