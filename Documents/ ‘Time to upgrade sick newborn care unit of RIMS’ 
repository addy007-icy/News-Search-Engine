Not all infants are as lucky as the four-month-old daughter of Debbadiwar Vijayalakshmi and Rakesh, whose life could be saved, at the Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Adilabad, even though her weight at birth was as dangerously low as 650 gm against a normal of 2,500 gm.Despite the best efforts of doctors at the unit, over 14 per cent of the 2,167 sick children have died, mainly due to low birth weight, since the inception of the facility on April 1, 2014.The grimness of the situation can be understood from the fact that 37 of the 52 babies born with less than 1,000 gm of weight at birth have died at the SNCU so far. Similarly, 81 of the 301 babies with a birth weight between 1,000 gm and 1,499 gm and 103 of the 934 with birth weight between 1,500 gm and 2,499 gm have died.The unit has cared for 1,287 infants with low birth weight so far of whom 221 have died owing to deficiencies at the SNCU like oxygen supply. There would certainly be more deaths of low birth weight infants if the SNCU is not upgraded from the present level 2 as level 3 care unit, opine doctors at the RIMS.“Yes, the unit needs to be upgraded sooner than later as the intake of babies with low birth weight and with other illnesses is on the rise,” concurs Suryakant Mundlod, nodal officer of the SNCU.“We are referring children even for ventilation to hospitals in Hyderabad which is a good 300 km away from here,” he points out adding that a proposal has already been made to the Commissioner of Family Welfare for upgradation.“Also needed is a concerted campaign to create awareness among people in rural areas over the importance of nutritional food for pregnant women. Almost 80 per cent of the low birth weight babies are born due to the mother suffering of anaemia, which is a result of lack of nutrition,” the SNCU nodal officer revealed.According to statistics maintained at the unit, a majority of the mothers weigh between 40 kg and 45 kg and have a very low haemoglobin level of 2 or 3.“Besides food, the quality of water consumed by women, which is often greatly chlorinated, also causes ill-health among them,” Dr. Suryakant added.
