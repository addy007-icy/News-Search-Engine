As the three-day celebrations of Sankranti festival ended, the traffic on NH-65 towards Hyderabad from Vijayawada peaked on Sunday evening with hundreds of four-wheelers bound from different parts of Andhra Pradesh coming to a grinding halt at the toll plazas in the district.There was heavy rush of vehicles heading towards Hyderabad as people who visited their villages in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh began to return. Staff at toll-gate on the highway at Panthagi said that they were expecting the number of vehicles proceeding towards Hyderabad from Vijayawada to touch 80,000 on Sunday night.They said the number of vehicles on this highway usually touches 40,000 on ordinary days. In contrast, the vehicular flow towards Vijayawada was less than normal.Speaking to The Hindu , a software engineer S. Raj Kumar, native of Mangalagiri, said that they were all going to Hyderabad to resume their duties since Sunday was the last holiday.Meanwhile, the police deployed additional forces at both the Panthangi and Korlapahad toll gates and other important places apart from placing stoppers at various places to regulate the traffic. The toll gate management created additional ways for Hyderabad-going vehicles streamlining the movement of vehicles coming in the opposite direction to ease the traffic congestion.There was heavy traffic jam on Addanki-Narketpally State highway too.As there are only three ways to collect the toll for vehicles going either side at Madgulapally toll-gate, the facility proved inadequate for the increased vehicular inflow on the road that connects Prakasam and Guntur districts with Telangana. Vehicles coming from Andhra Pradesh side were seen waiting in a 2-km line at Madgulapally toll-gate. The Nagarjunasagar-Hyderabad State highways also witnessed heavy traffic flow on Sunday evening.
