Farmers of Srikakulam district are unlikely to celebrate Sankranti, thanks to inordinate delay in procurement of paddy in many places. The government is expected to procure around 4.8 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in the district. But the procurement has not crossed even 80,000 metric tonnes. The government declared Rs.1,440 per quintal as MSP for fine quality and Rs.1,410 for the second variety. According to officials, nearly 109 procurement centres have been set up in the district but many of them are non-functional due to various reasons.According to sources, the government has not released Rs. 4 crore to the women SHGs which handled procurement centres in 2014-15. Many centres are not set up in border areas fearing that Odisha farmers would bring their produce in the name of locals. The farmers are reluctant to sell paddy in those centres as the government made it clear that they had to bear transport charges. Dues of the previous years were not released and new rules came into force. It has forced many to sell their produce to middlemen at Rs.1,200 to Rs.1,250 per quintal.“Last year, we lost crop to Hudhud. This time, the yield is good but there is no mechanism to pay MSP. The centres are yet to function in many places. We won’t get money before Sankranti, meaning the celebration will take a backseat,” Krishnam Naidu of Gara mandal.Procurement yet yo cross 80,000 MT as compared tothe target of4.8 lakh MT
