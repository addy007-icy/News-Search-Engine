Rosaiah said here on Saturday.Addressing the golden jubilee celebrations of the local chapter of the Indian Council for Child Welfare, Mr. Rosaiah observed that with nearly one third of our population below 14 years of age, it was imperative to provide them a good environment to blossom.“We have an onerous responsibility to mould and shape their conditions in the best possible way,” he said.Pointing out that there were several voluntary organisations active in the field of child welfare, he said what was required was a far sighted approach in helping the disadvantaged and poor children to enjoy a secured life and future.“We have miles to go to ensure a bright future for the children in all spheres of activity,” he said.PatAppreciating the Indian Council for Child Welfare in ensuring right and productive atmosphere for holistic development of children under their care, he expressed the hope that the avenues the council had created to give opportunities for excellent learning to realise their full potential would enable their successful transition.Later, he unveiled the golden jubilee plaque, released a souvenir, honoured contributors and meritorious students on the occasion.
