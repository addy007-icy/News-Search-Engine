Shops that sell helmets are not jumping the gun yet. Shopkeepers said they will start buying extra stock only after the rule kicks in. Padmanaban, who has a helmet shop in New Thippasandra, said there was talk of introducing the rule for pillion riders for months now. “In November, we bought 200 to 300 extra helmets… but had no sales as the rule was not implemented. Now, we will just wait till it is actually implemented,” he said.There are others who are already questioning the effective implementation of the rule. “At present, there is no crackdown on helmets that are not ISI certified, which defeats the purpose of making helmets mandatory. I don’t see this new rule being implemented effectively,” said Stephen, another shopkeeper.
