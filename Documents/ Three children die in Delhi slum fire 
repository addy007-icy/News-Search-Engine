Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal on Sunday visited a slum cluster in northeast Delhi’s New Usmanpur area, where three children of a family died in a fire on Saturday night, and said she will take up the matter with Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DLSA) to seek compensation for the victims’ kin.“Though nothing can compensate such a huge loss (of lives), we will write to the DLSA seeking compensation for the family of the victims,” Ms. Maliwal said.“The family is very poor; they had a tarpaulin sheet on their head. So when it burnt, the mother managed to escape but it fell on the children. The mother was inconsolable,” she said.Maliwal said a doctor was called to the spot during her visit and the mother was rushed to a nearby hospital.The fire broke out around 11.30 pm on Saturday night, following which eight fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Police said a short circuit could have lead to explosions from three cooking gas cylinders.The deceased have been identified as Reena, Meena and six-month-old Mubarak.
