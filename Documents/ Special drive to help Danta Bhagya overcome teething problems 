A good one year after its launch, the State government’s ambitious Danta Bhagya scheme — to provide free dentures to senior citizens with complete tooth loss — has barely reached 1,000 people.Lack of awareness about the scheme among people, delay in disbursement of funds to dental colleges, apart from some technical glitches, are said to be the main reasons for the slow progress. The Health Department is now planning a massive awareness camp simultaneously in all districts on January 8, where people will not just be screened but also provided with dentures on the spot.Oral Health Policy Committee chairperson Ganesh Shenoy Panchmal told The Hindu that the services of ASHA workers, which is vital to popularise the scheme, could not be utilised for several months as the software that lists the schemes for payment of incentives to the workers did not mention ‘Danta Bhagya’. “It has been included now following which ASHA workers will get Rs. 100 for every case they refer to the college,” he said.The scheme was aimed at providing free dentures to at least 30,000 senior citizens (aged 60 or above) belonging to the below poverty line families. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah launched the scheme with much fanfare on December 7, 2014.A senior health official said that the district health officers had been instructed to initiate measures to popularise the programme. With 11 districts in the State not having dental colleges, those from neighbouring districts have been directed to organise camps and create awareness there. The department is expecting to screen at least 20,000 people at the camps.“ASHA workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes (ANM) have been directed to identify eligible people in their jurisdiction and bring them to the hospitals,” the official said.The department had entered into a memorandum of understanding with 45 government and private hospitals for the implementation of the scheme. The Government’s Oral Health Policy Committee will monitor the camps and the implementation of the scheme, he said.
