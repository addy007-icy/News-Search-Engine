Vehicles that were damaged in the recent floods and are being repaired have taken up a good portion of the road and pavement on Third Main Road in Nolambur.Residents say a service centre on this stretch which is undertaking repairs of these cars, has parked many of these cars along the stretch.“Earlier, homeless people and eateries occupied a good portion of the road. Now, the footpath is occupied by four-wheelers too,” said 72-year-old S. Ramakrishnan, a resident of Nolambur.Taking advantage of this, other private vehicles, especially transport vans, autorickshaws and mini-lorries, have started using the pavement as ‘parking space’.Many motorists are finding it a challenge to take Third Main Road as, following the rains, the stretch is full of potholes. The parked vehicles have made the stretch narrow.Third Main Road, which connects Nolambur with Padi, a distance of around 4 km, is a short route to reach Anna Nagar and Tirumangalam from Ambattur, Mannurpet, Thirumullavoyal, J.J. Nagar and Maduravoyal. Also, motorists from the interior parts of Mogappair East, Ambattur, Padi, Korattur, Nolambur and Anna Nagar West use the stretch to reach places like Maduravoyal, Porur and Tambaram via the Chennai Bypass Road.“We will ensure that private cars and other vehicles are not parked on the stretch,” said a Corporation official.
