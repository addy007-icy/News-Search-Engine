Residents of various localities, under the banner of the Ballari Nagarikara Horata Samiti, staged a dharna on Tuesday outside the city corporation office to protest against inadequate civic amenities.The protesters criticised the city corporation for erratic supply of drinking water, improper disposal of garbage, awful condition of interior roads, among other things.Somashekar Goud, convener of the samiti, condemned the negligent attitude of the corporation authorities in providing basic civic amenities by handling the resources properly. “Garbage pile up at every corner, but they are not removed, water is being supplied once in seven to eight days and the city has tuned out to be a haven for pigs and stray cattle. Yet the authorities have turned their blind eye towards the plight of the people,” he said. M. N. Manjula, member of the samiti, expressed concern over the inordinate delay over completing a flyover at Satyanarayanpet and not cleaning the underpass, which had become a cess pool.V.P. Uddihal, Rama Rao, Murtuza Sab, Dr. Pramod, Radhakrishna Upadya, D. Shanta were among other senior members in the lead. Later, the leaders met Labour Minister P.T. Parmeshwar Naik and Anil Lad, MLA, and urged them to address the problems.
