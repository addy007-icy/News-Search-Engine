Pre-University lecturers and principals have threatened to boycott evaluation of answer scripts of the upcoming exams if the government does not settle the issue of parity in wages.Those belonging to Karnataka State Pre-university College Lecturers’ Association (KSPCLA) and Karnataka State Pre-university College Principals’ Association (KSPCPA) will go on a hunger strike on Wednesday at Freedom Park in Bengaluru.KSPCLA president Thimmaiah Purle said their requests for the past four years to implement the recommendations of the Kumar Nayak Committee, which was submitted in August 2011, had not been fulfilled. “The assurance by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in April also remains unfulfilled. If the government did not implement the recommendations now, we will be at great loss as the 7th Pay Commission would be constituted in 2017,” he said.KSPCPA president K.T. Srikante Gowda said the agitation is to demand rights and not against the government.
