Veteran actor Rekha was honoured with the Yash Chopra Memorial Award on Monday evening in Mumbai for her contribution to the film industry.The award has been instituted by the T S R. Foundation of T Subbarami Reddy in the memory of the producer-director, who died in 2012.“I am honoured to be bestowed with this award in Yashji’s memory. Yashji taught me how to love and I am eternally grateful for the memories and films I have had the privilege to be part of. I can only say this is not the climax. This is only the best phase of my life and there is a lot more to come. What I learnt from Yashji is that if you love someone, then you should love with all your heart so that there is no scope of loving anything else,” Rekha said.
