As the writer has rightly said, the road from Pathankot should be cautious and unconventional (“The road from Pathankot”, Jan. 22). If India does not resume talks with Pakistan, this would mean a victory for those behind the attacks and will be foreign policy setback. Now that the equations in Asia are changing with Pakistan’s dynamic engagement with China on the Silk Road initiative and with Russia on the Su-35 fighter planes, the non-engagement policy will not suit the situation. Instead, hastening the talk process for better outcomes, more engagement between the people of both nations, and tightening security along the border will help improve relations.Sastry Pokkuluri,HyderabadIn Pakistan, besides the people’s representative government, the power centres include the military and terrorist organisations. This is why Pakistan’s relations with India cannot be decided only by a representative government. And unfortunately and importantly, as democracy has not acquired significant meaning in Pakistan, military and terrorist organisations have a greater role in deciding Pakistan’s foreign policy than even the government does.Mayuresh Jagtap,Pune
