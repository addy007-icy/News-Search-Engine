: With the drop in temperatures, the Delhi government has directed its schools to suspend primary classes for three days and private schools to alter their timings.While private schools have been asked to amend their timings themselves, directions have been issued to government schools to start an hour later than their usual time.“Government has suspended primary classes for the next three days in wake of the chilly weather. Besides, we have also issued an advisory to the private schools in this regard,” said Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia.“Due to the ongoing cold weather and the forecast that the temperature may dip further, it has been decided that primary classes (class KG to V) will remain suspended from January 21-23,” a circular by the Directorate of Education (DoE) said.“Morning shift and general shift in government schools will start an hour later than usual and similarly evening shift will close an hour early. All private and unaided schools are advised to amend their timings,” it added.While the Municipal Corporation of Delhi has notified that the schools run by the three corporations will remain closed during the period, the schools operated by the New Delhi Municipal Council will remain open.Wednesday turned out to be the coldest day this season as the maximum temperature plunged to 15.1 degrees Celsius, five notches below the normal.Noida and Ghaziabad had on Tuesday ordered closure of schools for two days in wake of the intense cold wave.The private school associations have expressed reservations about the order citing reasons that the academic progress at schools is likely to suffer since the schools had closed down for over 15 days earlier this month due to the odd-even experiment.
