Guns will be given to 1000 traffic officials in Delhi in view of rising instances of attacks on traffic personnel and for handling of emergencies in the national capital, Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi said on Monday.“Pistols will be given to 1000 traffic officials, especially the ones deployed at certain vulnerable zones, to deal with untoward incidents and emergencies. This is a move towards capacity-building and the arms are likely to be handed over to the officials by next month,” Mr. Bassi said at the Delhi Police’s Annual Conference.Senior Delhi Police officials said that cases of road rage and violence, in which the victims were traffic personnel, witnessed in the past two years prompted this decision.In October, a traffic police official suffered severe injuries after being hit by a speeding car in southeast Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin area.In September, a traffic constable sustained severe injuries after being hit by a speeding truck at a police picket near Delhi Cantonment area. The official was checking documents of heavy moving vehicles at a picket and the accused driver tried to escape for which he allegedly hit the driver and later fled after abandoning the vehicle.In July, two traffic constables were brutally thrashed by members of a family, who were later joined by a mob, when they stopped two minors riding a motorcycle, in northeast Delhi’s Gokulpuri area.In all cases, the officials were allegedly attacked by offenders, who wanted to escape and are suspected to be aware that traffic personnel are not armed. The aforementioned incidents, and many others, took place in late night or wee hours of the day, a senior official said.
