The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday directed German automobile major Volkswagen not to sell any diesel vehicle in India fitted with “cheat device” and give an undertaking in this regard.Cheat or defeat device is a software in diesel engines to manipulate emissions tests by changing the performance of the vehicles to improve results.A bench headed by Justice U D Salvi directed the company to give in writing that it would sell only those vehicles which comply with all emission norms as applicable.“We do see gravity of the matter. You should not sell cars with defeat device and which are not compliant. Let Volkswagen give an undertaking that it would not sell any vehicle in India fitted with ‘cheat device’,” the bench said.>Also read: All you need to know about the Volkswagen scandalThe Tribunal, which stopped short of directing ban on sale of Volkswagen vehicles in the country for allegedly flouting emission norms, also directed Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) to place its investigation report by February 4, the next date of hearing.Senior Advocate Pinaki Misra, appearing for Volkswagen, told the green panel that there were no such devices in its vehicles and ARAI was already investigating the matter and outcome is awaited.“The whole argument is based on the fact that something which happened in United States.
