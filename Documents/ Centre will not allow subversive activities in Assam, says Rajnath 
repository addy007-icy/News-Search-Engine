To prevent this, the government will take any type of action,” Singh said.“At the same time, if insurgents want to come to the mainstream, the government will always welcome them. But there will be no compromise on sovereignty, economic development and social status of India,” Singh, who is on a two-day visit to Assam, said.After visiting the international border along Bangladesh in Karimganj with Union Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, the Home Minister said the fencing of the remaining portion of the border will be completed by December 2015.Singh further said the riverine border will also be secured completely as illegal immigration takes place through the rivers in Assam.Besides, he said the Central government will initiate some special steps to develop the Barak Valley.Talking about road communication, Singh said the Central government is giving emphasis on development of road infrastructure in North East.“The Centre has sanctioned Rs 92,000 crore for developing this region’s road communication and the work is being carried out with high priority,” he added.
