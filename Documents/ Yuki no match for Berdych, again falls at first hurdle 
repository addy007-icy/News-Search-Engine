India’s Yuki Bhambri crashed out of the Australian Open men’s singles event after losing in straight sets to world number six Tomas Berdych in the opening round in Melbourne on Monday.Berdych kicked off his 50th consecutive Grand Slam in style, demolishing Yuki 7-5 6-1 6-2 in one hour and 45 minutes.Yuki started off well but his game deteriorated as the match progressed in fiercely hot conditions at the Margaret Court Arena.The Indian youngster proved no match for the sixth seed Berdych, who only dropped his service once in the opening set.Inexperience was writ large on Yuki’s game as Berdych broke the Indian’s serve six times.Last year’s semifinalist Berdych dropped his opening service game as Yuki was able to stick with his fancied opponent early on.However, in the end, Yuki failed to match the big-hitting Czech who dominated proceedings from 5-5.A double-fault that handed Berdych the first set in effect spelt the end for Yuki, who quickly fell apart as the Czech took complete control of the match, dictating the Indian’s serve with searching returns and firing down 13 aces against his opponent’s two.Berdych, who is in the same quarter of the draw as Roger Federer, hammered 35 winners and will next face Bosnia’s Mirza Basic.As for world no.95 Yuki, who appeared in the main draw of a singles event at the Grand Slam for the first time, it was the end of yet another frustrating first round campaign as last year too he lost his opener here in straight sets to Andy Murray.
