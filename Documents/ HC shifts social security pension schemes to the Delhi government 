Taking into account the poor financial health of municipal corporations in the city, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday transferred the social security pension schemes for the aged and disabled people to the Delhi government, asking the latter to review the ceiling on the number of beneficiaries.Disposing of a public interest writ petition moved by civil rights group Social Jurist, a Division Bench directed the three civic bodies to provide the government with the list of names and other details of people not receiving pension due to lack of funds.The Bench, comprising Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, asked the Delhi government to review its pension schemes for the aged and disabled people and explain why there was a ceiling on the number of beneficiaries.The Delhi government told the court that it was running two social security schemes for providing financial assistance to 4.3 lakh elderly people and 56,000 disabled people belonging to the economically weaker sections. Asking the government to re-examine the upper limit, the court said municipal bodies in the city were unable to pay assistance to the beneficiaries of their schemes due to lack of funds. Though the schemes had not been formally shut down, there were no beneficiaries for all practical purposes, it said.The East Delhi Municipal Corporation, meanwhile, told the court that though it had not discontinued the scheme, it could no longer pay the social security pensions due to lack of funds.In an affidavit filed in the court, the Delhi government said it was paying Rs.1,500 per month to people aged 70 years and above and Rs.1,000 per month to those aged between 60 and 69 years under the old age scheme.So far, an expenditure of Rs.456.96 crore had been incurred against the Budget allocation of Rs.600 crore under the old age assistance scheme, said the affidavit.
