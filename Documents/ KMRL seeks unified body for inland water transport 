All set to foray into the water transport sector by introducing 78 metro aqua boats in January 2017, the Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has demanded a unified water transport bill.“We must align and simplify Kerala’s regulatory system so that there is more clarity. All stakeholders in inland water transport must be brought under one umbrella. The Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Act (of 2010) must be amended so that there is more clarity on safety standards, and the methodology for safety inspections.“Enforcement too will have to be stepped up to ensure safer commuting,” said KMRL’s managing director Elias George.“We could help the State government in the process by readying a draft of the amendments needed,” he added.The State had welcomed a new set of rules readied by the KMRL for Kochi metro’s land acquisition, while provisions in the Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority (UMTA) Bill prepared by the metro agency were commended by the Union Urban Affairs Ministry.Mr. George demanded that fishing vessels be included in the purview of regulations, in view of incidents like the one at Fort Kochi in August last year, in which a carelessly-driven fishing vessel rammed a ferry, killing 11 passengers.There is a lot of confusion now since many agencies are venturing into the water transport sector.The Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) too plans a ferry service shortly in Kochi.There are clear norms for operation along the Kollam-Ernakulam-Kottapuram National Waterway III. “We need norms for other waterways too,” he said.Registering Authority for Boats under the Department of Ports K.R. Vinod said all stakeholders operating mechanised vessels in inland waterways must comply with the rules stated in the KIV Act. “Vessels operating in areas under Cochin Port Trust will automatically get the Trust’s licence if they have been certified as safe by us.“The government must take a call on including mechanised fishing vessels under the Act’s ambit. The remaining problems can be sorted out if the long-pending Kerala Maritime Board is constituted,” he said.
