A concrete one-foot median is getting ready at the intersection of Ormes Road, Dr. Alagappa Chetty Road, Barnaby Road, Flower’s Road and Millers Road in Purasawalkam. The median is expected to prevent motorists on the stretch from using other key stretches, which are one-way.At present, Dr. Alagappa Chetty Road is separated from other key stretches by a small triangular roundtana at the intersection. Corporation officials had placed small concrete slabs as median upto the roundtana from the road. However, motorists push the concrete blocks to use the one-way routes which results in accidents, especially on Ormes Road. Now, those temporary concrete blocks are being replaced with a concrete median stretching from Alagappar Chetty Road up to the intersection.“The small concrete median will prevent accidents. Earlier, motorists floated traffic rules by using the one-way stretches,” said a traffic policeman.A few traffic policemen were also deployed at the intersection to prevent motorists from using the one-way routes. However, due to lack of an adequate number of policemen, traffic policemen were hardly seen at the intersection.The intersection connects several neighbourhoods including Purasawalkam, Kellys, Kilpauk, Doveton, Anna Nagar, Perambur, Vepery and Ayanavaram with the rest of the city via Poonamallee High (PH) Road.“The permanent concrete median will also ensure the safety of pedestrians as many senior citizens live in the neighbourhoods around these stretches,” said K. Sugumar, a resident of Purasawalkam.
