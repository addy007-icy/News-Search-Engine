Chirag Gandhi’s heroic unbeaten maiden hundred went in vain as Gujarat narrowly missed out on what would have been a sensational victory over India-B in the Deodhar Trophy at Green Park here on Tuesday.Asked to bat first, India-B relied on Unmukt Chand’s half-century and Suryakumar Yadav and Stuart Binny’s fine contributions to post a challenging 280 for eight. It bowled out Gujarat for 273 to register a seven-run victory and make Friday’s final.Gujarat missed the services of its captain Parthiv Patel, who was laid low by illness. All-rounder Axar Patel will join the squad on Wednesday after his return from Australia.Notwithstanding its defeat, the Vijay Hazare Trophy champion gave India-B a tough fight.When Gandhi came in at 125 four in the 26th over, following a crucial 78-run stand between Manpreet Juneja (50) and Rujul Bhatt (45), the target was still a difficult one to achieve.After Bhatt’s departure, Gandhi stitched a 49-run (50 balls) partnership with Rush Kalaria. Binny ended the partnership by scalping Kalaria in the 39th over.Gandhi joined hands with Mehul Patel to add 36 runs. Even when Gujarat was reduced to 234 for nine, the gutsy right-hander hammered the India-B bowlers at will to single-handedly take his team to the brink of victory. In the final over, he made a wrong choice and helplessly watched his side lose the contest.With Gujarat needing 15 off six, Gandhi hit Suryakumar for a six over square-leg and then took a single to complete his century off 77 deliveries. No. 11 batsman Hardik Patel was run out off Shreyas Iyer’s throw while trying to give the strike back to Gandhi.In the morning, Unmukt scored his second consecutive half-century to help his team finish on 280.The scores:India-B: Unmukt Chand c Juneja b Shinde 63 (70b, 8x4), Mayank Agarwal c Panchal b Kalaria 0 (6b), Shreyas Iyer c Dhwanil b R.P.
