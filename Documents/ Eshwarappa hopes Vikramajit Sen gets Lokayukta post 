BJP Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council K.S. Eshwarappa has expressed the hope that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will recommend the name of Vikramajit Sen for the post of Lokayukta. In an informal chat with presspersons during his visit here on Tuesday, Mr. Eshwarappa said that at the consultative committee meeting in Bengaluru on Monday, held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, the name of Mr. Sen was proposed by the Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka, which was endorsed by D.H. Shankarmurthy, Chairman of the Legislative Council, Jagadish Shettar, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and himself, stating that Mr. Sen was a man of high integrity.“At that juncture, Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa suggested the name of S.R. Nayak, to which we expressed our reservation stating that several persons, including S.R. Hiremath of the Samaj Parivartan Samudaya, were opposed to his (Mr. Nayak’s) candidature and were issuing statements in the public against his name being proposed for the post. We have given our suggestions and it is left to the Chief Minister to take a decision. I still hope that the name of Mr. Sen will be recommended for the post,” he said.
