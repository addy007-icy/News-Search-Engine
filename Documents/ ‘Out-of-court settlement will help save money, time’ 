Though every individual wants to lead a happy life by strictly adhering to rules and regulations, at times, the situation forces them to take drastic steps and approach courts for justice. To save valuable time and money, people should prefer out-of-court settlement, District Principal and Sessions Judge and District Legal Services Authority Chairman S.B. Vastramath has said.Speaking after inaugurating a legal awareness programme organised by the District Legal Services Authority, the District Bar Association, the Zilla Panchayat and the District Health and Family Welfare Department here on Monday, he said that such programmes are being organised to create legal awareness among people as most of them have developed a tendency to approach courts for “silly matters”.Keeping this in view, the judiciary has introduced some simple methods where affected persons can get their problems solved in a short time and at affordable cost. People should make proper use of the facilities extended and lead a happy life, he added.He said that such programmes would be held in different places of the district in the next three days, he said.
