The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to defer hearing on the Uttar Pradesh’s plea, challenging the appointment of Lokayukta in the State due to the nonavailability of senior lawyer Kapil Sibal.A Bench led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi firmly said the State cannot be accommodated “beyond a point”.“Make another arrangement. We are listing it for tomorrow,” Justice Gogoi said.Adjournment soughtThe counsel for U.P. sought adjournment on the ground that Mr. Sibal, who has been leading it in the matter, is busy arguing before a five-judge Constitution Bench which is hearing a batch of petitions related to the Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly crisis.Extraordinary powers The case relates to the controversy behind the appointment of Virendra Singh, former judge of the Allahabad High Court, as the State's Lokayukta by the Supreme Court by using its extraordinary powers under the Constitution.Constitutional authority The court on December 16 last year had exercised its Constitutional authority and appointed Justice Singh as Lokayukta, saying the Constitutional functionaries — the Chief Minister, the Opposition Leader and Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court — had failed to comply with its orders by not appointing the chief of the state's anti-graft ombudsman.However, a fresh plea, which would be heard on Wednesday, was filed by journalist Sachchidanad Gupta highlighting several newspaper reports alleging that the Uttar Pradesh government had “concealed facts” about Justice Singh and “played fraud” on the apex court.
