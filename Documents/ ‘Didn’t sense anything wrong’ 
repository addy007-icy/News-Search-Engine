One of the last people Pawan Kumar spoke to was his childhood friend, Karan. The conversation happened over WhatsApp where, like they did at least once a week, the duo planned to go to their favourite joint in Rajinder Nagar. Karan, a BBA student, said Kumar himself pitched the idea and asked if he would join. “From the brief conversation we had on Saturday evening, I did not get the impression that there was something wrong,” said Karan. He added that he had spoken to Kumar a few days ago, but did not sense anything wrong. “As a matter of fact, being school friends we have known each other practically all our lives, but I cannot recall a single instance where he would have shared that his father’s business was facing problems or there was something unusual in his life. I still cannot believe he is dead,” said Karan about his friend, who was a third year mechanical engineering student.Kumar and his parents, Sanjay and Jyoti, were found dead at their Rajinder Nagar residence on Sunday.
