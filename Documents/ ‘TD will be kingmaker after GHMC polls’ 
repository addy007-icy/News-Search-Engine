Telugu Desam Party general secretary and party president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s son Nara Lokesh exuded confidence that the TDP would emerge as the kingmaker once the results to the forthcoming election to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation are declared.Mr. Lokesh asserted that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti had limited presence in the GHMC limits compared to the TDP which had a strong cadre base.Clarification sought“The TRS leadership should clarify as to why it is luring the leaders and candidates from the Telugu Desam Party if it is confident of its strength in the GHMC jurisdiction,” he said.Mr. Lokesh, who addressed the party’s nominees for the forthcoming elections, questioned as to why the people should vote for the TRS when the ruling party had done nothing for the development of the twin cities.There was absence of minimum facilities and basic infrastructure like proper roads in the cities ever since the TRS took over the reins. “Why should the people vote for the TRS when the party has done precious little to improve the city?” he asked.He pooh-poohed the claims of the TRS on the development of the city and said TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao had deputed his son and Minister K.T. Rama Rao for his party’s campaign, as the people did not believe his assurances.The Telugu Desam general secretary was apparently irritated when some of the contestants expressed concern over their prospects as the Telugu Desam’s ally BJP had fielded its nominees in some divisions.He said the TDP would contest on its own strength in these divisions and sounded confident that the party would emerge with flying colours post elections.Transparent mannerHe said the Telugu Desam leadership had allotted tickets to the contestants in a transparent manner after thorough scrutiny of the credentials of the aspirants.It was now upto the contestants to reach out the electorate effectively and ensure that the votes were cast in favour of the Telugu Desam.Mr. Lokesh assured that he would campaign for the TDP’s nominees for the next few days and this would be followed by road shows by the TDP president after January 26.
