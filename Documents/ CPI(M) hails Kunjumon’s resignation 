Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] district secretary K.N. Balagopal has welcomed the decision of Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) leader Kovoor Kunjumon to join hands with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) after resigning as MLA from Kunnathoor.In a statement here on Thursday, Mr. Balagopal said that during the last election to the Lok Sabha, the RSP had walked over to the United Democratic Front (UDF) camp by betraying the LDF.But large sections within that party had been simmering with rage against the decision of the RSP State leadership.The resignation of Mr. Kunjumon was a reflection of that rage and an indication of the shape of things to emerge in that party soon. The UDF which was neck deep in corruption found itself in a pathetic condition after being constantly criticised by courts.People who were progressive in their outlook and taking a strong stand against corruption would in no way feel comfortable with the UDF, Mr. Balagopal said. The UDF was getting more and more isolated from the people.
