Revathi may have walked out of Mysuru central jail along with her nine-month-old child with a smile on her face.But she was far from happy. For, her husband Amburaj, who has spent about 18 years in jail, will remain incarcerated.Revathi, who met Amburaj while performing in a play in Bengaluru, had married him when they were both out on parole.People’s Legal Forum convenor Baburaj said Amburaj’s release on good conduct had been shot down by the State government as he was serving term for having connections with forest bandit Veerappan.“I will meet Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and request him to consider Amburaj’s case on grounds of compassion,” said Revathi.Speaking to The Hindu from Amburaj’s native Puthukad in Erode, Revathi said her husband’s aged parents were also looking forward to Amburaj’s release, but were happy to see their grandchild.Baburaj said Revathi was a victim of trafficking. After she was shifted from Chennai to Bengaluru for domestic work, she resisted being trafficked to Mumbai.After she was hit by her tormentor, she retaliated, which led to the death of a woman.“But she was only 16 when she was arrested. Though the Juvenile Justice Act bars police from arresting girls under the age of 18, we did not have documents to prove her age,” he said.
