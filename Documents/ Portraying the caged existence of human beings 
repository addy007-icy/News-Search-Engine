Nothing scares people out of their wits as thoughts of self-alienation.Ironically, though, this is what people in contemporary society eventually end up embracing in someway or the other, so seems to say the ongoing art show, ‘Cage of Poignant Evolution’ comprising paintings of Ameen Khaleel, at Durbar Hall Art Centre in the city.Khaleel, who shot into prominence through his short stories, problematises the polemics of identity in a world characterised by compartmentalisations of numerous variety.Divided on account of caste, colour, gender, politics and ethnicity, people shun their fundamental identity as human beings, embarking, instead, on a journey away themselves in their quest for power, fame and money.“It’s a kind of self-imprisonment that we all do, without really being aware of it,” says Khaleel, native of Alappuzha who quit overseas employment to pursue art at artists’ village Cholamandalam.Acutely aware as he’s of this caged existence of human beings, his paintings present them alongside animals and birds in bid to also weave into the narrative the uncertainty over their status in the scheme of things. The viewer is at a loss to distinguish if it’s the creatures or human beings inside the cage.The show, the first in a series of 30 shows of young artists by the Lalithakala Akademi, will be open at Gallery-D between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. till January 15.
