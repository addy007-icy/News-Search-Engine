Relations between India and France have traditionally been cordial with both countries leveraging bilateral cooperation and exchanges in strategic areas ( >Editorial, Jan.27). In August 1962, when the French establishments in India became de jure part of the Union of India through a treaty of cession signed between India and France, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru affirmed keeping Pondicherry a “centre of French culture and French language” and said: “Our interest, is that, along with several centres of Anglo-Saxon culture, other Western cultures should also remain in India; this will help our fellow Indians to grow in an international milieu without having to go into exile at the other end of the world.” It is imperative that Prime Minister Narendra Modi carry forward this legacy. India should look towards building more bridges with European nations, and France in particular. French President François Hollande’s visit to India should not be evaluated merely within the parameters of the Rafale deal. Instead, the several agreements and MoUs signed between the two great countries should provide an opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties especially in the spheres of culture, trade and commerce.Shreyans Jain,New Delhi
