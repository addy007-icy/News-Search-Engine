Despite drastic reduction in devolution of funds from the State government for two years, the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat was able to perform well up to people’s expectations, said outgoing president and vice-president of the panchayat Asha Thimmappa Gowda and Satish Kumpala.Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Ms. Gowda listed out the achievements of the panchayat, which included construction of a village auditorium in Ayyanakatte, Kalanja village panchayat, Sullia taluk; residential layout to the victims of Tottilaguri landslide near Moodabidri; construction of over 18,000 houses under Indira Avaas and Basava Vasati projects; construction of official quarters for the CEO at a cost of Rs. 1.5 crore near ZP headquarters, maintenance of ZP roads at a cost of Rs. 71 crore; permanent drinking water projects in several villages at Rs. 18.3 crore and many more.Mr. Kumpala said that they could not ensure completion of Kinnigoli multi-village drinking water project which has been mired in controversies since its beginning.“The project had already started when we assumed office. Despite the panchayat recommending blacklisting of the contractor and the government accepting it, some influential Minister ensured it did not happen. It is highly doubtful now that the project will be completed,” he said.Similarly, the State government did not approve 15 of the 21 multi-village drinking water projects recommended by the panchayat so far. The devolution of funds from the government for drinking water projects too drastically came down, Mr. Kumpala regretted.
