The fate and future of Medak district – represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao – would change for the better with the newly proposed highways.Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has announced as many as 12 highways for Telangana State, and three of them would pass through Medak district.Balanagar – Bhaimsa, Nizampet – Bidar, and Sircilla – Siddipet – Jangam – Suryapet highway would pass through the district.According to sources, the Union government has accorded permission from Balanagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad to Bhaimsa in Adilabad district as National Highway number 61, and it would be expanded as a four-lane road. This would reduce the turnings in Gummadiala, Narsapur, Kowdipally, Kolcharam and Medak, thereby reducing accidents.The second one will be from Nizampet to Bidar for about 50 kilometres. With the national highway status, the time to travel to Bidar would get reduced, which will be beneficial for the people in Jogipet and Narayankhed constituenciesAll in the familyThe third highway from Sircilla to Suryapet via Siddipet and Jangam would touch three constituencies being represented by one family – Sircilla (Panchayat Raj Minister K. Taraka Rama Rao), Siddipet (Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao) and Gajwel (K. Chandrasekhar Rao).
