Thousands of people witnessed the ‘Jyothi Darshan’ (worshipping the light) at Sathya Gnana Sabha (Hall of True Knowledge), founded by Ramalinga Adigalar, popularly known as ‘Vallalar,’ at Vadalur on the occasion of Thai Poosam festival on Sunday.Since Saturday evening, thousands of devotees across Tamil Nadu and Union Territory thronged the Sathya Gnana Sabha. Special bus services were operated for the people who came from far-flung areas. Police and district authorities made elaborate arrangements to regulate the crowd and traffic.However traffic went out of gear as more and more vehicles brought devotees on the road to the Sabha even as steady stream of people were walking on both sides of the roads. The Jyothi Darshan is considered a special event by the followers of the Samarasa Sutha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam. The saint (Valallar) established the octagonal Hall of Knowledge (Sathiya Gnana Sabhai) to show people that God is in the form of Pure Grace and Light.He called the Sacred Hall of True Knowledge the manifestation of nature. What is to be experienced within one’s self has been shown externally in the Hall of True Knowledge.According to him, the light of the soul is Gnana Sabhai and the ever shining light of the soul is God. He aimed at making people realise this truth by showing Jyothi Darshan. On this day, the seven different curtains in the Sabha would be removed one after another to reveal the holy lighted lamp kept in the sanctum sanctorum.Serving of free meal from the very kitchen where Vallalar lit the ever burning stove for preparing and serving food to the people who suffer due to hunger is a tradition.In places surrounding the Sabha, free meals were distributed to the steady stream of devotees by philanthropic organisations, commercial establishments and political parties.A large number of devotees were seen generously donating to Sathya Dharma Salai (The Shrine of Truth and Charity) in the form of money, grains, rice and vegetables. Members who are associated with various sabhas sang Thiru Arutpa, a collection of poems written by Vallalar.
