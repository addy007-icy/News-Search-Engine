Until five years ago, Nathamedu, near Avadi, was unknown to the outside world, except for its large tracts of farmland irrigated by a small lake. And then L. Kalaivanan, an ardent fan of M.G. Ramachandran, built a temple in memory of the leader-actor.“Many of his fans, in their 50s and 60s, from various parts of the State visit the temple at least on his birth anniversary,” said 57-year-old Kalaivanan, who is working as a newspaper sub-agent in the neighbourhood for decades.As MGR’s 99{+t}{+h}birth anniversary is being observed today, the temple wears a festive look. .A community kitchen for the entire village and for fans, who come from various parts of the State, have been arranged.Ardent MGR fans from Kerala, Karnataka and also from the island nation of Sri Lanka, are also expected to visit the temple on Sunday, says Kalaivanan.
