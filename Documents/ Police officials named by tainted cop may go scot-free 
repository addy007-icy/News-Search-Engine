The police officials of different ranks, who were named by suspended policeman Mohan Reddy in a case of illegal financial deals, are not likely to face any departmental action.Mohan Reddy, an Assistant Sub-Inspector accused of driving a private school owner Prasada Rao to suicide a couple of months ago, confessed to the investigators that some police officials from the rank of Inspector to Additional SP were also involved in his financial deals. All the police officials named by the ASI were transferred and attached to the SP and DIG concerned soon after the ASI’s confessional statement came to light.Initially, Rao’s suicide case was investigated by the Karimnagar One-Town police, which arrested the ASI. As scores of others came forward to lodge complaints against him after his arrest, the government handed over the case to Crime Investigation Department (CID) billed as the State’s premier agency in decoding complex cases.“The ASI stated that some police officers had given him money to invest in finance business. But, there should be documentary evidence to substantiate his charge,” said a CID official associated with the investigation of the case.Meanwhile, three police officers who were transferred for being named in the Mohan Reddy case, were given new postings.
