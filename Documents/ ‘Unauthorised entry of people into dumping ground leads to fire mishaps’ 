For the residents of Kannadapalayam in Tambaram, Thursday’s fire in a dumping ground maintained by the Tambaram municipality there was hardly surprising.In July 2015, a similar fire broke out in the dumping ground and it lasted for more than a week. Unauthorised entry of people into the dumping ground is said to be the reason for such accidents.Regional Director of Municipal Administration, N.S. Prema, told The Hindu that the municipality had been constructing a compound wall on one side of the dumping ground and a compound wall would be constructed at a cost of Rs. 18 lakh on the rear side to prevent unauthorised entry. The concessionaire for the waste-to-energy centre at Venkatamangalam would undertake the work on ‘scientific closure of this site’ and the one at Ganapathipuram in Pallavaram municipality soon, which would put an end to these mishaps, she said.A wall will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 18 lakh on the rear side of the dumping yard
