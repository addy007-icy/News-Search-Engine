Two members of a family with ties to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) were killed in an explosion at Khairasole in West Bengal‘s Birbhum district.The deceased are Sheikh Hafizul and Tariq Hussain, brothers of Sheikh Jabir Hussain, a local panchayat member from the TMC.“The blast was caused by crude bombs. Either they were stored in the house or crude bombs were being made there,” District Superintendent of Police Mukesh Kumar told The Hindu on Friday.The blast occurred inside the cow shed of the house and the roof of the shed was blown away by the impact of the explosion.When asked about the incident, Trinamool Congress leader and Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said law would take its own course.The Bharatiya Janata Party used the opportunity to target the TMC government alleging that during its regime the State had become a “safe haven for criminals.”Over the past few years, several incidents of people losing their lives in crude bomb explosions have been reported from the rural areas of south Bengal.
