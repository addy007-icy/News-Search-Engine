Scores of students affiliated to various unions took out a rally and forced suspension of classes on the Kakatiya University campus here on Monday protesting over a dalit student’s suicide in the University of Hyderabad. Students led by Jorika Ramesh, B Prashant, K Rajender and others led the rally that ended at the SDLCE crossroads where they staged a rasta roko on the main thoroughfare and burnt the ‘effigy’ of the Central Government.Mr. Ramesh accused the authorities of the University of Hyderabad of discriminating against dalit students and held them responsible for all suicides of dalit students on the campus. He also found fault with Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya for supporting a section of students on the campus and forcing authorities to act against the dalit students. The students demanded that the authorities revoke suspension on four other students and take action against those responsible for Rohit’s death.
