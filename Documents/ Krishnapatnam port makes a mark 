The Krishnapatnam port, which is seen as a hub for heavy capesize ships, achieved a distinction once again with the berthing of cape vessel MV Percival on Friday.Capesize ships are the largest dry cargo ships. They are too big to transit the Suez Canal or Panama Canal. Such ships have to pass either through the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn to cross oceans.The heavy vessel was carrying 1,57,000 MMT of coal from as far as South Africa. It was safely berthed.Port officials said: “With this, the port started servicing capes again, which demonstrates the infrastructural prowess of the port to assure continued and seamless business experience for users.”The port suffered floods during November 2015, which caused siltation and adversely impacted port operations.However, equipped with its in-house dredgers and trained staff, the port achieved the draft of 18 metres in a span of 50 days after the floods.As of now, it is one of the few in the country that has the strength to handle capesize vessels with 2,00,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT).Krishnapatnam Port CEO Anil Yendluri congratulated the dredging team for their untiring efforts in bringing the port back to normal and helping it set a new benchmark.Capesize vessel MV Percival safely berthed at the port
