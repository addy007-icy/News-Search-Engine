Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president E.V.K.S. Elangovan on Friday said the State government was not concerned about people dying due to alcoholism.Addressing a public meeting in Ranipet, he criticised Minister for Prohibition Natham R. Viswanathan’s statement in the Assembly that total prohibition was “impossible” as the revenue will decrease.Urging people to utilise the Assembly elections for their own good, he said, “Cast your vote to remove an anti-people government. It is your duty to vote for a secular party to ensure that the unity among Hindus, Muslims and Christians is not affected in the future.”Mr. Elangovan said there was large-scale corruption in the State, and alleged that people have to pay bribe to get ration cards and government jobs, and even to become vice chancellors of universities.
