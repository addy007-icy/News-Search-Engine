“God created all living and non-living things to coexist in a rhythm and equilibrium, which we often call as ecological balance. Ecological disasters befall us when this balance is lost,” Bishop Thomas K. Oommen, Deputy Moderator of the Church of South India, has said.The bishop was delivering the presidential address at the national seminar on climate change, organised by the CSI Department of Ecological Concerns, at the Eco Spirituality Centre at Othera near Thiruvalla on Thursday.He said the Church would join hands with local and international bodies in protecting nature.The Bishop said India was a land of many religions and Hinduism was its major religion. Hinduism believed that the earth could be seen as a manifestation of the goddess and must be treated with respect. The five elements of space, air, fire, water, and earth were the foundation of an interconnected web of life and Hinduism taught us about ‘dharma’ (duty) and our responsibility to give due care to the earth, he said. In fact, the simple living practised by the sages was a model for the development of sustainable economies.The bishop said more than 5,000 verses in the Koran exhorted the believers to reflect on nature, to study the relationship between living organisms and their environment, and to make the best use of reason to maintain their balance.“I am convinced that Christianity and the Bible clearly elucidate the role of humans in leading a symbiotic life,” he said. The bishop said all religions taught us to conserve nature, for it was God’s gift to us. Christians should engage in this mission, not just out of social commitment, but out of spiritual thrust.Rev. D.R. Sadananda, CSI general secretary, inaugurated the seminar. Chandra Bhushan, director of Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, delivered the keynote address.
