Located in Indiranagar, The Big Kahuna is a venture of the J.S.M. Corporation. The name of the restaurant evokes curiosity. Once you enter, you see lots of Tiki plants (the tiny plants are found in Hawaii), masks and totem poles for that complete Hawaiian feel.The ambience is low key; it could’ve been more creative. The food, however, makes up for it. With its wide range of drinks with quirky names and small bites to go along with them, you can sit back and relish everything the place has to offer for the vegetarians and the non vegetarians.In the appetizers, the lomi lomi bruschetta, Jalapeno cheese balls, TBK (The Big Kahuna) crispy chicken with peri peri marinade and chipotle hummus sauce are something to die for. The Jalapeno cheese balls, with their rich cheesy taste along with a sour and spicy taste, literally settle all over your mouth and the cheesy taste lingers on for a while, making you go into a state of trance. For the main course it was fusilli with jalapeno and sour cream with chicken and Jamaican jerk chicken. The fusilli, giving a sour yet spicy tinge to the dish, simply melts in your mouth. The dishes have an amazing balance of flavour and leave you wanting more.Finally, though you’ve eaten to your heart’s content, one should never say no to the desserts. The coffee crème brulee was a complete treat which confirms the phrase – the dessert always goes into the heart.With its lip-smacking food and drinks, and chic playlist, we say The Big Kahuna is a dream come true for all foodies out there.
