Even as Nestle claimed that tests showed Maggi noodles to be safe and that it had now become an “ego problem” for the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the Supreme Court on Wednesday remained cautious and asked a government laboratory at Mysore to further clarify that the lead and glutamic acid content in the popular two-minute noodles is within permissible parameters.Taking a neutral stand, the Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra said its caution stems from the concern that the noodles brand is the favourite food of the young generation.The Bench perused two test reports on the Maggi samples, but sought more clarity after the government and food regulatory authorities claimed the findings were not conclusive.“We would like the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru, to apprise this court on two aspects: whether the test report relating to lead and glutamic acid are within the permissible parameters and if these are within the parameters prescribed under the Food Safety Act,” Justice Misra observed.The Bench refused to pass any interim orders. It posted the hearing for April 15.The court gave the laboratory liberty to collect fresh samples of the noodles from the stock available in Lucknow in the presence of a court commissioner and lawyers of both the FSSAI and Nestle.
