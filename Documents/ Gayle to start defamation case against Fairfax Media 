Under-fire Chris Gayle has sought the services of a leading Australian lawyer to start defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media over allegations that the West Indian cricketer indecently exposed himself to a woman in Sydney during the World Cup last year.The allegations came to the fore following Gayle’s widely-criticised live interview with Ten Sports’ female presenter Mel McLaughlin while playing for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League.The Renegades slapped a fine of $10,000 for making controversial remarks to McLaughlin, who found herself being asked out for a drink after Gayle blasted 41 runs off 15 balls on Monday.Gayle said he was happy to be interviewed “just to see your eyes for the first time”, before adding, “Don’t blush, baby”.“Chris Gayle has strongly denied allegations first published by Fairfax Media that he indecently exposed himself to a woman during last year’s World Cup in Sydney,” Gayle’s manager Simon Auteri said in a statement.“Despite such denials Fairfax Media continues to publish the false and defamatory allegations which have received widespread re-publication in media throughout the world.“As a result Chris Gayle has retained Mark O’Brien, a leading Australian media lawyer to immediately commence defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media.”The storm surrounding the star Jamaican cricketer intensified on Wednesday as new allegations about his behaviour towards women emerged. More female journalists aired complaints against the West Indian.Gayle apologised and tried to brush off the exchange with McLaughlin as a harmless joke, but Fox Sports reporter Neroli Meadows branded the Jamaican a “creep”.
