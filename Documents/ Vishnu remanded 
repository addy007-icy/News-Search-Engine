The prosecution is learnt to have insisted that the accused be sent to remand on grounds that some witnesses had faced intimidation and that a notice had been duly served earlier under Section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) seeking cooperation for investigation. It was on the basis of credible information about their culpability that the accused were arrested.Deputy Director of Prosecution B. Ramakoteswara Rao argued that an interim anticipatory bail application filed by the accused was not maintainable, as police had exercised their power under Section 41 (1) of the CrPC.
