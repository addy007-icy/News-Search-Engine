Concerned over a plea moved by a person belonging to the Scheduled Caste, alleging that his grandfather who died on Sunday could not be buried as the upper caste people in his village were preventing him from using the road leading to the burial ground, the Madras High Court directed Nagapattinam district administration and the police to act swiftly to resolve the issue.Passing the directions on a petition moved by M. Sankar whose 100-year-old grandfather died in Vazhuvur village on Sunday, Justice M.M. Sundresh said, “It is very unfortunate that equality eludes a person till death starting from his birth.”Malice in societyNoting that the deceased could not be given a decent burial due to malice prevalent in society, the judge said, “This court expects the authorities to act immediately to do the needful and report the same on Tuesday, failing which appropriate orders will be passed.”‘Can’t use common burial ground’The petitioner said that since the Scheduled Caste members were prevented from using the common burial ground, they were using a portion of the land on the bund of the tank from time immemorial. Since there was no proper road to access the burial ground, the Scheduled Caste members had to pass through the caste Hindu area, which often led to problems.
