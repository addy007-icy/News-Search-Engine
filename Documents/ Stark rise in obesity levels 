The latest round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2015–16) raises some concerns on changing lifestyles and its effect on the health of people.It shows, for instance, a stark rise in obesity levels among both men and women. The proportion of men who are obese has 10.9 per cent to 22.1 per cent when compared to the last round of NFHS (2005–06), and among women it has gone up from 15.3 per cent to 23.3 per cent.Equally stark is the difference in urban and rural population on this front. While 17.1 per cent of rural men are obese when compared to 28.6 per cent rural men, the difference between rural and urban women is 16.6 per cent and 31.8 per cent, as revealed by this NFHS.For the first time, the survey has also looked at lifestyle problems such as hypertension and diabetes.
