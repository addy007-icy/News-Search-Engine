To expand market for seafood from Mangaluru and Udupi, the State government has proposed to open hygienic retail outlet-cum-restaurants in the North Karnataka region during 2016-17, according to N.S. Channappa Gowda, Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.Speaking to media on the sidelines of a workshop on the “use of space technology in fisheries” here on Monday, he said that the government through the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC) has opened retail outlet-cum-canteens in district headquarters in the central and the southern districts of the State.But North Karnataka districts have not been covered. Such outlet-cum-canteens would serve hygiene seafood.At present, the KFDC has 17 outlets in central and southern districts of the State. Once all districts are covered, people could get hygienic seafood, and fishermen in the coastal belt could increase their income.V.K. Shetty, Managing Director, KFDC, said that the corporation would open 10 more hygienic fish markets in the State this and the next year.Each one of them would cost between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh and in each such market about 15 vendors could sell fish.These markets would be set up in Bidar, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Dharwad, Hubballi, Bellari, Belagavi and Gadag, among others.A proposal has been made to expand market for seafood from Mangaluru-Udupi
