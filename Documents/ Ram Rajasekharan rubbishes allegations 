In his first official reaction to the police complaint filed against him by a fellow scientist, CFTRI director Ram Rajasekharan said that “Chief scientist K.S.M.S. Raghava Rao was not given vigilance clearance due to doubtful integrity” and this was the reason for his launching a personal attack.“He [Dr. Rao] had joined hands with some elements, who have disturbed peace and harmony in the campus many times,” he said, while reacting to the complaint.“It is evident by his recent actions and fabricated allegations against me that he is desperately eyeing for the post of institute,” Prof. Rajasekharan said on Thursday.
