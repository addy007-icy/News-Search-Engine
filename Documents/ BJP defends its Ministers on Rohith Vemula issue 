The BJP on Tuesday rejected demands for the resignation of the Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya over the alleged suicide of a Dalit student at the University of Hyderabad, accusing the Congress of politicising the incident.BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao tweeted that the issue was not one of atrocities on Dalits.“Suicide of Rohith Vemula has nothing to do with Dalit issues or rights just because he was a Dalit.”“It is unfortunate that Rahul Gandhi is doing politics over suicide. Congress has stooped to such a low,” BJP secretary Shrikant Sharma said.
