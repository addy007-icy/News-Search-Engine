Maratha Tiger, a Marathi feature film, has sparked protests by Kannada organisations against its release in the border areas of the State, even as Additional Deputy Commissioner Suresh Itnal, on Friday, issued directions to the police authorities to take precautionary measures against possible untoward incidents due to release of the film in the district.Mr. Itnal has directed the Police Commissioner, the Superintendent of Police and the Sub-Divisional Magistrates of Belagavi and Chikkodi to take steps to ensure that the film did not lead to any untoward incidents in their respective jurisdictions.Both Mr. Itnal and Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee President Ashok Chandargi said that the film’s trailer clearly depicted “Yellur incidents” (in Belagavi taluk) of July 25, 2014, which issue was before the National Human Rights Commission following a complaint from a Maharashtra-based politician Vinod Tavade. The film also suggested that no reply was submitted to the NHRC notice. Mr. Chandargi said that as the Yellur incident was still before the NHRC and the border dispute was yet to be disposed of by the Supreme Court, the film should not be screened in the boundary areas of the State.
