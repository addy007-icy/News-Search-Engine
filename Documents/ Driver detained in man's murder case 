Venkateswarlu had stopped at the clinic, near his house, while returning home from his office in Anna Nagar.A senior police official said that though they were yet to identify the killers, there were reasons to believe that an office-related dispute led to the murder.Police said they were trying to find out if there were any conflicts within Kalpataru Power Transmission Limited, a Gujarat-based company in Chennai, while awarding contracts worth several crores of rupees. They were also exploring the possibility of an aggrieved ex-staff, who was expelled from the company, to have carried out the gruesome murder.Police also detained the victim’s driver Arumugam of Sankarankovil in Tirunelveli district for further questioning, as they believe he was among the few who knew of Venkateshwarlu’s daily routine.
