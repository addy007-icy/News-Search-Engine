Students of Chikkanna Government Arts College, who are staying in the SC/ST hostel on the college campus, along with Students Federation of India (SFI) activists, petitioned Collector G. Govindaraj highlighting the pathetic state of the hostel.The SFI district secretary, R. Vimal, said the toilets had been remaining unclean for long and hence, the students were forced to resort to open defecation.Similarly, the students were not getting protected drinking water and the hostel building is in a dilapidated condition, he added.Another issue highlighted by the students was the meagre allocation of funds for the meals to the students and the rooms were overcrowded.“Maintenance allowance given to the students staying in the hostel for carrying out hair cut, buying soaps and oil have not been given for the past many months”, accused Mr. Vimal.The students went back after the senior revenue officials assured to look into the issues on their merit.
