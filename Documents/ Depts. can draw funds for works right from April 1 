Government departments in Andhra Pradesh can draw their plan budgetary allocations for 2016-17 right from April 1 provided they include the respective blueprints for the projects and development works they propose to execute in the new financial year. With this objective in mind, the Finance Department has been involving all the departments to prepare their plan and non-plan expenditure proposals in all seriousness and justify the resources sought by them.The departments have to give their specific requirements along with action plan, indicating the resources required for each quarter and even month in their budgetary proposals itself. Thus the approved amount will be kept available right from April 1, the first day of the financial year. “This will facilitate the departments to execute the proposals approved under the plan expenditure straight away without wasting any time,” official sources said.It became more of a tradition for the government departments to give only indicative requirements rather than going into specific details. Action plans are prepared for capital expenditure only after the budget is approved in the Assembly.The result, at least first two quarters will go away with the departments finalising the proposals for development works and seeking administrative sanction after scrutiny. By the time procedure is completed and funds are released and works are grounded, the financial year would have come to an end. Yet the departments get away for the delay at their end with the excuse that the file was pending with the Finance Department.“This year we changed the system and the departments should do their due diligence before hand and come with specific fund requirement in their budgetary proposals itself,” sources said.The exercise has commenced about a month ago for non-plan expenditure first. Over 20,400 drawing and disbursing officers of every department right from mandal level to the State were asked to upload online details of expenditure towards salary of employees, including contract, outsourced etc., under them so that exact budgetary allocation can be made.“This will bring in accuracy and transparency and 90 per cent of the DDOs have already uploaded these details. Friday is the deadline for the rest to comply or face action,” sources said. For 2015-16, Finance Department released Rs.12,000 crore over and above the budget provision to some departments like irrigation as they failed to project them in their budget proposals. Such sanctions would upset the budget planning and expenditure will overshoot the revenue.The Finance Department will hold meetings with the department officials from Jan. 25 to Feb. 5 and from Feb. 10 onwards, Finance Secretary along with Finance Minister will hold meetings with department secretaries and finalise proposals subject to norms, availability of resources and priorities decided by the government.Departments have been told to give their specific requirements along with action plan
