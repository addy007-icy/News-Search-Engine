Breaking his silence on the suicide of Rohith Vemula, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he could feel the agony of the Dalit scholar’s family. Meanwhile, his speech at the 6th convocation of the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University here, was greeted with negative slogans by students who asked him to “go back.”“I am proud that India is a nation of the youth, its dreams and resolve are young.
