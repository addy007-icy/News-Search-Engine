With paint tins in one hand and brushes on the other, anyone would mistake them for the ubiquitous graffiti artists in Fort Kochi. But they were a group of policemen working hard to avoid conflict in a community.A collection of road graffiti that appeared in Fort Kochi on the New Year eve kept the city police on their toes for a couple of hours after objections were raised about a couple of inscriptions in the collection. The complainants told the policethat a couple of pictures in the collection depicted Hindu gods in an objectionable manner.The incident first came to the notice of the authorities when Fort Kochi sub-collector S. Suhas received a complaint in this regard from a section of local residents. The official then directed the police to remove the objectionable drawings.Soon, a police team rushed to the spot and effaced the pictures by pouring whitewash. It took the men in Khaki nearly a couple of hours to identify the pictures and complete the task.“The images were inscribed using white paint on the Kappangamukku-Moolamkuzhy road as part of the New Year celebrations. Preliminary investigations revealed that the graffiti was the handiwork of some local youths, who are yet to be identified,” said C. Binu, Sub-Inspector of Police, Thoppumpady.The police have already interrogated several people in this connection though no cases have been registered.“Preliminary investigations have confirmed that the pictures were part of decking up the street for the New Year celebrations.“Hence, no case has been registered,” said V.G. Raveendranath, Circle Inspector, Mattancherry.
