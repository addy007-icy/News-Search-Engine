While women welcome the mixies and grinders, many say the fans have been put to disuse. “The fan stopped working the day after I got it,” said a beneficiary from Pumping Station street in Chindadripet.“In almost all our homes, the fans stopped working in the first few weeks,” says a woman in a Otteri slum. Many beneficiaries echo the opinion. There are fewer complaints about the other two products.“The appliances are checked for quality before we distribute them. The fans could get damaged while their are being transported. We also provide contact numbers for service centres should they find any faults after using them”, said a civil supplies official.
