V. Santhanam was riding towards Tambaram Sanatorium on Grand Southern Trunk Road when a car coming in the opposite direction with its headlights beaming, dazzled his eyes, bringing him to an abrupt halt.Not just the bright headlights, but also the poor illumination on the stretch had caused the problem.This incident happened near Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram Sanatorium and a pedestrian was crossing the road. Luckily, Santhanam applied the brakes of his motorcycle in the nick of time.Sections of Grand Southern Trunk Road, especially those near Tambaram Sanatorium and the Madras Institute of Technology Flyover, have become a nightmare for vehicle-users with many of the streetlights not functioning. To make matters worse, vehicles come at high speed.The pedestrians’ pathway on the flyover is also plunged in darkness. Every day, on an average, lakhs of vehicles pass through GST Road which is the southern gateway to Chennai.The MIT Flyover provides connectivity to Hasthinapuram and Chitlapakkam.“Apart from the non-functioning lights, the cold breeze and sometimes fog also trouble road-users at night. Dense fog and a poorly-illuminated stretch are a deadly combination,” Santhanam, a resident of Chromepet, said.At night, the Highway sees a huge volume of heavy vehicles. Given the speed at which they are driven, the possibility of fatal accidents is always high.The State Highways Department should take steps to provide proper illumination on these sections to ensure safety, road users said.
