Communication of a message through a visual work of art is more impactful when compared to other mediums. Keeping this in mind Safeducate, an educational institute has partnered with Publica, an initiative for promotion of art, to organise an event wherein artist Bhuwal Prasad is painting an old truck container to spread awareness about environment conservation.Placed at Select Citywalk mall in Saket, this emerging piece of art will help make the visitors and onlookers discuss the degradation of nature and environment. “We are trying to send out this important social message through the channel of art,” comments Bhuwal. The artist observes that considering the adverse effect of the increasing pollution levels and felling of tree more such initiatives should be launched.Bhuwal whose works were exhibited at the 6th Beijing Biennale, plans to paint the container with street art patterns which will be vivid and in green keeping with the theme of the event ‘go green’ –– thus helping to portray depleting greenery and natural beauty. In order to make it more meaningful the interiors of the container will be covered with wall paper containing messages and ideas on how to go green.The painting of the container, to be completed by February 7, will be placed for public viewing till the end of the month.Thereafter it is planned to be moved around to different parts of the country as part of a campaign to galvanise public support for environmental conservation.Divya Jain, the founder of CEO, Safeducate informs that old truck containers which are discarded after 10 to 15 years can be recycled by turning them in art pieces. “Art should not be something you look at and leave. I feel it should be something you internalise and add in your lives,” she comments.Many such containers are utilised to impart various vocational training courses in villages across the country.
