Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Khaleda Zia on Tuesday demanded fresh national elections under a non-partisan government, alleging that the government is staying in power “illegally”.She termed the Sheikh Hasina government and the present Parliament “illegal”, and claimed that all activities carried out by the government are “illegal too”.Addressing a rally marking the second anniversary of the parliamentary election, one the BNP terms the “death of democracy day”, the former prime minister also demanded dialogue with the government “for the sake of democracy”.The BNP and its allies, including Jamaat-e-Islami, had carried out violent agitations in 2015 to mark the first anniversary of the polls. They had demanded a rerun of the election under a caretaker government.She alleged that the ruling Awami League is trying to establish “monarchy” or initiate “one-party rule”, warning the government of consequences.Government confidentA confident Awami League celebrated the second anniversary of the last national election as the ‘Victory of Democracy Day’.It has stepped up its campaign to isolate the BNP for its ‘mindless violence’ and its links to Jamaat-e-Islami. A determination on the part of the ruling party to go ahead with war crimes trials seems to have helped it gain popularity.Analysts also say Ms. Zia’s recent comments casting aspersions on the martyr’s figure has caused her party further problems. On the other side, the government’s tough action against two Pakistani diplomats facing charges of terror financing has boosted it’s image, analysts say.
