For those using coloured umbrellas as a shield from the sun, think again. Two class 7 students have demonstrated that coloured umbrellas do not act as shield from the sunâ€™s ultraviolet (UV) rays and black was the best.Sharing space with technology demonstrators from the industry at the Pride of India exhibition are Tarun Ashok and G. Yugandhar from Sishu Griha Montessori and High School, Bengaluru.They conducted a comparative study of the UV rays shielding character of different coloured umbrella fabrics and found that black was the best. The coloured, though popular, allowed UV rays to pass through. This was part of a project the two students took up and was selected by the Visvesvaraya Museum, Bengaluru, for display, while the Department of Science and Technology selected this project for demonstration at the Pride of India science exhibition, according to their project guide Suryanarayan Rao.The two students have also found better uses of x-ray film that are discarded. They can be used in hats to shield field workers from UV rays as they found that these films provided better protection. These and many other innovations by children have found a place at the exhibition being held as part of the Indian Science Congress in University of Mysore.
