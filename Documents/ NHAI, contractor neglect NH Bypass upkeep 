Motorists and pedestrians along Edapally-Aroor NH 47 Bypass are having a harrowing time, since neither NHAI nor the contractor entrusted with the repair and upkeep of the corridor are doing enough to streamline traffic flow and prevent accidents.The National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) Chairman Raghav Chandra had recently ordered all its regional offices to make highways safe and pothole-free, for which it empowered regional officers to immediately award works up to Rs 1 crore. The anticipatory-bail pleas of NHAI officials and that of a toll-collecting firm were recently rejected after police charged them with negligence following an accident in Thrissur that claimed the life of seven passengers of an MUV. The vehicle plunged into a water body abutting the NH at an accident-prone area that did not have lighting and barricades.The NHAI had entrusted a firm named Kochi-Aroor Tollways Private Limited with the task of operation, maintenance and tolling (OMT) of the 16-km-long Edappally-Aroor corridor five months ago. The firm is contractually bound to maintain the stretch in safe and motorable condition for a nine-year period up to 2024 since it is collecting sizeable toll from motorists.Motorists at riskNHAI officials said the firm has not begun even urgent works like repairing potholes on the bypass.Neither has steps been taken to restore earthen road shoulders of service roads that were washed away in the rain. Subsequently, motorists end up in accidents, while pedestrians have to risk their life while walking along service roads. Encroachers too have not been evicted. Drains that overflow during rains and subsequently cause flooding on the bypass and service roads are another problem, they said.Judge’s concernReacting to the safety hazards due to slack maintenance and traffic snarls along the NH Bypass corridor, former Judge of Kerala High Court T.K. Chandrasekhara Das who was appointed by State government to probe and suggest remedies to prevent road accidents said that upkeep of toll highways has become a vicious circle, with stakeholders often shirking responsibility. Funds often end up in wrong hands under different heads, including consultancy, he said.
