Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises G.M. Siddeshwar has said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not against Muslims. In fact, the party had taken several steps for the welfare of minority communities during its rule in the State as well as during the present reign at the Centre.Speaking after inaugurating a BJP minorities wing convention here on Wednesday, he alleged that since several decades, the Congress has used the minority community as its vote bank and had failed to take any steps for their welfare. The Congress government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, in the State is also following the same strategy of using the minority community as vote bank, he said.There has always been a sense of brotherhood among Hindus and Muslims in the country and it is because of some vested interests that communal clashes take place as they [vested interests] want to fulfil their personal and political agenda by creating such tension.“During the last Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leaders tried to misguide the people by issuing statements that the BJP would force Muslims to leave the country if it comes to power, but the people of the nation supported the party wholeheartedly and brought it to power,” he added.If Prime Minister Narendra Modi was against Muslims, he would not have given opportunity to two Muslim leaders to become Ministers in his Cabinet and he would not have visited Pakistan to extend the hand of friendship to that country.The Union government has also launched several schemes for the welfare of Muslims and it is the responsibility of the authorities concerned to ensure that the benefits reached all eligible beneficiaries, he said. The party’s State Minorities Wing in-charge Jagadish Hiremani alleged that the Congress has not made any sincere efforts to solve the problems of minority communities in the last six decades and has always misguided them only to remain in power.But now things are gradually changing and the minority community people have come to know about the misdeeds of the Congress, he said.BJP district president T.G. Narendranath, State unit vice-president Shamir Alam Khan, general secretary Shant Kumar and Maqsood Pasha were present.
