Minister for Mines, Peethala Sujatha on Sunday accused the YSR Congress of indulging in false propaganda on Janmabhoomi as that party was unable to digest the fact that the programme was receiving a huge response from the people.Condemning the “venomous propaganda” by YSRC to mislead the people, she said the Opposition should realise that the government disposed 95 per cent of the representations received in the previous two phases of Janmabhoomi. She said problems relating to 33,36,557 representations of the total 34,87,546 received during the first two phases have been solved.She said in case of any issues, the Opposition party should give constructive suggestions instead finding fault.She said the criticism of the committee constituted by the Speaker to examine the suspension of YSR Congress member, R K Roja showed the bankruptcy of the Opposition party.
