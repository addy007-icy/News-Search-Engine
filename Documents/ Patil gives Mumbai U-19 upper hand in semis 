When stumps were drawn at the Sardar Patel Stadium, Gujarat were 57 for three.Mumbai coach Vinod Raghavan praised Patil for his priceless contribution, especially with Armaan Jaffer busy with India Under-19 duties. “Sairaj has been doing a fantastic job in the lower middle order. We started the day on 324 for six. Skipper Shams Mulani (80, 158b, 10x4, 1x6) was on 76 and Sairaj on 56. Shams fell early and Sairaj just shifted gears. He batted very well with the tail,” a satisfied Raghavan told The Hindu from Valsad.Patil represents the iconic Dadar Union Club. “He is from Boisar, and joined the famous club only recently. The Mumbai Under-19 team benefits not just from his fearless hitting but also from his effective bowling. He is a very good medium pacer.Rank turnerIn the other semifinal, Uttar Pradesh defeated Baroda four minutes before lunch in the second day at the Motibagh Ground, Baroda.
