The distribution of LED bulbs under Hosa Belaku, the Energy Department’s flagship programme, has been expanded with eco-friendly bulbs available at 52 places across five districts under the jurisdiction of Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC).Over three lakh bulbs have been sold in a span of one month, after the programme was launched in Mysuru in December last.The authorities claim that the distribution of bulbs, each costing Rs. 100, was going smoothly, with no hiccups in distribution.CESC General Manager (Technical) Raghu Prakash told The Hindu that the response for the scheme had picked up pace and more consumers had been buying the bulbs.The CESC had been set a three-year target to sell 67 lakh bulbs in Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and Kodagu districts. “If we go at this pace, we may reach the target much earlier,” he felt.The project, under the Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP), was launched here on December 11 and sales began on December 14.The Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), an entity of the Union government, started distributing 9 Watt bulbs at a subsidised cost of Rs. 100 per bulb.EESL has procured bulbs from a private manufacturer through a tender. At present, a maximum of five bulbs is distributed after the consumer provides supporting documents.The CESC was among the first to start distributing bulbs under the scheme, since the State-wide project took off in Mysuru.The distribution of bulbs was first launched only at 11 CESC sub-divisions, including nine in Mysuru city and one each in T. Narsipur and Nanjangud, but sales have now been extended to 52 places, including district headquarters.Mr. Prakash said the EMI option of buying the LED bulbs (the amount will be deducted in the monthly electricity bill) may take some more time to become a reality since a tripartite agreement is still to be signed. Once the agreement is done, CESC will be the one who has to collect money from the consumer.“If the option comes into effect, sales will go up further, including in rural areas,” he replied.Full stockLED bulbs have been kept in adequate stocks so that no consumer is turned away citing non-availability.“As of today, there is a stock of 10 lakh bulbs with the supplier which may last for several weeks. Any number of bulbs can be procured in case the stock exhausts,” said CESC General Manager (Technical) Raghu Prakash.
