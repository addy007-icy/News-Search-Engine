Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is very keen to provide a good public transport system from the city to the pilgrim centre of Yadagirigutta, hence the Government is mulling several options like providing a landrail link to begin with.This was stated by Hyderabad Metro Rail managing director N.V.S.Reddy at the hill shrine when he visited the place here on Wednesday. “We are studying several long term and short term options. Since MMTS phase two will be linked upto Ghatkesar, it will be another 32 km to link to Rayagiri station,” he explained.
