The Aam Aadmi Party government will review its odd-even vehicle rationing scheme next week to decide if it needs to resort to the anti-pollution measure in the future, Transport Minister Gopal Rai said on Wednesday.A review meeting in this regard, which is to be presided over by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, is scheduled for Monday after which a decision will be taken, said Mr. Rai.“The review meeting will revolve around an analysis of the impact of the scheme on the basis of which a decision on the future of the odd-even scheme will be taken. This is in addition to a discussion on other anti-pollution measures,” Mr. Rai said at a press conference.The Transport minister added that the government will organise a ‘Thanksgiving event’ at the Chhatrasal stadium on January 17 to express the government’s gratitude to Delhiites for supporting the initiative and ‘making it a resounding success’.“The people of Delhi evidently accepted the odd-even scheme and supported it wholeheartedly. To thank them, the government has decided to organise the thanksgiving function,” he said.Mr. Rai also added that Mr. Kejriwal, the Delhi Cabinet, volunteers from various government departments, the Delhi Police, volunteers from Civil Defence, the NSS and representatives of the DMRC and the DTC would also be present at the event.In addition, the Transport Minister said the government’s next step towards ensuring lesser pollution would revolve around promoting cycling across Delhi — an issue that is likely to be discussed at the meeting.“The meeting on Monday will also focus on a discussion on how to promote cycling in Delhi. A committee will be formed to make the plan,” Mr. Rai said.On January 11, Mr. Rai had announced that as much as Rs. 1.5 crore, which had been generated from challans issued when the odd-even plan was in place, would be utilised to provide a subsidy on the purchase of cycles.The government is also working on creating exclusive cycle lanes across Delhi to attract more cyclists.
