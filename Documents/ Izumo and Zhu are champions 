Carlos was making surprisingly too many mistakes and it helped my cause. I simply kept the ball on the table for him to make mistakes.”For Zhu it was sweet revenge. “When I entered the arena for the final, the loss to Park Seri in the group match was at the back of my mind. I wanted to make amends for the [2-4] loss and was more determined.
