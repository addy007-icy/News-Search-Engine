While most young adults may have taken to a dance floor to celebrate the New Year, Sridaya Srivatsan was portraying the Bhakti-rasa while dancing on a Bangalore stage. Gifted with an infectious smile and gracious stage presence, the Indo-Canadian Bharatanatyam dancer’s dedication to the art form is refreshing.The 22-year-old Sridaya, who lives in Toronto, Canada, recently performed in Bangalore, and started learning Bharatanatyam at the age of four when she was in Oman.After her arangetram in 2008 under current guru Anuradha Jagannathan, she continued training, even performing at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha in Chennai. Sridaya remained dedicated, as she believes, “Not even a lifespan is enough to master a kala.” However, dancing Bharatanatyam in Canada presented challenges. “It is very difficult to be a dancer in a country like Canada or America, because you don’t get help as easily. You have to create your own opportunities. It’s not like here where there are so many organisations,” she explained, describing the difficulties in attending practices 85 km away from college during harsh Canadian winters. “I would battle snowstorms and use the bus. Sometimes, if I had too much schoolwork, I would literally just come for dance class, have dinner and head back.”Sridaya also describes herself as a music aficionado, enjoying several genres from across the world. This is understandable, as her mother, Sandhya Srivatsan, owns a music school. A recent graduate in Economics from the University of Waterloo, Sridaya wants to use her degree to help others. “In my future, I see myself working for the government or an NGO. I would love for dance and economics — these two worlds of mine — to intersect. I would love to use dance as a vehicle to spread goodness around the world.”
