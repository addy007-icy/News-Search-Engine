In a move to streamline demand for statues and memorials across the state, the Maharashtra government has restricted to two the number of memorials of the same national icon or respected personality across the state and has placed the onus of acquiring land and funds for more than two memorials on the concerned institution demanding for one.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis this week cleared a new policy for erecting memorials of national icons, historical figures, freedom fighters, saints and political leaders.It is unclear if the new policy will impact any of the three big memorial projects underway — the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial at Indu Mill, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray’s at Mayor’s Bungalow and Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial in the Arabian Sea — all of which are in various stages of planning.“There has been a growing demand for memorials from different institutions, and the Chief Minister had said that the state needed a policy framework for this. The policy will not impact any of the already announced memorials,” a spokesperson from CM’s office said.The guidelines issued under the policy specify that erecting statues cannot be construed as a memorial, and memorials should be built in socially useful forms like schools, colleges, hospitals, multi-purpose halls, research institutions, libraries and hostels. “Memorials should reflect various aspects of a national icon’s life and work, and efforts should be made to make them excellent tourist destinations. Instead of erecting memorials, socially useful schemes should be started and named after national icons,” a statement from CM’s Office said.The government will set up district-level committees which will include the Collector, Superintendent of Police, urban planners, executive engineers, zilla parishad chief executives, officials from archaeology and other departments, to approve memorials. This committee will follow the guidelines and based on availability of land send proposals to urban development department.The statement said the Tourism and Cultural Affairs Department will manage the announcements, maintenance, and other aspects of state-protected memorials, and the department will recommend to the Centre if any house or structure needs to be made into a national memorial. “If memorials are erected without prior permission from the government, urban development department and other departments will examine such memorials and after recovery of fines they will be regularised,” the statement said.A committee headed by CMDevendra Fadnavis will decide on memorials planned by the state.Policy guidelines specify that erecting statues can’t be construed as a memorial
