: Tuesday witnessed a sharp decline in the number of challans issued to motorists violating the recently-implemented odd-even rule. As against 1,997 motorists fined on Monday, only 1,247 were prosecuted on Tuesday.It was the traffic police that wore a much relaxed look after appearing very active a day ago. They prosecuted just 401 violators as opposed to 1,040 a day before.Even though senior traffic officers claimed there were fewer violators out on the roads, prosecution figures by the revenue department and the transport department revealed otherwise.With 207 cars being challaned by the transport department on Tuesday, they bettered their Monday’s performance in which 191 motorists were booked.Though the number of offenders booked by the revenue department on Tuesday dipped compared to the previous day, it was still above the traffic police’s performance. As against 766 prosecutions by the revenue department on Monday, Tuesday saw them fine 639 violators.Traffic cops deployed at the ITO intersection halted odd-even prosecution for at least an hour when The Hindu checked on them. While the policemen there attributed their decision to “heavy traffic”, the vehicular rush was not unusually heavy. Subsequently, violators passed the intersection without any obstruction.Several motorists that The Hindu spoke to said they came across fewer traffic cops as compared to the previous day.Muktesh Chander, Special CP (Traffic), however, denied any reduction in the number of personnel deployed for the operation.Though the traffic cops showed some laxity, outdoor broadcasting (OB) vans and even politicians were not spared for violating the rules.A civil defence volunteers tried to keep spirits high. “Give us the power to issue challans and very few of these violators will escape,” said one, pointing to some offenders merrily driving away.
