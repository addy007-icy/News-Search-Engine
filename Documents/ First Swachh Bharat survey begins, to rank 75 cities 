The Quality Council of India (QCI) has been commissioned to conduct an extensive survey to study the progress of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship Swachh Bharat Mission and rank 75 cities based on sanitation and cleanliness.Called “Swachh Survekshan”, the survey began on January 5. It will cover all State capitals and 52 other cities with population of more than one million. The survey has been commissioned by the Union Urban Development ministry and will involve data collection from municipal bodies, direct observation and citizens’ feedback.Over 110 assessors with more than 10 years’ experience will visit municipal offices to assess various parameters. They will visit 42 locations including planned colonies, public toilets, bus stands, railway stations, religious places in each city and grade the cleanliness levels.Photographs of these locations will be geo-tagged and loaded on tablets to be sent on real time basis to a central control room. Citizens’ feedback will sought through telephone calls asking them six questions on cleanliness and availability of toilets.QCI officials said the survey has covered 25 cities in Phase I including New Delhi, Kanpur, Patna, Varanasi, Guwahati, Bengaluru, Indore, Coimbatore, Kozhikode and Nagpur. In Phase II, which started on Friday, cities such as Chandigarh, Bhopal, Mysore and Gangtok are being covered.The government had conducted a base-year pre-survey across 476 cities before the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission in October 2014.The ongoing survey, which will be conducted till January 20, will tally its findings with the October 2014 data to measure the progress made by the 75 cities.The results will be announced on on the MyGov website. The door-to-door garbage collection and disposal of municipal solid waste in all 83,000 wards in urban areas was one of the objectives of the Swachh Bharat Mission.The survey will evaluate six measurable aspects of sanitation and hygiene. The strategies to be evaluated will be tackling of open defecation and integrated solid waste management; information, education and behaviour change; sweeping and door-to-door collection; transportation of solid waste; processing and disposal of solid waste; provision of public and community toilet seats; and construction of household individual toilets.
