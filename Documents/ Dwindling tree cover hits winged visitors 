The declining number of tamarind trees in this village, known as favourite nesting spot for winged visitors from far-off lands, continues to take a toll on the phenomenon of annual migration of painted storks to this small village in Khammam rural mandal.The village has attracted a few dozens of painted storks this season so far. The significant drop in the number of migratory birds impacted the festival-like atmosphere usually associated with the migratory season in the village.Only a few dozen painted storks had arrived in the village so far in the current season, said Krishna of Chintapalli.“We are still optimistic of arrival of more number of winged visitors by the month-end,” he said.The drop in the number of migratory birds is a clear indication of the dwindling tree cover and drying up water sources in the vicinity of our village, points out an elderly person of Chintapalli.It was high time the government departments took oncrete steps in association with the villagers and NGOs to conserve the existing tamarind trees and expand the green cover to attract more feathered guests to our village, he said.
