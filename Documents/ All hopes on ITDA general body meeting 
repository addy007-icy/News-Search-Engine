People living in far-flung areas of the tribal sub-plan mandal of Gundala in Kothagudem division are awaiting a concrete outcome from the general body meeting of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, to be held in Gundala on Thursday.Major issues such as water scarcity, long pending Yellendu-Gundala road works, and lack of permanent bus stand facility and absence of a petrol bunk in the Agency mandal are likely to be raised by the elected representatives concerned during the crucial ITDA general body meeting.The last general body meeting of the ITDA was held in Bhadrachalam in September last year, after a long gap of 15 months. The meeting was chaired by Collector D.S. Lokesh Kumar.As decided in the previous meeting, the ITDA authorities have made elaborate arrangements to hold the general body (the highest decision making body) meeting in the remote Gundala on Thursday.“People of our Agency mandal are pinning their hopes on the crucial meeting and expecting us (the elected representatives) to raise their grievances as well as the long pending development issues before the ITDA’s general body,” says Gundala mandal praja parishad (MPP) president Ch Padma.
