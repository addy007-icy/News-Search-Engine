Borders connecting the National Capital Region to Delhi went largely unchecked on the first day of odd-even policy implementation.Even as a large number of commuters were seen following the rule and travelled in odd-numbered cars, some vehicles with even number also entered the Capital from the NCR region due to lack of checking.While the Delhi Traffic police had earlier said that they will deploy teams at major points in the city including at the borders like NH-8, NH-24, the plan was tweaked at the last moment and there was no police presence on the borders. Police attributed this to traffic management.A senior Delhi Police officer said: “There was no checking on NH-8 and NH-24 because we did not want traffic jams on major roads leading to the city. If anything happens on NH-24, the city gets jammed upto east Delhi and the traffic situation gets unmanageable. We had our teams deployed at main junctions in the city. Any violator who entered in a car with even number must have been challaned by them.”There was no checking on NH-24 on the Ghazipur intersection that connects Uttar Pradesh to Delhi either.There were however civil defence volunteers who stood under the Ghazipur flyover and distributed flowers and pamphlets to commuters.Similar scenes were seen on NH-8 in Gurgaon as well. There was no checking on the Mehrauli-Gurgaon road that connects Delhi to Haryana. There were however some civil defence volunteer seen under the Arjangarh flyover distributing flowers.However, unlike other border areas of Delhi that connect it to neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the 'Apsara' border saw heavy deployment of police personnel on Friday.
