Twenty-one families that had lost their houses in sea erosion along the Alappuzha coast earlier would be rehabilitated at the Purakkad Mannumpuram colony. The process of filling the land at the low-lying site is in progress. The families have been staying in relief camps at Purakkad ever since they lost their homes.The title deeds of the land would be handed over to the beneficiaries within a week, District Collector N. Padmakumar said. He was addressing a meeting of the officials on Saturday.The soil to fill the site is being brought from Thottapally where Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) has been separating minerals from the sand being collected from the harbour there. The sand is being removed from the harbour as per a government order. About 20,000 cubic metre soil would be removed from the harbour and the cost involved would be borne by IREL. The sand will be transported to Purakkad after examination by the engineering department of the harbour. Irrigation and revenue departments would monitor the sand-filling at Purakkad. The Collector has asked officials to maintain records on the sand received from Thottapally.The plots for 21 families were allocated in December last year. The sand-filling is expected to be completed within a week. The Collector has also asked the officials to demarcate private land so that the extent of allocated land will be clear.
