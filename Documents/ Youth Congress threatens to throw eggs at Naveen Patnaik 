The Odisha Youth Congress on Sunday threatened to throw eggs at Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik within next 15 days despite round-the-clock tight security around him.Speaking to newsmen during his visit to the city to review Youth Congress organisation in Berhampur parliamentary constituency, the body’s general secretary Niranjan Nayak said eggs would be thrown at the CM to protest against irregularities in the list of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and rising unemployment in the State.“It would also be a protest against slapping of Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC against Youth Congress activists who had thrown eggs at the CM in Bhubaneswar on February 19, 2015,”he said.But Mr Nayak did not elaborate where this would take place -- in Bhubaneswar or elsewhere.All-India Youth Congress (AIYC) secretary and Odisha observer Purna Chandra Padhi, who was in Berhampur, said it has been decided to protest against all MLAs, MPs and Ministers of the ruling BJD everywhere in the State. When asked about any definite mode of protest, Mr Padhi said it is for the party activists to decide as most protest demonstrations are spontaneous acts.Speaking on possibility of aggravation of situation as the BJD leaders have also declared to retaliate, the AIYC secretary claimed the Congress was opposed to any kind of violence. “Our protests would never cause any physical harm to anyone,” Mr Padhi reiterated.
