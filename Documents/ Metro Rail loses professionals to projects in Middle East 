Over the last two years, workers of Chennai Metro Rail project, including engineers and supervisors, are said to have left the project to take up work at similar projects in the Middle East, including those in Doha.Attrition, sources with Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) say, has contributed to some problems, including delay in the completion of work.“One set of workers are trained for a while and then they leave; this has led to problems of continuity and delay in the work too,” the sources said.Officials of CMRL said this was routine and nothing to be worried about. “People do leave projects for better pay; but not many have left the project. This has not affected our work. The problem we face is that labourers go on leave and the contractors just make do with the available resources,” an official said.One of the workers, who went to work at the Doha Metro Rail project, said, “Several people from Chennai Metro Rail have started working here for a while now; this is because they are getting better pay and international exposure as well. I am quite happy working here. This will certainly lead to delay in the work and other problems too.”
