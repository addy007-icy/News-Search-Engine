For the second day in a row, group dance enthralled the capital, but there were good turnouts for many other events too on the sixth day of the 56th State School Arts Festival.It was as if the cityâ€™s residents wanted to enjoy the cultural fare at least towards the fag end; the week-long festival concludes on Monday, when there would be just a few events staged.On Sunday, though was fascinating action in a dozen venues across the capital. The highlight, certainly, was the group dance.The event invariably keeps the audience glued to their seats. Even late into Saturday night, the Putharikandam Ground was crowded.Those spectators were not disappointed by the High School girls, who presented some varied themes as well, such as the legend of Swami Ayyappan and the legendary romance of Moideen and Kanchanamala, inspired by the film Ennu Ninte Moideen .The folk dance at the VJT Hall too proved a big hit with the holiday audience. The penultimate day also featured competitions in drama, which once again ran into problems, because of inadequate acoustics, Oppana, Nadan Pattu, Parirchamuttukali, Chavittu Natakam, Vanchippattu, Chakyarkoothu, Nadaswaram and Nangiarkoothu, Thayambaka and Veena.
