She finds herself at ease with the people and connects with them instantly, as she reminds them of her achievements as the former First Citizen of the city. And the biggest advantage was people recognising her immediately given her stint as the first Mayor of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).Banda Karthika Reddy, former Mayor, who is testing her luck again from Tarnaka division, is recalling her contribution to the Tarnaka division and the city as the Mayor to attract the voters.“I have spent more than Rs. 60 crore in the division, which is the highest by any Corporator in the city,” she said, exuding confidence of her win as she met people in Pardhiwada on Wednesday morning.Her biggest advantage, she felt, was her earlier stint as Mayor, as people recall her face and also the work.“I am always available and anyone could walk into my house freely. It is not the case with my opponents, as the voters don’t even know them, leave alone recognising their contribution.”With folder hands, she reminded the people of the 172 houses she built in Rajeev Nagar, and promises similar work.Her biggest contribution, she said, was the sports stadium built in Lalapet with Rs. 10 crore and several gymnasiums for the youth. People welcomed her with a smile as she reminded them of the Mahila Bhavans, a concept she designed as Mayor, in every locality.When the minority voters came, she took assurance of support recalling the Urdu school she started in Lalapet and also a separate burial ground for them.Raj Kumar, a voter, recalled the library opened at Lalapet with her support.The former Mayor also played the sentiment card with the voters as to how they want to see their former Mayor again in the GHMC council.“My word will have strength in the council and residents of Tarnaka division know how it can help bring more funds to the division,” she said, as her campaign entered into lanes of Manikehwari Nagar.Her husband, Banda Chandra Reddy, senior Congress leader, accompanying her claimed he is surprised at the positive response.s“Our hard work will play dividends.”
