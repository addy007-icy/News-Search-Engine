The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Statewide ‘Vimochana Yatra’ led by its State president Kummanam Rajasekharan, eyeing to consolidate its support base ahead of the Assembly elections, began on Wednesday with Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu calling for exposing the hollow assurances of the Congress and CPI(M)-led fronts in the State.The CPI(M) and the Congress, which have been ruling the State in succession over the years, had ruined the State economy and muted the aspirations of the people, Mr. Naidu said at the well-attended function at Uppala to flag off the march.Though the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) could boast of quite a few leaders like A.K. Antony and V.S. Achuthanandan with clean images, most leaders of the alliances represented by the two parties were involved in steep corruption, he alleged, pointing out that the solar panel scam and the bar licence bribery charges were just a few instances.The BJP’s vision was all-round development and justice for all, without any special affinity to any particular section, he said.He said the 18-month corruption-free rule of the BJP-led National Democratic Front had ushered in a series of fast-paced developmental initiatives in the country. Claiming that political wind in the country was blowing in favour of the BJP, Mr. Naidu said Kerala could not afford to turn a blind eye towards the emerging situation.
