Member of Parliament and AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to have compassion towards Dalit students on the UoH campus.Speaking at the university, he said: It is appalling that such a young student, had to kill himself because he has a different ideology. Just because he did not subscribe to ABVP principles, can he be considered anti-national?”Mr. Owaisi wanted the Prime Minister to intervene and lift the expulsion of the other four students who are still on a strike on the campus. Mr. Owaisi said he will raise the issue in the Parliament as well.Mr. Owaisi said, MHRD’s stand on pursuing a matter concerning a university can be considered direct intervention with specific motives.“I also request Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao to give Mr. Vemula’s family compensation for their loss. They should also be included in the two bedroom housing scheme of the government,” Mr. Owaisi said.
