Does reading have a therapeutic effect? Eminent writer M.T. Vasudevan Nair would vouch for this.A story he had written on his grand nephew Rahulan, who chose to forget his severe pains by constantly reading while battling leukemia, is one that highlights those aspects of reading that are seldom discussed.The article, which was recently published in the Mathrubhumi weekly, was selected for a reading session that was organised by Malayalam Pallikkoodam at the Sree Saradadevi Shishu Vihar UP School in Vazhuthacaud on Sunday.In his work, the Jnanpith laureate spoke of how eight-year-old Rahulan refused to give in to his losing battle to the disease. Despite his sufferings, the child never ceased to read and continued to immerse himself in the worlds created by the much-celebrated writers including Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, P. Kesavadev, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer and Uroob. The books that were provided by his grand-uncle were his constant companions during his final days in the hospital room until his death in 1993.Many enthusiastic children, some accompanied by their parents, gathered on the school premises to participate in the reading session that was led by poet V. Madhusoodanan Nair.Introducing the story to the children, Mr. Nair said that Rahulan found refuge and solace in the words of the books he read. The article was testimony to the belief that any pain could be overcome by reading.He also urged the parents to encourage their children to become passionate readers and to understand the world around them through the works of the writers. Later, six selected children took turns in reading the portions of the article.
