The Holehonnur police have arrested a man on the charge of attempting to murder his daughter.The police gave the name of the arrested as Shivamurthappa (45), a farmer from Chandanakere village. According to the police, Shalini, elder daughter of the accused, was in love with a youth from the same village and their marriage had been fixed on January 6. Shivamurthappa had initially opposed the marriage, but gave his consent later, owing to the pressure exerted by relatives of both families. Shivamurthappa had told his relatives that his daughter had brought disrepute to him.Upset with Shalini, Shivamurthappa allegedly conspired to kill her on Saturday night. He entered the room where his three daughters were sleeping. Misidentifying Shaila, his second daughter for Shalini, he stabbed the girl with an iron rod and moved out of the room. On hearing a hue and cry raised by the injured girl and her sister, the neighbours rushed to the house, and Shivamurthappa pretended ignorance about the incident.He even took the injured Shaila to a private hospital in Manipal for treatment. The police got suspicious and began interrogating Shivamurthappa, when he confessed to having tried to kill his daughter.
