The Vodafone-Rotary Parallel Music Fest, a special platform for the differently abled to showcase their talent, took off on Tuesday with the conferring of awards on two differently abled artistes, violinist Prabhakar Dhakde and vocalist S.R. Maruthi Prasad.The ‘Distinguished Differently Abled Artiste’ award was conferred on Mr. Dhakde and the ‘Most Promising Differently Abled Artiste’ award went to Mr. Prasad.N. Murali, president of Music Academy, said: “creative history has been replete with artists who have risen above their disability and many have been so brilliant. While the mainstream does not provide a level-playing field, it is necessary for a special platform like this for them to be recognised. But this does not mean they did not do well in the mainstream. Take Mr. Prasad, for instance, he has featured in the regular Music Academy season on some occasions.”Mr. Prasad said he felt humbled by this honour. “I have got this only because of my guru and God. I am deeply thankful for this award,” he said.
