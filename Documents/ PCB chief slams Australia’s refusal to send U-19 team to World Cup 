Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan fears a chaotic situation developing in the ICC following > Australia’s refusal to send its under-19 squad to Bangladesh for the World Cup.Khan told today that he saw no reason for Cricket Australia’s decision.“They have said they have taken decision on government advice and because of security reasons. But we will take up this issue at the ICC board meeting in February,” the PCB chief said.“You can’t have this happening all the time whenever it is about Asian countries. I fear it could lead to creation of blocs and cause chaos in ICC,” Khan said.He was also clear that the security situation in Bangladesh didn’t warrant such a response from Australia.“The last time also we discussed this in the ICC and raised valid concerns,” he added.Last October Cricket Australia had withdrawn from a Test tour to Bangladesh on security grounds. The ICC World Youth Cup is scheduled from later this month.Khan said that one couldn’t have a situation where select member countries kept on pulling out of planned tours.“Cricket is being held all over the subcontinent and as far as security issues are concerned they are there everywhere in the world. After the recent incidents in Europe it is clear it can happen anywhere. But the World Cup is an ICC event and security was their responsibility and yet Australia pulled out,” he said.The PCB chief said Pakistan would take up the issue strongly with the ICC.“Blocs will be formed and it will be chaotic. Cricket boards need to work things out ahead of a tour or tournament and keep the ICC informed.”No Test team has toured Pakistan since March 2009 when militants attacked the Sri Lankan team in Lahore.Since then only associate members such as Afghanistan, Kenya and Zimbabwe have played in Pakistan.“When Zimbabwe came there were security concerns but we showed that if the right impenetrable security plan was in place cricket could be played anywhere,” he said.
