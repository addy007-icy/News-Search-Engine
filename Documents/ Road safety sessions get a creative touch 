: Going beyond conventional seminars and discussions, a four-day Road Safety Awareness campaign currently under way under the headship of the City police has a slew of creative programmes with a mission to grab more public attention through field-level activities.To mark the launch, the campaigners — mostly comprising traffic police personnel and Student Police Cadets conducted an on-the-road awareness session on Saturday — flagging down motorcyclists who were not wearing helmets.Instead of slapping fines, they were given toffees and a gentle reminder on the risk involved in riding without helmets.Those who had not fastened the chin strap were also stopped to pass on the safety lessons.“On Sunday, the main programme was a drawing and painting contest for students and the general public on the theme — Road Safety. It drew huge participation,” said a coordinator of the programme. A quiz programme too was held for the elders on the same theme.Exclusive training on basic life support for students and the public would be the highlight of the district-level awareness programmes on Monday. Officials from the Motor Vehicles Department will coordinate the programme, to be held at West Hill Government Engineering College and Beypore Government High School. Arrangements have been made to ensure the participation of expert doctors in both these sessions.On the final day on Tuesday, the department will organise free medical camp for drivers and for the general public to test eyesight and hearing ability.According to officials, the medical camp will be organised mainly to check the fitness of persons who have taken up driving as a full-time career. “Poor vision and low hearing have been found to be major reasons for many accidents and timely medical intervention can do a lot to address it,” they said.City Police Commissioner Uma Behera said the closing ceremony would also provide an opportunity to the family members of road accident victims to share their experience. “Ahead of that, a vehicle rally too will be organised in the city from Ramanattukara to Kozhikode beach displaying the message of traffic safety,” she added.
