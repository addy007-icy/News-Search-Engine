If your eyes were set on the arc formed by the pavilions erected in honour of Sunil Gavaskar, Vitthal Divecha and the Mumbai Cricket Association, you would mistake the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy for an IPL game. When nearly 3,000 spectators turn up for a domestic tie at the Wankhede Stadium, you are allowed to use the word ‘sizeable’.All those fans got their money’s worth — actually, they didn’t have to shell out a paisa — as Uttar Pradesh thumped two-time champion Baroda by 38 runs to win the inter-state Twenty20 tournament on Wednesday evening.If opener Prashant Gupta (49, 41b, 5x4, 1x6) and skipper Suresh Raina (47 n.o., 37b, 2x4, 2x6) did the job with the bat, spin twins Piyush Chawla (4-0-16-0) and Kuldeep Yadav (4-0-12-2) choked the life out of Baroda.Baroda skipper Irfan Pathan’s decision to send Uttar Pradesh in was spot-on given the sluggish nature of the wicket. But Gupta and fellow opener Samarth Singh (19, 13b, 1x4, 2x6) gave their team an excellent start by smashing 37 runs in five overs.Guptacaned Irfan for a couple of fours in the third over of the innings. Uttar Pradesh scored 47 runs in the PowerPlay, losing Gupta to Hardik Pandya.Raina was kept quiet in the middle overs when Baroda managed to pick up four wickets. Raina began with a characteristic loft over cover for four. His next boundary came after 14 deliveries when he carted off-spinner Soaeb Tai for a huge six over long-off.Tai almost got his revenge a few overs later but wicketkeeper Pinal Shah missed a stumping chance. Raina closed the innings with a brilliant pick-up shot over square-leg after Irfan got the execution of his yorker slightly wrong.Uttar Pradesh scored 47 in the PowerPlay, 73 in the first 10 overs and 90 in the second half of the innings. Baroda had raced to 20 by the second over but, thereafter, it lost three quick wickets to be reduced to 54 for three in the eighth over. Hardik Pandya, who had batted brilliantly throughout the tournament, hit a couple of fours before chinaman bowler Yadav had him caught and bowled for 13.Deepak Hooda also perished for a run-a-ball 15, but the biggest disappointment of the evening was Yusuf Pathan, who scratched his way to a painful 14 off — hold your breath — 27 deliveries with no boundary to his name.There was a passage of play during which Baroda went as many as 55 balls without a hit to or over the fence.The scores: Uttar Pradesh 163 for seven in 20 overs (Prashant Gupta 49, Suresh Raina 47 n.o., Bharghav Bhatt two for 13) bt Baroda 125 for seven in 20 overs (Soaeb Tai 26 n.o., Ankit Rajpoot three for 30, Amit Mishra two for 32, Kuldeep Yadav two for 12).
