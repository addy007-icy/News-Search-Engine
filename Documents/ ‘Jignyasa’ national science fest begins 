The sixth edition of the national-level science model making contest and exhibition ‘Jignyasa-2016’ began here on Monday with over 170 teams participating in it.Agastya International Foundation has organised the three-day event in association with the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation and Deshpande Foundation.Inaugurating the contest and exhibition being held at the specially erected pandal at Nehru Stadium here, Sri Siddheshwara Swami of Jnana Yogashrama, Vijayapura, emphasised the need for encouraging children to observe the world around them and seek answers for the questions that arise in their minds.“You should motivate children to develop scientific spirit and ask questions. And you should also encourage them to go in the quest of the answers for their questions. If one inspires them to take up the quest, then it might lead the birth of an inventor,” he said.Referring to scientist Thomas Alva Edison and Indian saint and philosopher Kanaad, who came with the theory that the world was all about particles, Sri Siddeshwar Swami said that the students should first have the spirit of observation, enquiry, dedication, experimentation and logical mathematics to become scientists.Chairman of Agastya International Foundation, Ramji Raghavan said that the country’s diversity itself led to creativity and the spirit of questioning.Co-founder of Deshpande Foundation Jaishree Deshpande said that no problem was big for the children as they had the ability to think beyond the set rules and laws. Hubballi-Dharwad Mayor Ashwini Majjagi, president of Hubballi-Dharwad ISKCON Rajiv Lochan Dasa, Sri Basaveshwara Swami of Kundagol, and HDMC commissioner C.M. Noor Mansoor were present.
