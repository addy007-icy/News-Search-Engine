Data theft, breach of confidentiality and unauthorised access, which have become the bane of computer users, are likely to threaten smartphone users too in the coming years.With the ‘threat exposure rate’ of Android smartphones in the U.S. and Australia already overtaking that of PCs, India is not far behind, Ayush Tiwari, who made a poster presentation on the ‘Study of important security features of Android, Windows for Mobile, iOS and BlackBerry operating systems’ at the 103rd Indian Science Congress here, told The Hindu .Though in India, the threat to Android phones is less than 10 per cent of that to PCs, their ubiquitous use and rising data consumption make mobile devices vulnerable, he said. “In the U.S. and Australia, dependence of phone users on PCs has reduced. Soon, it’ll happen in India, too,” Mr. Tiwari said.Referring to a Nielson survey, Mr. Tiwari – a student of engineering and technology, Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, Indore, who made the poster presentation along with fellow student Bhavesh Jaiswal and professor Pratosh Bansal of the same institution – said 50 per cent of the 40 million smartphone users in India were under 25. “They do not guard against malware, and are prone to experiment by downloading unsafe programmes,” he said. “When data is stolen, contacts lists are sold to advertisers for telemarketing. Online shoppers will find e-commerce company advertisements showing up on their Facebook page,” he said. The intrusion of a malware into smartphones can cause the device to slow down and allow unwanted advertisements to show up, he said.
