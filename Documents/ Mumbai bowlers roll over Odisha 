Mumbai rode on a successful all-round bowling performance to make short work of Odisha in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy inter-State T20 Group D match here at the Barabati Stadium on Saturday.Dhawal Kulkarni (2/17), Shardul Thakur (2/11), Rohan Raje (2/18), Abhishek Nayar (2/21) and Pravin Tambe (2/20) — the five bowlers used by Mumbai — shared the wickets to restrict Odisha, which was asked to bat first, to 91 in 17.4 overs. Abhishek Yadav top-scored for the host with 33 (31b, 3x4, 1x6).The match was reduced to an 18-over affair as fog and overcast conditions forced a delayed start. Mumbai captain Aditya Tare, released by Mumbai Indians two days ago, struck a confident 32 (33b, 5x4) and shared a 47-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Siddhesh Lad (31*, 30b, 5x4) to set Mumbai on the victory course. Tare's men will now face a totterning Karnataka on Sunday.Services stun KarnatakaMeanwhile, Services tamed a star-studded Karnataka by three wickets in another Group D tie. The feature of the day was the way Services cast aside its underdog status to stupefy Karnataka, which boasted a host of national team players.Put in to bat, Karnataka stuttered from the start as opener Mohammad Taha lasted only two balls before he was scalped by Services pacer Raushan Raj.Mayank Agarwal and Robin Uthappa sought to accelerate the Karnataka innings after the initial blow, but Raj got Agarwal (16) edging one to wicketkeeper Nakul Verma to end the second-wicket partnership of 38 before it could spell further danger.It was up to Uthappa to get Karnataka back of track but his wicket started a procession to the dugout as Karnataka was reduced to 71 for six in the 12th over.Captain Vinay Kumar stemmed the slide with a doughty effort, pairing in a 44-run partnership for the seventh wicket with young left-arm spinner J. Suchith Kumar, to help Karnataka reach a fighting total of 121 for nine.In reply, Services sunk to 52 for three, and later to 67 for five.But Yashpal Singh (25) and Sumit Singh (20) put on a 32-run partnership for the sixth wicket to see Services home.BRIEF SCORESAt Cuttack (Group D): Odisha 91 in 17.4 ovs (Abhishek Yadav 33; Dhawal Kulkarni 2/17, Shardul Thakur 2/11) lost to Mumbai 95/4 in 15.5 ovs (Aditya Tare 32, Siddhesh Lad 31*; Deepak Behera 2/14).Karnataka 121/9 (Vinay Kumar 38, Robin Uthappa 22; R Raj 3/19, Deepak Rai 2/21) lost to Services 122/7 in 19 ovs (Aanshul Gupta 27, Yashpal Singh 25; KC Cariappa 2/20).Maharashtra 109/7 in 12 ovs (Kedar Jadhav 52*; Piyush Chawla 4/28) lost to Uttar Pradesh 113/3 in 11.2 ovs (Prashant Gupta 35, Umang Sharma 32*, Akshdeep Nath 34*)
