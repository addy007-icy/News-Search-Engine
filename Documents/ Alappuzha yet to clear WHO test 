A month-long sample medical survey conducted among schoolchildren in Alappuzha district for traces of microfilaria has yielded alarming results.The number of children found to be carriers of microfilaria is more than World Health Organizationâ€™s permissible levels for declaration of a district as filariasis-free.Though the results have not been announced officially, reliable sources told The Hindu that the tests have yielded results which indicate the presence of microfilaria beyond safe levels.The Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) for testing the presence of microfilaria has been conducted by testing the blood of children of 1st and 2nd standards, selected at random. The exercise has been held in conformity with WHO guidelines.TAS kits have been provided by WHO and the random selection of schools and children has been done with the help of WHO software.Under a plan of action drafted for conducting the tests, the district has been divided into two evaluation units: Alappuzha North (EU1), consisting of Cherthala and Ambalappuzha taluks, and Alappuzha South, (EU2), consisting of Kuttanad, Karthikapally, Chengannur and Mavelikara taluks.The tests have been conducted on 1,552 children belonging to 30 schools in EU1 and 1,552 children in 36 schools in EU2.A drop of blood has been taken from each child for the test. The survey has been completed in schools under EU2. Tests would have to be done in one more school under EU1. The survey has been conducted after the Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programme when medicines for consumption had been distributed among people.Blood smear samples have been collected at night and examined for the presence of worms. The number of microfilaria positive cases detected from the blood sample examinations conducted in 2015 is 5, which represented a microfilaria rate of 0.023 per cent, sources said.The TAS programme has been conducted with a view to ascertaining whether the presence of microfilaria is low to be eligible for declaration of the district as filariasis-free.
