A survey has to be done on the status of OSR (Open Space Reserve) land right from 1971, which is the year the Town Planning Act was enforced, said G. Santhanam, former member secretary of Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority.Speaking at a seminar on “Governance of public places and avoidance of illegal constructions” Mr. Santhanam said “the layout promoters are not handing over to local bodies. It is supposed to be maintained for the common good. It will run into thousands of acres. It may not be available as on date.”Pointing to encroachment of waterbodies, Mr. Santhanam said town planning for the poor people with sufficient funding would reduce such illegal encroachments of waterbodies.Madras Institute of Development Studies Professorial Consultant S.Janakarajan said planners failed to conduct risk analysis before expanding the Chennai Metropolitan Area.“We need to have mitigation strategies. But we are resorting to high-cost technology without reviewing our own situation,” said Dr. Janakarajan. Our urbanisation is based on the concept of always getting the best and dumping the waste back. We take land for urban development and dispose of solid waste in periurban areas. ” he added.
