Cricketer Sreesanth takes on a new role with the Hyderabad team in the upcoming season of Celebrity Cricket League (CCL) — he will be their bowling coach and advise actors on how to improve their skills. “They are like my brothers,” he said, “I will be using the CCL platform to play on international grounds and be match-fit whenever the ban on me is lifted. I’m 32 now, and am still hopeful of making a comeback to the Indian team.”Life seems to be good for the cricketer off the ground as well. He’s busy with films; more than half of his upcoming Bollywood movie is complete. “It has been directed by Pooja Bhatt and has come out well,” he says of the film, in which he reportedly plays a Malayali who mentors a dancer.That’s not all… he is also set to star in a Tamil-Telugu bilingual that will kickstart soon. “I play a cricketer in that film. I would love to be part of Tamil movies soon,” he adds.
