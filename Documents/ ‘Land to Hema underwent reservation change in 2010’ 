Days after facing criticism over not following procedure to change reservation of plot allotted to Bollywood actor and BJP MP Hema Malini’s dance school, state Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse on Friday said the Urban Development Department (UDD) had completed the procedure way back in 2010.Three days ago, Ms Malini’s trust Natyavihar Kala Kendra was given possession of the 2,000 sq m plot in a prime locality at Ambivli in Andheri.Activists had raised concerns over changing the reservation of this plot from garden to arts centre.“The process of changing the reservation by following due procedure, which involves taking suggestions and objections from people was completed in year 2010 itself. The present case was in public domain since then,” said Mr Khadse.The State UDD, in its notification dated July 30, 2010, sanctioned the modification of designation of around 2,000 sq m land out of total of 29,360.50 sq m from garden to Natyavihar Kala Kendra. “The notification was issued then and our department has only ensured that the plot is handed over to the trust by adhering to all conditions,” said Mr Khadse.As per the notification, Ms Malini’s trust had initially demanded 1,741.89 sq m plot at Versova. The Revenue department, through its letter dated January 3, 1997, had issued orders to Mumbai Suburban Collector to hand over the plot with written undertaking from the trust that it will pay the total cost of the land. The possession was given to the trust in April 4, 1997. The trust even paid Rs 10 lakh on January 2, 2002.However, the trust sought another plot as the Versova land fell in Coastal Zone Regulation area and no construction was possible. Following it, the trust sought 5,000 sq m plot at Ambivli in Andheri. Subsequently, notification for 2,000 sq m was issued in 2010 and it was handed over to Ms Malini last week.Mr Khadse said that while arts centre will be built on 2,000 sq m land, the rest of the plot has to be developed by the trust with its own money into a public garden.The previous land at Versova with Ms Malini’s trust will be returned to the State government and only after that the possession of new plot will be given.“My department will recommend invoking garden reservation on that land in Versova,” said Mr Khadse.
