Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s belated regret in the face of nationwide protests for justice for Rohith Vemula came as no great solace to anyone (“ >Mother India lost a dear son, says PM as students protest”, Jan. 23). It is not difficult to discern that utterance of anything more substantive in support of those at the bottom of Hinduism’s hereditary hierarchy would have dented his image and weakened his standing in the larger Sangh Parivar.He didn’t show the fortitude needed by condemning the events leading to the suicide. Neither did he sack the two Union Ministers — Smriti Irani and Bangaru Dattatreya — involved in the controversy. Had he admitted that the Dalit scholar’s suicide was a result of the caste prejudices on the campus, his public display of emotion would have struck the intended chord with the people. The Prime Minister must first show the will to repudiate the scriptures that sanctify caste; take efforts to promote inter-caste marriages; and announce a special economic package for Dalits. Only then will he have any right to speak of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s dream and Dalit welfare.G. David Milton,Maruthancode
