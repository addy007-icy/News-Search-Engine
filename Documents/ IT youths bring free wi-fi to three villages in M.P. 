Inspired by the Centre’s flagship ‘Digital India’ initiative, four IT professionals from Madhya Pradesh have enabled 3 villages in the State’s Rajgarh district to have access to ‘free wi-fi’“Taking a cue from Digital India theme, we have turned Bavadikeda Jagir, Shivnathpura and Devria villages into free wi-fi hamlets to provide the fruits of IT revolution to the villagers,” one of the four youths, Shakeel Anjum, told PTI over phone.“We have decided to do it on our own to set an example and spent nearly Rs 2 lakh from our resources to achieve the target,” he claimed.“Its results are for everyone to see as nearly 100 mobile users are now using wi-fi facility in these villages which is running uninterrupted. We have also installed a 200 Ampere power inverter to ensure round—the—clock facility in the event of a power cut there,” he said.Four youths in these villages were also using laptops and even a Bank of India kiosk is running its affairs smoothly with the help of this facility, Mr Anjum claimed.Lauding them for their efforts made without any government support, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday said they have set an example for others to follow.“Heartening to note our four talented youths have turned three remote villages of Rajgarh district into first free wi—fi hamlets in India,” Mr Chouhan said in a series of tweets after coming to know about the initiative.“Initiative of Shakeel Anjum, Tushar, Bhanu, and Abhishek in taking power of e-governance to remote villages is highly laudable,” he said.“This team of technical experts not only displayed immense potential of our youth but also set an exemplary example for others to follow,” Chouhan added.The Chief Minister said that his government “highly appreciates the initiative and directed the officials to look into their plans and take necessary decision on funding at the earliest possible.”The free wi-fi service was formally launched in these villages by District Collector Tarun Kumar Pithode on January 1. -- PTI
