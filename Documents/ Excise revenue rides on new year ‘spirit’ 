The New Year’s Eve saw soaring sales of various liquor brands which jacked up the excise revenue in the temple town.The Tirupati Urban Circle of the Prohibition and Excise Department, comprising the temple city and its immediate areas, guzzles up liquor nearly as much as the rest of Chittoor district does, thanks to the large number of wine shops, star hotels, bars and needless to say, the huge floating population.As excise became the major source of revenue for the funds-strapped State, the department pushed off as much stock as possible in the last couple of months, but the dealers literally found the pressure too much to bear as they could not sell beyond what the market could actually absorb.The year-end should have come as a blessing in disguise for the retailers in the form of higher sales, but then the additional stock thrust again on them and the restrictions on timings gave less manoeuvring space.“November 2015 witnessed sale of 318339 litres of IM liquor and 110206 litres of beer, which turned out to be 319968 and 163119 litres respectively for December,” said B. Indira, Circle Inspector (Tirupati Urban).In fact, the figure is much lesser than what should have actually come into the excise kitty.The New Year’s Eve falling on a Thursday apparently did not augur well for the liquor outlets, as many devout preferred to stay sober. There are liquor outlets at Gajulamandyam, Daminedu, Avilala (near Balaji dairy) and Chandragiri on the Chennai-Bengaluru highway running south of the city, which, though registered higher sales, fell short of New Year’s Eve expectations.“We sell Rs.1.15 lakh worth of stock every day, which goes up to Rs.3 lakh to Rs.3.25 lakh on the New Year’s Eve. Our business was just Rs.2.1 lakh this time,” said a dealer on condition of anonymity.The department attributes the fall to a variety of reasons. The ‘Nakabandi’ conducted on the highway a couple of days before the D-Day citing terror alert made many panicky guzzlers stay away.The regular conduct of breath analyser test by the traffic police ensured discipline on motorcyclists, but had a toll on excise revenue. Similarly, the circular on extension of deadline from 10.30 pm to midnight was handed over to the outlets late evening on the day, and as a result the message could not reach the masses.“Fearing raids, our customers left by 9.45 pm”, a dhaba owner chipped in.
