The authors are too harsh and impractical in suggesting that certain sections of people — like those who own a refrigerator or an air conditioner — be excluded from LPG subsidies (“ >Widening the net beyond the income norm,” Jan.11). Even a lower middle-class household and some poor households these days are able to afford them.Moreover, a voluntary disclosure by people who own them is unlikely. The authors’ suggestion to consider ownership of an automobile as a criterion is more appropriate. Nevertheless, with only 3 per cent of India’s population coming under the ambit of the income tax and the number of tax assesses working out to about 3.5 crores, I am at a loss to understand as to why the government didn’t apply that for exclusion from subsidies.S.
