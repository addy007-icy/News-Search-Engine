Pope Francis has told members of the world’s wealthy political and economic elite that they should not be deaf to the cry of the poor and must consider their own role in creating inequality.New technologies such as robotics must also not be allowed to replace humans with “soulless machines”, he said in a message to the World Economic Forum in Davos.“To all of you I appeal once more: ‘Do not forget the poor’,” he said.The Pope, who wrote a major encyclical on climate change and protection of the environment last year, also urged business leaders to see to it that the planet does not become “an empty garden”.The annual Davos meeting brings together many of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful people to consider issues such as economics, climate change and war, with an eye to working on solutions to them.It has been criticised by anti-globalisation activists and others, however, as a forum for organisations that have been responsible for the problems in the first place.They are boosted by reports such as one from charity Oxfam estimating that 1 per cent of the world’s population owns 99 per cent of the wealth. Pope Francis, who has made the defence of the poor a hallmark of his papacy and has in the past called money “the dung of the devil”, said businesses and wealthy societies must acknowledge their role in creating poverty.“Weeping for other people’s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality,” he said in the text of a message read for him by a top Vatican cardinal on Wednesday.Message from Joe BidenSeparately, U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden criticised modern corporate “short-termism” on Wednesday and urged chief executives gathered in Davos to look after their workers as well as their shareholders.Relishing his nickname of “middle-class Joe”, he told delegates at the World Economic Forum annual meeting that the middle classes, the backbone of economies and democracies, now faced unprecedented threats from technological change.“My call to action here is simple – embrace your obligation to workers as well as your shareholders,” Mr. Biden said, criticising the recent trend by firms to return mountains of cash to investors by buying back stock rather than investing for the future. — Reuters
