To chatter, is for the anxious, to loosen up. As time ticked off, reminding, hastening his son's date with the coolly tough Spanish, Mr. Ramanathan set off on a recap of his son's tennis trail - tender yet eventful - to one of his friends, partly thankful and partly wishful. However hard one tries to rein it in, a display of emotional medley is but reflexively spontaneous for absorbed in the match wishful thinking often breaches self-restraint.This, even after one dismissively said, "I have no big expectations from him today. He's playing a seasoned campaigner and if he manages to push himself harder that's more than enough." As Ramkumar walked in, racquet drawn out and kit-bag in tow, pervading the air was the effusion from a crowd, sparsely scattered. Mr. Ramanathan shifted, sighed and muttered through a match that his son managed to make short work of. "We've been visiting (the Chennai Open) since he was 6-7 years old. There was a time when the top Indian tennis players indulged in a playful knock-up with the visiting kids on a specially set-up kids court. It so happened that he (Ramkumar) got an opportunity to play with Paes and Bhupathi who praised his potential. I have a paper-cutting of it," he had said, proudly pensive, before the match.As the 21-year old ground and volleyed, he nodded, in approval and satisfaction, for every point earned, was for him, a realization of his son's potential. One hour after the match unwound, >Ramkumar wrapped it, ribboned with a straight-set victory. Leaping off and applauding were his parents adding to the eruption. "I hoped that he should win, yes. But never expected it to be a bit easy," says his proud mother Alagammai Ramanathan, blushing.
