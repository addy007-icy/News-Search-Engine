Dharwad Yogakshema Samste president and the former MLA Chandrakant Bellad has demanded that the election commission conduct a detailed inquiry into the affidavits submitted by the candidates for elections as there is every possibility that candidates may misguide the commission by giving false information.He said that in recent times candidates contesting elections have started distributing money for getting votes. If the voters receive money for exercising their franchise, they would lose the right to question the mistakes of the leaders, so the election commission should conduct inquiry into candidatesâ€™ assets to stop distribution of money, he said. Since the zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections are scheduled for February, the parties should select candidates who can realise the gram swaraj dream of Mahatma Gandhi, he added.
