In view of recent security alert in the country following the terrorist attack at the Air Force base in Pathankot and upcoming Republic Day celebrations, Air India has advised its passengers to report at the airport counter three hours prior to the departure of their flights to avoid delayed departure of flights owing to these procedures. The security measures would include stringent checking of passengers and their baggage at airports. “Though the minimum reporting time for domestic flights is 75 minutes and for international flights it is 150 minutes before the scheduled departure of flights, it is advised that to avoid inconvenience, passengers may report three hours before the scheduled departure of flight,” Air India said in a statement.However, there will be no change in the closing time of check-in-counters and boarding gates. Currently, check-in counters for domestic flights close 45 minutes before scheduled time of departure and counters for international flights close 60 minutes prior to departure.Counters for both domestic and international flights operating from International Terminals close 60 minutes before scheduled departure of flight. Boarding gates in both cases close 25 minutes prior to departure, Air India said.
