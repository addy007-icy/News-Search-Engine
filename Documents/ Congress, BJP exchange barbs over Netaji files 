The declassification of files on Netaji triggered a war of words between the Congress and the ruling BJP.Accusing the Congress of sidelining prominent leaders of pre-Independence India and promoting one family, BJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma said the government’s move was to ensure that “respect” was given to the “ignored” freedom fighters.Senior party spokesperson and former Union Minister Anand Sharma said since the documents had been released in “bits and pieces” it suggested that the BJP government had launched “a mischievous political campaign.”Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said the motive seemed murky since it had triggered a “conflict” between different streams of ideology.
