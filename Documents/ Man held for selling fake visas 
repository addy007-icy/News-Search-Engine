The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) police have arrested a man who allegedly arranged fake visas for people who wished to work abroad. Prahlad Sharma targeted people from the rural belts with a promise to send them to Afghanistan.The 59-year-old and his associates would prepare fake visas and charge their customers huge amounts before sending them to Afghanistan via Dubai. The police claim that Sharma has sent many job aspirants to other countries through fraudulent means. In fact, he was booked for sending a Rajasthan resident to Afghanistan in 2012.While Sharma’s associate were nabbed by the airport police earlier, he had been absconding. A city court had declared him a proclaimed offender.Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGIA) D.K. Gupta said: “We chalked out a comprehensive and multipronged strategy to nab proclaimed offenders. We managed to nab three proclaimed offenders in the past fortnight,” said Mr. Gupta.
