As part of creating awareness on road safety, the police in the district head-quarters held a motor-cycle rally wearing helmets. They urged people to wear helmets while driving two-wheelers stating that it would save the diver’s life from critical head injuries if any accident takes place. “We have organised this programme to create awareness in the public on the importance of wearing helmet. Everyone should follow traffic rules and prevent accidents,” said M. Tiurapatanna, DSP, Sangareddy, who participated in the motor cycle rally.
