The Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association, the Tamil Nadu Rural Development Officers Association, and the Tamil Nadu Revenue Department Employees Association continued their strike for the second day on Tuesday and staged a demonstration at the Collectorate seeking dismissal of a person who works for the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA).Convenor of the joint action committee of the three associations for the district V. Senthil Kumar said that R. Naresh Kumar was appointed by the Project Director of the DRDA here about two-and-a-half-years ago for carrying out solid waste management works. He allegedly ill-treated department staff and officers working at panchayats, block development office and the district Collectorate.“He even threatened to get us sacked and was rude to us when we tried to intervene,” Mr. Senthil said and added that the staff and officials resumed work from afternoon on Tuesday after the district administration told them that steps have been taken to initiate appropriate action against the officer concerned.
