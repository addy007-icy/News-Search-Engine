Rajan Chellappa, Commissioner C. Kathiravan and engineers inspected West Masi Street and held consultation with the staff who were engaged in the UGD works.As the Meenakshi Temple’s important car festival would be conducted close to the Chitirai festival, the roads had to be spruced up before the event.With general elections fast approaching and model code of conduct likely to come into force anytime, officials had been told to get the works expedited and prepare the estimate for relaying roads in Masi Streets, Vadampoki Street, West Tower, and on Town Hall Road and Netaji Road.Ahead of all other political parties, the ruling AIADMK began its campaign with the functionaries organising door-to-door visits. Inaugurating the programme, Minister Sellur K. Raju and others participated in a rally at Jaihindpuram.The booth-level campaign members would distribute pamphlets describing the government’s achievements since 2011 to the public.Mr. Rajan Chellappa, who is also the district secretary, inaugurated a similar campaign from Iyer Bungalow junction.
