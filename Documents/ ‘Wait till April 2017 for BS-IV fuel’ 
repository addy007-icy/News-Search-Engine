The State will have to wait till April 2017 for fuel refilling stations to supply Bharat Stage-IV fuels, while Telangana and Karnataka will be implementing it this year, HPCL General Manager (Retail) G.S.V. Prasad has said.Mr. Prasad, who was here to participate in the Oil and Gas Conservation Fortnight – 2016 being organised in the State for the first time post-bifurcation, said that the upgrading of fuel from Bharat Stage - III to IV required the upgrading of oil refineries. The Centre had set a target of upgrading all petrol bunks from BS-III to BS-IV by April 2017, he added.Explaining the difference between regular and upgraded fuels Mr. Prasad said the concentration of sulphur in BS-III petrol was 150 parts per million (ppm), while in BS-IV, it was just 50 ppm. Similarly, sulphur in BS-III diesel is 350 ppm and BS-IV diesel, 50 ppm. Sulphur in the fuel is emitted as sulphur dioxide, causing acid rain, he said.“The upgrading of refineries for production of fuel with less sulphur content is quite expensive. The approximate cost of upgrading refineries in Telangana is between Rs. 5,000 crore and Rs. 6,000 crore,” Mr Prasad said.
