West Asia, already in turmoil, is now seeing escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran (“A dangerous escalation”, Jan. 6). Under the guise of protecting their own sects, both nations are resorting to violence, but the real motive is to establish their own hegemony. The Islamic State has carried out unimaginable atrocities on women and minority communities in the region. The execution of the Shia cleric by Saudi Arabia and the responses by protestors in Iran would only further exacerbate the cruelty of IS. It is important that both nations have amicable relations to solve the Syrian crisis.Gagan,Noida, Uttar Pradesh
