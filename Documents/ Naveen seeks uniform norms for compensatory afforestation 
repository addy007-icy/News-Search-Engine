Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi that special provisions made for Central PSUs in the matter of raising compensatory afforestation be also made applicable to State PSUs in order to expedite compensatory forest clearances for such development projects.In his two-page letter, Mr.Patnaik said that compensatory afforestation was required to be taken up over non-forest land in an equal extent in lieu of the forest land diverted for non-forest use according to guidelines under Para 3.2(i) of the Forest Conservation Act.However, a special dispensation has been allowed for the projects of the Central government and Central PSUs under Para 3.2(ix)(a) of the guidelines that allows raising of compensatory afforestation on degraded forest land on twice the extent of the areas diverted, Mr.Patnaik said.He said that in all other cases, including the projects of State governments and the State PSUs, use of degraded forest land for compensatory afforestation was permitted only if it was certified by the Chief Secretary of the State that suitable non-forest land was not available in the State.Mr.Patnaik said that in the Odisha perspective, where 37.34 per cent of the geographical area is recorded as forest area, difficulties were faced, especially by the State government and State PSUs, in identifying non-forest land of large extents for raising compensatory afforestation, particularly in districts having a large number of mining and industrial projects.Besides, it was also more desirable to take up compensatory afforestation in degraded forest land located in close proximity to the project area from the environmental as well as forest management point of view, rather than taking it up in faraway areas, Mr.Patnaik said in his letter.“In my view, it will be in the fitness of things to extend the special dispensation given to the Central government/PSU projects to the projects owned by the State government/PSUs also as the projects run by the State government/PSUs are as important as the projects of the Central government/PSUs for achieving the national developmental goals/objectives,” he said.The Chief Minister mentioned that the Chief Secretary of Odisha had already raised the issue with the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, but the Ministry had not agreed to the proposal.
