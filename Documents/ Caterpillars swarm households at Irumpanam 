The worms are also feeding on the tender leaves in the small vegetable farm grown in less than an acre.Pest outbreakMore than a crop health management programme, the issue needs to be tackled as a pest outbreak creating problems for the people in a large area, said Sheeba N.K. agriculture officer in-charge, Krishi Bhavan, Thiruvamkulam, who inspected the area.Principal Agriculture Officer, the district-level agriculture officer, is expected to visit the area on Tuesday, as a report has been sent to the higher authorities.The people had asked for a tractor to would clear the agricultural area of the thick growth.
