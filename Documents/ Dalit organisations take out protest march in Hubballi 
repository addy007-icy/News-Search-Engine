Seeking the arrest of those “responsible” for the suicide of research scholar at the University of Hyderabad, various Dalit organisations took out a protest march here on Thursday.During the protest march, members of the organisations also sought a ban on the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishat alleging that it was responsible for the suicide of the research scholar.The protest march began from the Ambedkar statue near the Head Post office and covered Lamington Road and Kittur Chennamma Circle, to reach the Mini Vidhana Soudha.Raising slogans against anti-Dalit leaders and officers of the university, the protesters sought the immediate arrest of Union Ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya terming them ant-Dalit.They condemned what they termed as attempts to keep Dalits away from higher education and from becoming followers of Ambedkar.At the Kittur Chennamma Circle, the protesters staged a demonstration for some time before going to the Mini Vidhana Soudha, where they submitted a memorandum addressed to the President. Office-bearers of various Dalit organisations, including Pitambrappa Bilar, Gurunath Ullikashi, Maruti Doddamani, Premanath Chikkatumbal and Vijay Guntral, led the protest march.In the memorandum, apart from seeking steps against Ms. Smriti Irani and Mr. Bandaru Dattatreya, the Dalit organisations have sought protection to Dalits from such institutionalised attacks.
