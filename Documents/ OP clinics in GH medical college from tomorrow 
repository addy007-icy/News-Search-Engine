The new Government Medical College set up on the General Hospital (GH) campus here will start its first outpatient (OP) units in General Surgery and General Medicine from Wednesday.The government has issued orders that OP clinics in Surgery and Medicine be run every Wednesday at the GH by the medical college faculty.It has asked the current team of doctors running these OP clinics in GH to work alongside the medical college faculty as a “composite team.”KGMOA threatHowever, even as the Director of Health Services and the Administrative Superintendent of GH issued circulars asking the Health Service doctors to cooperate with the medical college faculty in running the OP clinics, the decision has met with stiff resistance from the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA), who has threatened to stay away from all clinical services if the government went ahead with the decision.‘Create more posts’“We will not allow our OP services to be taken over on Wednesday. Let the government create enough posts and take over the entire Surgery and Medicine OPs. This once-a-week OP clinic is bound to create a lot of confusion and ego clashes in wards and affect patient care,” president of KGMOA Prameela Devi said.Different pay scalesClinical services by two streams of doctors – one under Health Services and the other under the Directorate of Medical Education – in a single institution, with different pay scales is not fair.The experiment has been tried out at the new medical colleges at Idukki and Manjeri also, where utter confusion prevails, she claimed.“It is a policy decision taken by the government to convert the GH into a medical college and we cannot go back on it now. It is a requirement of the Medical Council of India that clinical services be provided by a new medical college in four specialities – Surgery, Medicine, ObGyn and Paediatrics – in the first year,” K. Ellangovan, Secretary, Health said.For team work“We are not keeping GH doctors out of their institution but want them to work as a team with the medical college faculty. The Health Minister will be discussing the issue with KGMOA,” Mr. Ellangovan added.
