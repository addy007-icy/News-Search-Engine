C. Dase Gowda, chairman of the Command Area Development Authority (CADA), took the administrative officials of CADA to task for not paying salaries in the last six months to over 29 employees who were deputed from KEONICS to CADA.Mr. Gowda asked the officials to provide three months salary in a day or two and the remaining in a week’s time. “CADA was getting work done by the employees and it is the duty of CADA to pay their salaries on time,” he said and caution the officials of disciplinary action if they further delay the payment. However, CADA officials on the condition of anonymity said that KEONICS had failed to furnish the PF and other details of the employees and hence the delay. Mr. Gowda said that recruitment of staff had been stopped since many years and CADA was understaffed. Mr. Gowda said that he would meet Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in this regard and prevail upon him to recruit more staff.
