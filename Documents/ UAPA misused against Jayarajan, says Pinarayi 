CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan has defended the use of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) saying that such stringent laws are required to deal with terrorism as provisions in the Indian Penal Code are not sufficient to tackle terror-linked cases.‘Bid to appease RSS’However, replying to questions at a news conference here on Saturday, he maintained that on many occasions this law had been misused like the one registered against CPI(M)’s Kannur district secretary P. Jayarajan in the Kathirur Manoj murder case. This was done by the Congress-led United Democratic Front government to appease the RSS.The intention behind misusing the provisions of the UAPA should be examined. One of the reasons cited was that bombs had been used in the murder. Was this the first instance when bombs had been used, he asked.Mr. Vijayan also said that UAPA should be invoked in incidents like the chopping of the palm of a professor at Thodupuzha.That was a conspiracy and there was a necessity to rightfully use the UAPA, he added.‘No hostility’To another question, he said the CPI(M) had not forged any unholy alliance with Islamist groups to emerge victorious in the recent local body polls. The party had no hostilities with any Muslim sects including the Sunni group led by Kanthapuram Aboobacker Musaliyar.However, the CPI(M) was against the fundamentalist outfits like the Social Democratic Party of India, which was earlier known as the National Development Front.
