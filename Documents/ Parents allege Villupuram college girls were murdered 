A day after three girls of the SVS College of Naturopathy and Yoga Science at Bangaram in Villupuram were >found dead in a well near the institution, revenue officials sealed the college and picked up the son of the college’s administrator, a lecturer, and two hostel wardens for questioning.The parents of the girls suspected foul play and expressed the fear that the students were killed and their bodies dumped in the well as they had confronted the management about monetary exploitation some months ago. They demanded that the post-mortem be conducted in Chennai. Police have registered a case under IPC Sections 384 (extortion) and 306 (abetment to suicide) and provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment Act.“The handwriting in the suicide note claimed to have been recovered by the police is not that of my daughter’s. It is a fake letter created to save the management,” alleged Tamilarasan, father of Monisha, one of the girls who died. “Her body bore injuries on the head,” he added.
