Over 500 schools have decided to introduce Sanskrit as an additional subject from classes one to nine. The schools have sought the help of Samskritha Bharathi, an organisation involved in propagating and promoting the language.Srinivasan, chief of the organisation, and B.S. Parvatharaju, former principal of Marimallappa PU College, said that schools belonging to various religious mutts had shown great enthusiasm in introducing the language in their institutions. A private school in Saraswathipuram had already introduced the language a year ago, they said. Over 6,000 students are learning Sanskrit at the institution run by Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuruu, Mr. Srinivasan said.He also said that people from foreign countries had began learning the language and he noted that over 14 of the top universities in Germany taught Sanskrit.
