The two-day summit is being hosted by the Visakhapatnam Port Trust organised by Gateway Media in association with Visakha Container Terminal Private Limited and major ports on the East Coast, executive director Maritime Gateway R.Ramaprasad told a media conference he addressed along with Deputy Chairman VPT P.L. Haranadh and vice president VCTPL Anil Narayanan here on Wednesday.The fourth edition of ECMBS has attracted more port users, delegates from Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar are scheduled to participate. Coming in the backdrop of the Union Government’s Act East Policy and policies that are encouraging coastal shipping and inland waterways are sure to provide a boost to the maritime sector, especially in the East Coast. In the state, the port-led development policy of the State government is set to promote maritime sector here, Mr Ramprasad said.The theme of the conference is ‘East Coast Hinterland: Waiting to be Served’. Around 350 delegates from different verticals would be participating in this conference to discuss the manufacturing and industrial growth on the east coast, critical challenges of cargo evacuation, current and future infrastructure at ports and terminals.The modernisation taken up by the VPT along with the implementation of recommendations of the Boston Consulting Group on removing bottlenecks has improved the efficiency of the Port.The modernisation, capacity augmentation and improved efficiencies have helped the VPT cope with the loss in cargo handling due to fall in demand for iron ore and coal, the VPT Deputy Chairman said.The expansion of quay length to 450 metres and dredging have enabled 320 m cargo vessels to berth at the VCTPL and increased the handling capacity of the port. The Port is working on increasing its container handling to 1 million TEUs in next three years, Mr Haranadh said. The VCTPL is also setting up a container freight station. The doubling and electrification of Rayagada Vizianagaram line that is being taken up on a war-footing would improve the evacuation from the Port and improve access to the hinterland, he added.The two-day meet will begin on January 28
