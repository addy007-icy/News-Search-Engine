At least 15 per cent of the road accidents reported in the city was caused by autorickshaws, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (traffic) A.G. Babu here on Saturday.Addressing auto drivers to mark the Road Safety Week being observed, he said that auto drivers should avoid overloading, drunk driving and obey traffic rules.By taking over and above the permitted number of passengers, the risk was not only for the vehicle, but also passengers and other motorists using roads. Hence, the drivers should avoid such practices in public interest.Mr. Babu also said that every year over 1.5 lakh persons died in road accidents across the country, according to data. In many cases, the victims were identified as men than women. In our country, men were considered the head of a family. Thus, in the case of death, the families suffered a lot and the vacuum could never be filled. Avoidable accidents not only saved lives, but also ensured that they reached homes safely.In the case of suicides or murders, there may be more than one reason for committing such an offence, while in road accidents, due to the rash and negligent driving, unsuspecting people were killed. Hence, motorists should take note of the consequences of negligence, Mr. Babu said.Auto drivers, numbering over 100, took a pledge on the occasion at the Simakkal roundabout on safe driving and obeying traffic rules.
