The Kerala Brahmana Sabha, representing sizeable Tamil Brahmin population in the State, has said it will stand for status quo with regard to temple affairs in Sabarimala, as the community believes in preserving age-old customs and traditions.In a statement here on Tuesday, sabha president Karimpuzha Raman said the restriction on entry of young women to Sabarimala had been in existence for centuries and that was even aimed at ensuring women’s safety. “The practice of restricting women’s entry to Sabarimala forms a part of a tradition. Any forced change in traditions will hurt the sentiments of devotees.“There are many things which remain vital outside the law books. We hope the courts will consider this aspect while delivering its verdict,” he said.Mr. Raman said a resolution in this regard had been passed and it would be the duty of government to protect the customs and traditions of each community intact.
