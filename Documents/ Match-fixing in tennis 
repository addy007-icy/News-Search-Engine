It is shocking to note that allegations of match-fixing have now come to haunt the sport of tennis (‘Sport’ – “Was it a fix?” Jan.26). An investigation by a prominent media house in the West shows that 16 of the top-50 players, including Grand Slam champions, have been reported for losing games. Although top-ranked players and tennis governing bodies have rejected these claims (‘Sport’ – “Black Monday as corruption casts its shadow again”, Jan.19), there is now a perception that match-fixing is a part of world tennis due to the big money involved. Novak Djokovic’s initial admission that “he was offered $200,000 to throw a match in 2007” only adds credence to the suspicion of corruption. Tennis is a game that fully depends on the proficiency of an individual. Therefore, it is painful to see that the sanctity of this graceful sport too has been besmirched.R. Sivakumar,ChennaiAllegations of match-fixing in tennis show that most sporting events face the danger of collapse due to fixing. Allegations of fixing are killing the essence of sports. Right from the ‘ping-pong diplomacy’ of 1971 when the U.S. table tennis team was invited by the People’s Republic of China, in an attempt to build closer diplomatic relations, to India-Pakistan cricket diplomacy, sport is the common factor which binds nations together. People losing faith in sporting events will have serious and negative implications. Hence, the need of the hour is to instil fear among sports players by passing stricter anti-fixing laws.Siddhesh Sawant,Mumbai“Fixing fever” seems to be affecting tennis too, giving the much respected game a bad name. As money matters in all forms of sport, fixing matches and games will ensure that easy money can be earned without shedding a drop of sweat on a court or field. Now it is time to have an anti-corruption unit in tennis as well.C.K. Subramaniam,Navi Mumbai
