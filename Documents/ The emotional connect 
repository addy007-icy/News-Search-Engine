The lively rendering of ‘Pahi Pahi Bala Ganapathy’ in raga Hamsadhwani by the vocalist almost aroused rasikas from their post-lunch slump, as dancer Shirisha Shashank, clad in a beautiful blue green costume, made a grand entry invoking the blessings of the remover of all obstacles.The younger brother Muruga was the hero of the following song ‘Swamiyai Vara Solladi’, the Purvikalyani varnam, a composition of Dandayudhapani Pillai. The song depicts the nayika cajoling her sakhi to fetch her lord, but when she realises the friend is unaware of her lord, describes the magnificence of His form and traits, which were depicted through detailed sancharis by Shirisha.Her maturity and artistry shone through in the concluding sequence, where Shirisha’s fleeting expressions could capture the changing moods. The jathi korvais set to varied talas, each set composed by a different musician, sparkled with speed and grace. The peacock, kavadi and vel motifs were incorporated into the korvais through interesting choreographic patterns.Shirisha’s portrayal of the mugdha nayika — full of innocence, taunted and teased for being friendly with the hero was marked by lovely moments while in the ashtapadi ‘Sakhi he’ (Suddha Sarang) she beautifully conveyed the delicate overtones of sringara. There was clarity in footwork and the abhinaya nuanced, but the dancer needs to gain more confidence and a distinctive style. Preeti Mahesh provided vocal support, with Balakrishnan on nattuvangam, Ramakrishnan on mridangam and Rijesh on violin.
