The analysis of the Supreme Court verdict upholding Kerala’s policy of ‘prohibition’ will only pave the way for the brewing of illicit liquor and its clandestine sale in the black market (“All in the spirit of equality”, Jan.4). How the officials in the State government are going to address this issue is a million-dollar question.E.S. Chandrasekaran,ChennaiIf the writer’s line of reasoning has to be accepted, then there cannot be any exception to the law on prohibition and there will have to be the necessity of roping in five-star hotels. Otherwise there could be a violation of Article 14. Is the writer trying to romanticise equality under the name of the Constitution? It is a peoples’ document and the Preamble also begins with the phrase, “we the people of India”. Therefore, the Supreme Court’s verdict which upholds a law (and which tries to save families from facing ruin) cannot be faulted merely on the ground that five-star hotels have been exempted. The court has only ensured justice to the common man.N.G.R. Prasad,Chennai
