The Delhi government and an association representing the radio taxi operators have accused the mobile app-based cab services like Ola and Uber of charging the passengers in excess of the rates prescribed under the law.The allegation was made before a Bench of Justice Manmohan in Delhi High Court on Friday during the hearing on a petition filed by the Association of Radio Taxis alleging that the app-based cabs were not complying with the Court’s previous orders.The Court asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit stating how app-based taxi services were overcharging the people. The government counsel orally alleged that these cabs were charging very high rates and were not mentioning the distance travelled on the receipts issued to passengers.The Court posted the matter for further hearing on March 15, after the government counsel said the issue could be resolved by the cab companies themselves. The Association of Radio Taxis said the failure of app-based cab companies to fully comply with the Court order on plying of diesel cabs here had disrupted the level playing field.The High Court had on October 14, 2015, allowed app-based cab companies to ply diesel-run taxis for point-to-point service in the Capital till March 1, 2016, by when they will have to completely shift to the compressed natural gas (CNG). The Court had made it clear that cab firms, which did not give an undertaking for phasing out of their diesel taxis from the city roads, will have to strictly comply with its July 2015 order, by which the Delhi government’s January 1, 2015, order on amended radio taxi scheme of 2006 was upheld.Uber had earlier told the Court that it had started phasing out diesel cabs and would completely phase them out by March 1, 2016. A similar statement was made by Taxi For Sure, a subsidiary of Ola. On the other hand, Ola had said it had already phased out diesel cabs and was using only CNG-run taxis for point-to-point service in the Capital.These cabs allegedly charge very high rates, fail to mention distance travelled on receipts issued to passengers
