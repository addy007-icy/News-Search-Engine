Actor R. Madhavan, whose performance in the 1990s TV shows Sea Hawks and Banegi Apni Baat were highly appreciated, says he will only consider doing another show on the small screen now if the money is good.“I can think of doing TV shows if the money is good. A film star is a film star, and you can’t take that away. Hence, I don’t think about money when I do films, but I will do it for TV like the way I do it for endorsements,” Madhavan said.
