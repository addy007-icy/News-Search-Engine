With growth of population and proliferation of multi-storey apartments, residents of Ayappakam, near Ambattur, believe their area has to have a separate police station. Currently, they go to Thirumullaivoyal police station, around 8 km away, for filing a complaint. Ayapakkam comes within the limits of Thirumullaivoyal police station, which also includes Thirumullaivoyal and Annanoor. The station caters to the needs of around 2.5 lakh people.Sandwiched between Ambattur Industrial Estate and Thiruverkadu, Ayapakkam developed as a residential area, since 1990, after Tamil Nadu Housing Board quarters came up. Unlike Ambattur that houses more industrial units, Ayapakkam is predominantly a residential area and it connects with the city, via Anna Nagar and Maduravoyal, through Poonamallee High Road and Chennai-Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road. After a new building was constructed in 2014, the Thirumulliavoyal police station was relocated further away near Avadi on CTH Road. “With poor bus connectivity, residents must go to Ambattur to reach the police station in case of emergencies,” said S. Dhanya, a resident of Ayapakkam.The Ambattur police district includes police stations at Ambattur, Ambattur Estate, Korattur, Thiruverkadu, Avadi, Muthuapudupet, Pattabiram, Thirumullaivoyal, Poonamalee, Kundrathur, Mangadu, SRMC (Sri Ramachandra Medical College) and Nasarathpet. “We will consider the request of having a separate police station in Ayapakkam,” said a police officer.
