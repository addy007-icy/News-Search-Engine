Moody’s Investors Service’s Sovereign Risk Group Associate Managing Director Atsi Sheth was in India last week. She spoke to The Hindu on a host of issues including why the sovereign rating for the world’s fastest-growing major economy, India, remains at the lowest investment grade, just above junk status.What do you make of the latest industrial growth figure of (-) 3.2% in November?In India’s case, high frequency indicators tend to be fairly volatile so it is advisable not to draw broad conclusions from a month’s data. Having said that, if you look at the trend in the IIP (Index of Industrial Production) over the last several months, it is clear that output growth recovery is weak. In our view, given the correlation in manufacturing between India and the world, at least part of this weakness is a reflection of global factors as also reflected in merchandise export data.India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. What factors have held back India’s sovereign rating within the Baa range?Three things. First, Indian infrastructure — unless significantly upgraded — is likely to pose constraints on India’s growth over the medium term. Second, Indian banks will be unable to support growth acceleration unless balance sheet and profitability ratios improve. Third, India’s macro-economic indicators — that is, inflation and fiscal metrics — have generally been weaker than Baa-rated peers. Although inflation has declined, it still faces risks from supply side constraints in agriculture. And meeting fiscal deficit targets has been challenging in an environment of subdued corporate profitability, which results in subdued tax revenue growth. Now, we are seeing policy efforts at various levels to address all three issues. And this is why we have a positive outlook on India’s Baa3 rating. However, the success of these policy efforts — and an improvement in measurable metrics — will depend on how policy-makers are able to navigate domestic political challenges as well as global growth and financial headwinds in 2016.How closely will you be watching the coming budget? It is being said that it is going to be a crucial budget for the government. Why and how?Every budget is important from our point of view. But frankly, India’s fiscal consolidation efforts are a process, not an event. So, in addition to watching announcements on February 29 this year, we will continue to monitor as usual the fiscal trends over the course of the year. We maintain our view that given India’s relatively low tax revenue base and relative rigidity in fiscal expenditures it is unlikely that India’s fiscal metrics will improve to the median levels of Baa-rated peers. On the other hand, thanks to a healthy private sector savings rate as well as requirements for banks to hold a certain portion of deposits in government securities, India’s government enjoys a very favourable financing profile compared to many peers. It is this favourable financing profile that allows the Indian government to sustain relatively high fiscal deficits and government debt. And India’s high nominal growth has allowed government debt-to-GDP ratios to decline even though fiscal deficits have remained high. However, in the current environment of subdued nominal growth, maintaining the downward trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio will require more active efforts to bring down the primary deficit.There are suggestions that the Union Government should go for another pause on the fiscal deficit consolidation path targets in order to create room for greater public investments. Would you say that will be good or bad for India’s growth? Will it be good or bad for India’s ratings?Whether additional fiscal spending is good or bad for India’s growth will depend on whether it is effectively directed toward creating supply (or reducing supply constraints) without fuelling inflationary pressures. Again, this is something that won’t be determined on February 29th but will only be clear over the rest of the year. From a ratings perspective, the expectation underpinning the positive outlook on India’s rating is that the fiscal consolidation trend that has been underway for a few years now will continue despite headwinds from global growth. While we are not focused on a shift in the fiscal deficit target by a few basis points, we do anticipate that the government will target lower fiscal deficits every year than in the previous year. This has been the case for a few years now.Food inflation has spiked again. Would you say the government needs to support the Reserve Bank of India in fighting inflation since monetary policy is blunt against food inflation?We’ve published research in the past that underscored India’s macro-economic vulnerability to drought. And we’ve noted that supply side constraints—relating to agricultural productivity and food distribution—have exacerbated this vulnerability. Until agricultural output — and hence food inflation — becomes less vulnerable to drought, monetary policy will remain constrained by food inflation.Remember that although monetary policy tightening cannot reduce food inflation, it does address the knock-on effect that food inflation has on wage inflation and inflation expectations.Real GDP growth in the first six months of this financial year has slowed compared to the corresponding period last year. What are the reasons?Several reasons for the slow recovery: the inability of banks to support credit growth given their weak balance sheets, the relatively recent monetary policy loosening (early 2015) which hadn’t fed through the system in the first half of this year, slower global trade and volatility in international capital inflows.When will growth pick up?When the above conditions are addressed. In our view, global conditions will not provide significant support to India’s domestic growth this year.So, if growth accelerates, it is most likely to do so because of improvements in the domestic demand and supply outlook.What are the three or four main things you believe would help India to achieve higher growth?The constraints on India’s growth are weak infrastructure, a vulnerability to inflation, regulatory complexity and policy uncertainty. If these are addressed, the growth outlook would improve.
