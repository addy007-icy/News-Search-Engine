Governor P. Sathasivam has cautioned news media against prejudices coming in the way of their sacred duty to provide objective information to the people. “Facts and information are sacred and must be portrayed as objectively as possible. However, today, many newspapers and channels have highly prejudiced headlines, with facts and essential background taking a backseat. This was a trend for a thriving democracy like ours, Mr. Sathasivam said after presenting the V.K. Madhavan Kutty-Keraleeyam media awards here on Tuesday. “Objective and impartial broadcasting of news is an indispensible tool, and one of the cornerstones of a democratic dispensation. The journalists and the media body as a whole have an inherent command and from their profession to be a responsible journalist, be it in any form. To be able to do so, adherence to certain norms of ethics is paramount. It is the responsibility of every individual associated with the media to act prudently with a sense of duty towards society and the nation. The duty is not simply to bring people the news. Their work must signify a belief in a principle, exhorted by democracy and made concrete in every form of publication,” he said. The awards were presented to Vidhu Vincent, Special Correspondent, MediaOne (electronic media) and O. Radhika, Sub Editor, Mathrubhumi (print media) and Biju Pankaj, Special Correspondent, Asianet News (special mention/electronic media). — Special Correspondent
