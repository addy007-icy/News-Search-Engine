Liver harvested from a brain dead person is a better choice for transplant than a live liver since it has some advantages, noted liver transplant surgeon Tom Cherian has said on the occasion of Care Hospitals completing 10 such surgeries.“Full organ is available for transplant from a cadaver donor. If a patient has to wait for a cadaver liver donation for four to six months, he or she can do it safely,” Dr. Cherian said.There is no additional advantage with the liver donated by a live donor.Most of the liver transplants are done with liver donated by live donors in areas like Delhi because cadaver liver donation is not available.“In Andhra Pradesh, thanks to the Jeevan Daan programme going to the people well and motivating them to donate organs of their brain dead family members, more cadaver liver transplants are taking place,” Dr. Cherian said. “Care Hospitals performed the highest such transplants in AP. The hospital has the equipment, efficient surgeons, and doctors who take care of the crucial post-operation phase,” he said.
