BJP State president Kummanam Rajasekharan has flayed Chief Minister Oommen Chandy for ridiculing the RSS and the CPI(M) plan to hold talks to end political violence in the State.Addressing a meet-the-press programme here on Tuesday, Mr. Rajasekharan said Mr. Chandy’s comment terming the proposed talks as fake was unbecoming of a Chief Minister.As a Chief Minister of a State he should not only strive for peace but also welcome if hostile political parties or organisations came forward to end violence.RSS Sarsanghachalak Mohan Bhagwat during his visit to the State last week had offered to hold talk with the CPI(M) to end political violence in Kannur and subsequently CPI (M) Polit Bureau member Pinarayi Vijayan had welcomed the proposal.Mr. Rajasekharan said that the successive governments run by both the UDF and the LDF had engaged only in negativity and politicking, but failed to address the needs of society. Their governments had no idea to utilise the natural resources and manpower to the State’s advantages. However, the BJP would change this perception by bringing out a vision document for the overall development of the State, he said.Replying to questions, Mr. Rajasekharan said that the BJP had not retracted its declared stand on seeking a CBI probe into the larger conspiracy in the Marad massacre of May 2003. The present UDF government had never requested the Centre for a CBI probe. However, a petition was still pending before the Supreme Court, he added.He also came down heavily on KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran for criticising JSS leader Rajan Babu , a lawyer who bailed out SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan in a case registered against him relating to inciting communal passion.
