: Flight operations were paralysed for nearly six hours on Friday morning after Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) witnessed the season’s worst spell of dense fog.More than 350 flights were affected after visibility at the airport dropped to nearly zero. Ten flights got diverted and 22 flights were cancelled. Hapless passengers had to spend three to five hours sitting inside aircraft as pilots waited for the fog to lift.“It was a nightmarish experience for us,” said Romshri Ashesh, a passenger who had to take a flight from Delhi to Raipur. “The scheduled departure was at 6 am and I left my house at 3 am to reach the airport on time. The boarding started on time but then due to fog, we had to sit inside the aircraft till 10 am,” she said.Ms. Ashesh decided to de-board and cancel her booking.“When the airline knew that the visibility was poor, they should have informed us in time and we could have reached the airport later. They didn’t offer us any food also, as we sat in the aircraft for nearly four hours,” she said.“Friday saw this season's worst fog and formed despite rather warm minimum temperature of 13 degrees Celsius. This was among the worst dense fog days at IGIA ,” said Dr. R.K. Jenamani, Director-in-Charge, IGIA met unit.
