Ten people, two women among them, sustained injuries when a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus collided with another at Outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala on Monday morning.Three among those, including one of the drivers, are said to be critical, said the police. The accident took place at Kairala through which the bus plying between Uttam Nagar and Bawana (Route Number 972) was plying.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Vikramjit Singh said the matter was reported to the police where the caller said that an air-conditioned low floor bus had collided with a chartered bus as it proceeded from Rithala Chowk towards Kanjhawala.Only one of the two carriageways of the road on which the accident happened was functional while the other was dug up by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for one of its projects. As a result, the traffic coming from both directions, as it was in the case of the two vehicles involved, was plying on the same road.“In a bid to overtake another vehicle, the driver of the chartered bus Mulai Ram sped and lost control hitting the DTC bus head on,” said Mr. Singh.While there was no one in the chartered bus barring the driver, the DTC bus had 30 passengers in it.The collision left many passengers and both the drivers injured.The 10 injured were taken to Valmiki Hospital and Sanjay Gandhi Hospital by locals and CATS ambulances.Six of them sustained minor injuries and were discharged after basic first aid, three remain critical.The list of critically injured includes Mulai Ram as well as Rajvir and Sultan Singh, the driver and conductor of the DTC bus respectively.Mulai Ram has been booked for rash and negligent driving as well as other relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code.Initial probe has revealed that the foggy conditions had also reduced visibility on the road.The driver of a chartered bus sped and lost control, hitting a DTC bus head on
