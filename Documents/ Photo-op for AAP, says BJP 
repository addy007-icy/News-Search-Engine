The BJP on Monday said the AAP government is using the odd-even scheme as a “photo-op” and slammed the party for not putting in place any feedback mechanism for the public.Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Vijender Gupta, demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, his Ministers and senior functionaries “should give up indulgence in photo–ops”. “The AAP government and its ministers are busy in their own publicity with regard to the personal sacrifices in the implementation of the odd-even scheme. They should instead start seriously coordinating and implementing the scheme because of the difficulties and inconvenience faced by the public,” he said.“The inadequacy of checking teams and volunteers as well as misbehaviour and overcharging of auto drivers reflected the poor administration of the government,” Mr. Gupta said. The Rohini MLA demanded that government should develop a feedback system with regard to citizens’ problems and inconvenience.
