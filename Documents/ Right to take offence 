As rightly suggested in the editorial (“Freedoms only for the outraged,” Jan.18), there is an urgent need to amend Section 295 (A) of the Indian Penal Code whose abuse has had a chilling effect on the fundamental right of free speech and expression guaranteed in our Constitution. Unless one’s speech or expression constitutes a cognisable and deliberate threat to communal harmony and peace, no citizen should be deprived of his or her liberty. There was a time when our leaders encouraged criticism. Our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, despite being lampooned by cartoonists, maintained his sense of humour. Unfortunately, today we have the strange case of a comedian being hauled over the coals for doing comedy. The cases against eminent personalities like M.F. Husain, rationalist Sanal Edamaruku and Tamil author Perumal Murugan over ‘hurt sentiments’ show the abuse of Section 295 (A). It is time our legislators took expeditious action to bring an amendment.K. Natarajan,Thanjavur
