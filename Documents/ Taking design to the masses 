It could be roads, gardens or even government office buildings. With better design, these places can be improved to be more efficient and user-friendly.The Institute of Indian Interior Designers (IIID) plans to take up such projects through its local chapters, says Pratap Jadhav, the institute’s president.“Taking Design to the Masses” is the theme of IIID for the next two years.Its members will work towards design intervention in public places, he says. It could be making roads walkable or improving post offices or water bodies. Some of the local chapters of the institute have already taken up such projects. “Design is a lifestyle and every individual has the right to it. We are also preparing modules of affordable designs,” he adds.In India, buildings have always been green as sustainability is part of life. However, space management and space saving needs more focus, especially in the metro cities. Youngsters still use Indian art and craft in buildings. “The sensitivity should be there for the buildings to remain green.” The institute is also having tie-ups with educational institutes for skill development and to have guest lectures on interior design. The focus on design is higher in the metro cities. But, awareness is gradually expanding to villages too, he said.M. SOUNDARIYA PREETHA
