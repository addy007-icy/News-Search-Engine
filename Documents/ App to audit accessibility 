To find out if the polling stations for the upcoming State elections are accessible to those with disabilities, the Disability Rights Alliance, Tamil Nadu (DRA) has developed an app that volunteers can use to audit the stations.The app, to be called ‘Election Audit’, has been developed by software company Ardhika, and will be available on the Android platform, but can only be used by registered volunteers, said Sathya Madurantakam of DRA.“We have to ensure the information we gather is authentic, and we are planning to give volunteers an orientation on how to use the app,” he said.A series of questions forms the basis of the app, said Smitha Sadasivan, a member of the DRA. “Each question has features listed under it – whether the road the polling station is on, is accessible, has lighting, ramps, toilets, seating areas, hand rail and grab bars, space for wheelchairs etc. If a particular feature is missing at the station, the volunteer can take a photograph and attach it,” she said.“The goal is to perhaps link it with the server at the office of the chief electoral officer. If this does not happen, we will deploy it on our server, gather the data and then give it to the CEO’s office,” said Mr. Madurantakam.
