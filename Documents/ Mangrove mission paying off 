Efforts of the district administration to protect mangrove vegetation in the district are yielding results with some of the owners of mangrove areas in private holding have come forward to hand over their plots.The ‘Mission Mangrove Kannur,’ started in June last year as an initiative to survey the entire extent of mangrove areas in the district to demarcate and notify to be conserved, has started to draw positive response from the owners of private mangrove areas.The mission envisages conservation of mangroves in government lands and those in areas in private possession.District Collector P. Bala Kiran told The Hindu that the mission had already secured 600 acres of mangrove areas as reserve forest and now got the consent owners of 43 acres in private possession.He said that the land would be purchased through negotiation.Mr. Kiran said that the tentative value of mangrove areas to be purchased from private owners was Rs.2.5 lakh per acre. The resources at his disposal could purchase 120 acres. But it would require an estimated Rs.30 crore for the purchase of the entire mangroves areas in private possession. He said he had submitted a proposal in this regard to the Central government through the State government.The survey held under the mission identified 1,873 acres of mangroves, which included private holdings. Forest Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishan had formally inaugurated the mission on November 24 by declaring 100 acres of mangrove area as reserve forest. Since then 500 acres more have been declared as reserve forest. The mission proposal envisages the purchase of the mangrove areas from private owners.
