It perhaps has to do with his advertising background, but R Balki’s movies are based on an inventive, out-of-the-box idea. While his first movie Cheeni Kum was about a 64-year-old man and 32-year-old woman falling in love with each other, his last release Shamitabh was about the coming together of a deaf and mute actor and an old, eccentric voice artist to create a singular movie star persona. Balki’s latest, the curiously named, Ki and Ka , is no exception.We know that it is about gender role reversal, ever since the story of Kareena Kapoor playing the corporate professional and Arjun Kapoor playing a house-husband got out in the media. But it was the release of the film’s poster last week that revealed that Ki and Ka delves into the gender divisions in the Hindi language. The poster shows Kareena lovingly tying a mangalsutra around her husband Arjun’s neck, while the two Hindi words streeling (feminine) and pulling (masculine) dissolve into each other to form ‘same thing’ as Ilaiyaraaja’s catchy score plays in the background.Keeping with its jocular tone, the rom-com will release on April 1, All Fools’ Day. “ Ki & Ka is a light film on the age old assumptions of male and female roles of in our society,” says Balki.“The Hindi language has genders for even objects. So the film is a fun take on the foolish conditioning of our minds.”
