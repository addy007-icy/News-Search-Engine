Jaffar Sait, who sought to quash the proceedings pending against him over allotment of a Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) plot in his wife’s name in Tiruvanmiyur.Mr. Sait submitted that the DVAC had registered a case against him and his family members among others under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Indian Penal Code, following which he was placed under suspension.
