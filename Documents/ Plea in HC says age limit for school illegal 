: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the response of the AAP government on a three-year-old child’s plea challenging its order fixing an upper-age limit for admission to entry-level classes in private unaided schools with the maximum age for nursery being set at four years.Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notice to the Delhi government and its education department seeking their stand on the plea, which said the December 18, 2015 order seeks to do “disservice to children and society by taking away their Right to Education by introducing an age limit for admission to a school”.The minor sought quashing of Delhi government’s decision, saying in case the government is allowed to execute the “illegal and arbitrary order” which is in “contravention of the mandatory provisions of law”, he shall suffer “irreparable harm and injury which cannot be compensated”.The minor, through his counsel, said that he be allowed to apply for pre-school for the academic year 2017-18.As per the notification issued in December 2015 by the Directorate of Education, the upper age limits for admission in pre-school, pre-primary and class-I has been prescribed as four years, five years and six years respectively as on March 31 of the year in which admission is being sought.The boy in his plea said that grant of only one year to seek admission to a school violates child’s rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution. —PTI
