The Delhi government kept its promise of providing adequate number of public transport buses on Delhi's roads to help commuters cope with the odd-even car rationing plan. Most of these buses, many loaned or leased from school bus contractors, however, ran empty during the morning hours.The DTC has a fleet of around 5,500 buses and the Delhi government augmented bus services by adding a fleet of 3,000 private contract carriage buses on the roads on Friday. Buses of all shapes and sizes and hues were out on Friday, running on different DTC route numbers. These buses were provided with special stickers by DTC which showed the route number and originating and terminating stops. The buses were rechristened 'Delhi Paryavaran Sewa' (Delhi Environment Service) on the stickers, specially for the odd-even plan days.There were, however, few takers for these services even as feeder services of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) ran almost full. “I have to go to my office in Nehru Place and even though buses on route number 375, that goes to Nehru Place, are aplenty today, I still prefer taking the Metro to office and that is why I boarded a feeder bus going to Anand Vihar,” said Ashish Malhotra, a resident of Dilshad Colony.But there seemed to be a paucity of DTC buses on Friday.Twenty-five-year-old Suresh Sharma, who commutes by bus, said that the frequency of DTC buses did not appear to have increased on Friday.“Most buses are plying quite empty, but that is probably since it was a holiday. I've been waiting for two buses and both haven't come. Hopefully this will not happen on Monday when the crowd will be more,” he said, while waiting a bus stop in Munirka.Another bus commuter, Pinky Mirchandi, said the number of cars on the streets appeared to have reduced. “I hope it works in the long-term,” said the 23-year-old.“It is good to see that school buses are doubling up as public transport vehicles on the city's roads and it would be great if the Delh government could continue the arrangement even when the odd-even plan is not in force,” said Vatsalya Sharma, a resident of Jhilmil. “As school buses only ply early in the morning and afternoon, these can easily be deployed in the day and in the evening office hours,” he said.With inputs from Kaushik Swaminathan (an intern with The Hindu)DTC had augmented its services by adding 3,000 private contract buses
