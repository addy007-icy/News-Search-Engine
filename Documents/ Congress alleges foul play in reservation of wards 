Hundreds of the Congress party workers led by former minister B. Saraiah and DCC president N. Rajender Reddy staged a demonstration at the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation office demanding revision of reservation of wards by the State government.They alleged that data was distorted and wards were reserved so as to benefit the ruling party rather doing the same rationally. They said they would move the Court if the government failed to revise the reservations before the ensuing elections to the local body.Mr. Saraiah said the ruling party leaders were known for manipulations and they were turning every chance in their favour only to gain political mileage.“The State government is adopting anti-democratic means only to win the elections and doing nothing. Event the elections are being manipulated in their favour and people will teach a lesson to the TRS party in forthcoming elections,” he said.Mr. Rajender Reddy strongly objected to the reservation of wards and said neither the actual data nor the opinion of opposition parties were considered in finalising the reservations.Town Congress president T. Vidyasagar, Hari Rama Devi and other senior leaders were present.
