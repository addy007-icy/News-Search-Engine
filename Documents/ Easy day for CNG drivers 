: Vimlesh Kumar (39), a resident of Vaishali in Ghaziabad, has been trying to sell his old Maruti Zen, retrofitted with a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) kit for a while and settle for a more expensive petrol-run sedan. On Friday, he was thanking his stars that he hadn’t sold off the car.“Due to my work, I have to visit quite a few places in the day even though my office is in Delhi. If not for my old car, I don’t know how I would have managed,” said Mr. Kumar, a marketing professional. “I have been planning to sell this one and buy a more expensive petrol-run car for and have been saving-money too. Thankfully, I still have my CNG run car and I don't have to worry if the day is even or odd,” he said.For the nearly five lakh owners of CNG-run vehicles in Delhi and the NCR or at least those who ventured out in Delhi on Friday, it was smooth sailing with no worries of being stopped or penalised.The Delhi government has kept CNG-run vehicles out of the ambit of the car-rationing scheme, though they do have to get stickers, issued by the Indraprastha Gas Ltd. (IGL), pasted on their front windscreens.On Friday, the Delhi Traffic Police were allowing vehicles with stickers a free run but even those without these stickers were let off. “We have stopped many even-numbered cars since morning, which turned out to be fitted with CNG kits. As the owners of these vehicles said that they were yet to get stickers, we let them go by asking them to get the stickers pasted on their cars as soon as possible,” said a Traffic policeman deployed at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh Apsara border.
