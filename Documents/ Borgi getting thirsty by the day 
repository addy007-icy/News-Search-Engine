Having three acres of land on the outskirts of Borgi village didn’t help Biradar Santosh, a farmer, who had expected to continue farming. He couldn’t cultivate his land owing to lack of rains in the last two years.He was sure that the situation won’t change until July when the rainy season begins. Though he took up certain menial jobs in the neighbouring village, he could not meet the requirements of his family. Having no other option, he left for Bengaluru to work in a hotel. He was offered Rs. 8,000 per month in which he somehow managed to send home some money.But he couldn’t continue working there as his family began facing problems. He returned to his village in Manoor mandal, one of the most backward mandals in the district.As almost all the bore-wells in the village have dried up, the family members – his wife and two children – were forced to fetch water from an agricultural bore-well, about three km from his village. Santosh and his family members walk for about three km to fetch three pots of water thrice a day for cooking and other needs. They also take their cattle in one of their trips.Another resident of Borgi, Ganapathi Rao (58) and his wife Paryaga Bai, walk the same distance to fetch water every day. The water problem that they are facing seems to have been worsening day by day. The water yield of the agricultural bore-well seems to be reducing too. Fearing water shortage, they have already found a new place to fetch water from. It’s a tank located more than 10 km away from the village. “We suspect that in the next one month or so, the agricultural bore-well will go dry. There will be no other option but to walk 10 km to get water,” laments Santosh.
