The Finance Department is understood to have recommended substantially slashing the devolution of Plan funds to local bodies for the next financial year and freezing the Fifth State Finance Commission (SFC) recommendation award for the time being.The government, considering the resource crunch, is understood to have reached a broad understanding to shelve the SFC recommendation to award Rs.8,500 crore to local bodies for 2016-17 for the time being and fix it at around Rs.7,300 crore.The alternative proposals to cut the allocation are likely to come up at the Cabinet on Wednesday. Finance Department sources told The Hindu here that the fiscal crisis would intensify in the next two months and the government may not be able to bear the pressure on implementing the Tenth Pay Commission recommendations which were expected to cost about Rs.7,700 crore and also honour other major commitments. In this context, the department top brass suggested to freeze the SFC recommendation to award 20 per cent of the tax revenue to 1,200 local bodies to meet their functional expenses.The SFC had recommended to allocate 28 per cent of the Rs.8,500 crore as maintenance fund for road and non-road assets, 17 per cent as general purpose fund, and 55 per cent as development fund.The Finance Department had mounted pressure on the SFC to include the Union Finance Commission grant in the devolution to local bodies and to reduce its burden, but it refused to oblige. As per the latest recommendation, the local bodies would get Rs.1,300 crore as Central grant.This is reported to have enraged the Finance Department top brass, sources said. The commission has mooted a flexible devolution pattern, wherein the allocation would be based on the Stateâ€™s Own Tax Revenue every year.Resource mobilisationThe onus to optimise resource mobilisation has thus been placed on the government. The move to shelve the SFC recommendations will deplete the resources of local bodies and will paralyse their functioning. They may not be able to discharge even the routine functions. Putting the recommendations of the SFC on hold was unconstitutional, sources said.
