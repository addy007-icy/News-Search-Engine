The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has been operating more than 40 additional services, apart from 400 regular buses for the last few days to handle the extra rush of passengers during the Sankaranti festival.The corporation has allocated more than 20 services on the Srikakulam-Visakhapatnam route where the demand is high.In all, eight buses have been allocated for long distance services, including those to Hyderabad and Vijayawada. The officials said that the online reservation facility had been improved to ensure ease of booking tickets. The RTC will collect 50 per cent extra charge for travelling in the long distance services as the occupancy ratio will be less during the return journeys. The charge is around Rs. 1,350 per ticket between Srikakulam and Hyderabad.Srikakulam Deputy Chief Traffic Manager K.Srinivasa Rao said the occupancy ratio had gone up to 70 per cent ahead of Sankranti .“We have decided not to collect extra charge for short distance services. Around 50 per cent extra is being collected only for special buses. Normal services are also being operated” he added.According to him, the rush will be more on January 16 and 17 as majority of the passengers would return to their places.On an average, the Srikakulam APSRTC Srikakulam wing collects around Rs. 35 lakh per day and it may go up to Rs. 45 lakh per day during the Sankranti festivities, he added.RTC will collect50 p.c. extra charge for long distance services, short distanceones spared
