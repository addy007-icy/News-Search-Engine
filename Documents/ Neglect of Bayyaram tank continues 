The immense irrigation potential of the historic Bayyaram Cheruvu, the medium irrigation project with a registered ayacut of 7,200 acres in Bayyaram mandal, continues to remain untapped.Against the full level of 16.5 feet, the water level in the historic tank is presently five feet.The accumulation of enormous volume of silt in the tank has drastically reduced its storage capacity, thereby denying the assured irrigation facilities to the ayacutdars of nearly 12 villages in Bayyaram and Garla mandals, sources said.There has been consistent demand for desilting the tank and taking up the long pending canal modernisation works.It was not included in the first phase of Mission Kakatiya by the government departments concerned citing it as a medium irrigation tank, points out Bayyaram ZPTC member G. Ilaiah.We have requested the authorities to include the Bayyaram tank, dating back to Kakatiya era, at least in the next phase of Mission Kakatiya, he says, deploring that the long pending proposal to modernise the canal system at an estimated cost of Rs. 49.50 crore is yet to take off.The government should elicit the views of the ayacutdars of the medium irrigation project before taking any decision on its reported move to make the tank an integral part of the redesigned Dummugudem project, he says emphasising the need for safeguarding the interests of the ayacutdars of the historic tank.
