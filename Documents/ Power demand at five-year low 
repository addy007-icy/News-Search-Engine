: While the biting cold has given Delhi a miss this season, city dwellers are happy for reasons beyond pleasant weather.Thanks to the warm winters, power demand in the Capital has fallen considerably since December because of which consumers can expect lower electricity bills.Although January is yet to be over, comparison of the peak power demand this month with that of previous years’ reveals that the demand, so far, has been the lowest in five years. Maximum power consumption this month has been 3,862 MW, which was recorded on January 1 at 10:08 am, whereas last year at the same time it was 4,405 MW.Data provided by the MeT department suggests that this January has been relatively warmer than last six years with the highest maximum temperature at Safadarjung observatory being recorded at 26.5 degree Celsius (January 5). “It has been a mild winter so far. So, usage of heaters, immersion rods and geysers has also come down. Hence, power demand has shown a general downward trend,” said an official of the power department.Officials also added that the power demand trend this month is something which occurs during February and March. “Delhi’s distribution companies had prepared for a winter peak demand of about 4,600 MW this season. But, the trends suggest that so much power won’t be actually required. So, discoms are rationing their procurement to avoid buying surplus power,” added the official. During February and March, when the winter is in its final leg, the peak demand for electricity averages at around 3,400 MW.December also depicted a similar trend with the power demand peaking at only 3,944 MW which is 327 MW less than 2014’s December.
