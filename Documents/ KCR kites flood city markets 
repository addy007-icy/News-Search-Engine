Forget the posters, it is going to be a battle of green kites and pink kites in the skies of Hyderabad this Makar Sankranti. Thousands of pink kites with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s photo have flooded the markets here in the city.The kites, which feature the iconic Charminar along with KCR’s picture, seem to be a precursor to the TRS’ campaign for the upcoming Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).In the crowded markets of Dhoolpet, several shops have stacked up the pink plastic kites, on which the words ‘Jai Telangana’ have been boldly printed. Priced at Rs.4 in wholesale, and between Rs. 5 to 8 in retail, the kites are available at most shops.What is interesting is that the kite is the symbol of the All India Majilis-e-Ittihadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party. “They were present in the market before as well, and last year after the State was bifurcated, each kite sold for as high as Rs.50, as people were sentimental. This year, the sales are not that high,” said Anoop, from Aakash traders.Another shop owner at Dhoolpet, requesting anonymity, said that the stock has come from places such as Kanpur, Ahmedabad and Nagpur. Though TRS leaders said that they were not aware of the kites being sold, traders who are selling them said that the kites are being sold at almost every major market. When contacted, State Commercial Taxes Minister said that the party had nothing to do with it.
