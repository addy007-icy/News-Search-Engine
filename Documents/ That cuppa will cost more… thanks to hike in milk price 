The city’s favourite time-pass and essential pick-me-upper is bound to cost more with the State government announcing a Rs. 4 hike for a litre of milk.Within a week, the price of coffee and tea, essential to the city’s culinary culture, will be hiked between Re. 1 and Rs. 2, said Chandrashekar Hebbar, president of Bruhat Bengaluru Hoteliers’ Association.Sources said that in some hotels where the price of coffee/ tea is between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15, the price may be rounded off at Rs. 15.“The effects of the hike will not be immediate. Hotels may take around four days, see the balance sheets and decide accordingly. But, with the vegetable prices remaining high, it is a tough balance between price and quality,” he says, adding that north Indian restaurants that use butter and milk cream in their curries will also see hikes in the prices of dishes.Another victim will be sweets, which use copious amounts of milk. On average, this may lead to Rs. 10 per kg increase for many sweets, said Mr. Hebbar.At Sri Venkateshwara Sweet Meat Stall, the price of milk-based sweets, pedas, kova, barfis, has been hiked by Rs. 20 a kilo effective from Sunday itself.A juice centre owner from the Sri Ganesha fruit Juice Centre said the “steep” hike will see the prices of milkshakes in parlours go up. “It may lead to an increase of around Rs. 2-3 across the board,” he said.‘Within a week, the price of coffee and tea will be hiked between Re. 1and Rs. 2’
