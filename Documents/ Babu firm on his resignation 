On a day when the High Court threw out a petition that a sought a stay on the Thrissur Vigilance Enquiry Commissioner’s directive to launch an investigation in the bar bribery case against him, K. Babu was busy interacting with a bunch of budding cartoonists in the city on growing intolerance in the country.Mr. Babu, who stepped down as Excise and Ports Minister in the wake of the order on Saturday, made it clear on Monday that he would not take back his resignation. This, when the State machinery went on an overdrive to stall the Vigilance probe ordered against him.While Chief Minister Oommen Chandy had not accepted his resignation, Mr. Babu said he was just a people’s representative now and that he would soon vacate his ministerial bungalow and office. “I’ve sent a fax message seeking accommodation in the MLA hostel. Permission has also been sought for appointing a personal assistant,” he told the finalists of the State-level cartoon contest jointly organised by the Cartoon Academy and Toonz Animation Academy. Earlier, he said Indian culture hinged on the principle of tolerance. “There are those taking on criticism with political and religious intolerance. They approach cartoons with prejudice. But cartooning is as tough a task as presenting humour in films.”
