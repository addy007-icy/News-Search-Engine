Big-hitting West Indies batsman Chris Gayle is set to be banned from future Big Bash League tournaments as fallout of his controversial TV interview with Channel 10 journalist Mel McLaughlin.Gayle did escape an immediate suspension after jokingly asking out Mel for a drink date in a mid-match interview, but the destructive batsman was fined $10,000 by his side Melbourne Renegades and now Cricket Australia is set to ban him from BBL, according to a report in Herald Sun.It also reported that Gayle’s immediate playing future remains uncertain, with the Melbourne Renegades considering cutting its ties with the 36-year-old.Though the star batsman did apologise after his “joke” flirt, which was branded “disrespectful” and “inappropriate” by authorities, it is learnt that CA is not willing to invite him back next year.Controversy started when on air, Gayle said he was happy to be interviewed by Mel “just to see your eyes for the first time” during his sides’ win over the Hobart Hurricanes on Monday.“Nice, so hopefully we can win this game and we can have a drink after,” he said.“Don’t blush baby,” the Jamaican added, prompting McLaughlin to shake her head and reply, “I’m not blushing.”“Sorry,” he added, breaking into a big laugh.CA and Big Bash League officials did not see a funny side and condemned Gayle then and there.“I heard Chris’s comments and they’re disrespectful and simply inappropriate,” BBL boss Anthony Everard said in a statement.“There’s just no place in the BBL or — for that matter, cricket anywhere — for that sort of behaviour.”Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland offered support for McLaughlin saying yesterday that no one should have to face such comments, which were “completely out of line” and “inappropriate for the workplace”.
