Just as it has identified Indian Roller (Pala Pitta) as the State bird, the Telangana government is faced with the challenge of naming State fish according to the norms of National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources. The norms stipulate that the governments give official recognition to rare species of fish in their respective States and take steps for their protection.The erstwhile Andhra Pradesh government had recognised ‘Murrell’, found in fresh-water sources the State fish.In the residuary AP, the government did not replace ‘Murrell’ which has left Telangana to look for another species.A daunting task indeed for Telangana, as it did not have a sea coast!Efforts on for Dharmik ParishadThe Telangana government has initiated steps to implement the pre-election promise of TRS to replace Endowments Department with Dharmik Parishad. Though Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had raised the need for parishad in the initial days of the government, the issue was side stepped subsequently.Endowments Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy met officials last week to discuss the composition and character of the parishad.The strength of members of the parishad, their tenure, official position and duties were discussed. It was decided to submit a report to Chief Minsiter K. Chandrasekhar Rao after studying all these aspects.No new collegesthis yearThe Telangana government has decided not to sanction any more private degree colleges in the State in the academic year 2016-17 as their number has already crossed 1,100. In 2013-14, alone, about 300 colleges were sanctioned.A meeting of Telangana State Council of Higher Education with the Deans of Universities in the State last week noted that the existing colleges itself had several vacant seats every academic year and that it served no purpose to sanction new ones.Hence, it was decided to grade existing institutions for students to pick and choose and colleges to upgrade standards.Intrusion into I&PR networkIt’s a common knowledge for users of communication tools enabled by information technology that the official communication systems in many government departments, including their websites are not properly safeguarded or prone to intrusion and hacking.That’s the reason why we often come across the news of official websites getting hacked. One such intrusion came to light recently when the official communication handle of Telangana Publicity Cell in the Secretariat, a wing of Information & Public Relations Department, was used to send a political communication through the system.This reporter was one of the recipients of a communication about release of the first list of Majlis Bachao Tehreek candidates for GHMC elections on January 15. It was kind of a shocker to receive such communication from the Publicity Cell as it’s meant only to disseminate information about the government.Shortage of AIS officers continuesThe nascent Telangana State’s scarcity of All India Service (AIS) officers continues to bug the administration even 20 months after its existence. Following bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and division of AIS cadre, a total of 163 IAS officers were allocated to it with an effective strength of 133. However, 15 officers have retired so far since June 2014 after attaining the age of superannuation, but 10 new officers were allotted during the period adjusting the effective strength to 128. Even this strength is not in a position to last longer as four more officers are due for retirement this year and the effective number would slip to 124.At a time when the government is actively considering formation of new districts, ranging from 12 to 14, and its plans to pace up implementation of welfare and development programmes over the next three years, it is assessed that another 60 IAS officers are requiredTelangana is seeking scientific and rationale attitude in the allotment of AIS officers stating that several smaller States – Chhattisgarh (133), Kerala (156), Haryana (157), Punjab (179), Odisha (182 and Gujarat (210) – have more IAS officers than it.The State government has formally made the request to Centre, but only time will tell how considerate the Centre could be to its needs.N.
