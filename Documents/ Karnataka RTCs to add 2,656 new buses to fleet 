The four State road transport corporations are set to procure 2,656 new buses in this financial year to replace old buses in their fleet.Disclosing this to reporters in Bengaluru on Monday, Transport Minister R. Ramalinga Reddy said the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation will procure 658 and 986 buses respectively. The North-East RTC and North-West RTC will buy 702 and 310 buses respectively.Tenders had already been invited for the purchases, which include 20 buses from Scania and six from Corona companies, he said.He said the RTCs were following eco-friendly norms by scrapping buses that had run 8.5 lakh km as against the practice of other States that allow their buses to do 12 to 14 lakh km. This was the reason why the average age of fleets of Karnataka RTCs stood at 5.2 years, making it the youngest in the country.He ruled out the possibility of RTCs reducing bus fares in the wake of reduction in diesel prices.Odd-even normMr. Reddy said the Transport Department had not only keenly watched the odd-even traffic norm implementation in Delhi, but had also sought a report from them to know if it could be implemented in Bengaluru. However, it was the Home Department which would take a call on it, he noted.
