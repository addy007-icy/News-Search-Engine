The Telugu Desam Party is open to the like-minded leaders, Deputy Chief Minister and TDP Polit Bureau member K.E. Krishnamurthy has said.These remarks came in the backdrop of the growing resentment in some sections of the TDP Nellore district unit on the recent entry of the partyâ€™s once political rival Anam brothers, who recently shifted their loyalties from the Congress. Mr. Krishnamurthy, who visited Nellore on Friday, spoke to the media at the party office in the morning. Setting aside the allegations levelled by the YSR Congress, the Deputy Chief Minister said that YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy was making baseless allegations against the government on the issue of arrests of his party leaders.He asserted that it was very clear that YSR Congress MP P. Mithun Reddy was arrested in the assault case involving an Air India official at Renigunta airport in which the government had no role to play at all. With regard to MLA Chevireddy Bhasker Reddy, he said the legislator was arrested in a case involving stopping of a train during the Samaikyandhra agitation and his arrest came after he skipped railway court hearings several times.Mr. Krishnamurthy said that instead of helping in the progress of the State, YSRC MLAs were trying to put hurdles in the welfare programmes and activities that were aimed at bringing development.The Minister also promised to take up in the coming Cabinet meet the demand for adoption of a resolution by the State Legislature urging the Centre to include Prakasam district in the list of seven backward districts for Special Development Package(SDP) under the State Reorganisation Act.Charges levelled by the YSRC that the TDP is playing vindictive politics are baseless- K.E.
