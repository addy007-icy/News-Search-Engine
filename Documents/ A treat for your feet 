An orange ice-cream-shaped something crumbles in the tub under the warm running water. And, I soak my weary feet into it breathing in the fruity flavours.I am at Green Trends in Race Course for the newly introduced ice cream pedicure, done with U.K. based Bomb range of products that are organic and handmade.“The cleanser comes packed with essential oils, shea butter, and avocado that cleanses the skin, opens up the pores and moisturises the skin,” May Nancy Rajesh, the technical trainer from Chennai, tells me as the beautician scrubs my feet clean of the dead cells, files my nails, applies cuticle cream…Next is a massage with a black currant scrubber which doubles up as body polish and removes stubborn dead cells and moisturises too.The next step involved covering the feet with a mask that smells of freshly squeezed lime (there is also orange, jasmine and lavender flavours to choose from). This seals the pores and nourishes the skin.“All the products are shaped like ice cream and donuts. The organic ingredients and fresh fruit extracts moisturises your skin, removes dirt without damaging the skin, and improves tone too when done regularly. Especially for working women whose feet are prone to more pollution and dirt. There are different flavours like shower power and vanilla that work effectively on dry skin,” explains Nancy.Once the mask is wiped off, my feet are pampered by another round of moisturising massage with body butter, which I wished would never end. It left my feet feeling soft and supple.And, there is more! Another round of uplifting fragrant massage with an orange scented candle.Finally, I had to pick a nail-paint of my choice and with two coats of an apple green polish, my feet looked and smelt so good.
