Construction of 104 km-long Angul-Sukinda railway link, an important industrial corridor, has gained momentum as the project has received forest clearance for laying of track.“We have in physical possession of all required land – 1470 acres. Although work has commenced in different stretches, projects are yet to be undertaken in forest land which constitute 31 per cent. Now, we have got forest clearance last week that would speed up the project,” said Angul-Sukinda Railway Limited (ASRL) managing director Dillip Samantray here on Tuesday.Speaking on the sidelines of ‘SMART Infra Odisha’, an infrastructure convention organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Samantray said: “We hope to complete the project, which has very high internal rate of return, by June 2018.”Industrial projects coming up in central Odisha will be hugely benefited by the project, which would handle about 80 million tonne traffic.“At present, the total project cost is about Rs.1,200 crore and it is expected to touch Rs.1,600 crore including the interest on investment capital. The cost appeared to be higher as 78 small and medium bridges will be constructed in the 100-km stretch,” Mr. Samantray said.To implement the project, a special purpose vehicle was constituted with 57 per cent of equity in control of Indian Railway subsidiaries, 37 per cent with the State government and the Jindal group holds 10 per cent.“We have already secured Rs.1,100 crore as loan. Whenever we require, we will avail fund accordingly,” said Mr. Samantray.
