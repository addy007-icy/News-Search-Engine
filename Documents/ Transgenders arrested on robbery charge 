Raja (29) of Sengipatti in Thanjavur district engaged in rice business came to Tiruchi from Karur district in the late hours on his way home.While proceeding towards the central bus stand, Raja came across Govindaraj who reportedly told him that he was proceeding to Thanjavur in the car and that the latter could board the vehicle, the sources said.Raja boarded the car inside which Priya and Sania were seated. As the car reached Mannarpuram, one of the transgenders laid her hand on the gold chain worn by Raja.The businessman, apparently annoyed at this, slapped the transgender’s hand. The transgenders allegedly snatched the gold chain from Raja who got down midway.Even before the car sped away, Raja noted down the vehicle’s registration number and informed the beat constables on duty at TVS Tollgate area. The Cantonment Crime police, who were alerted about this, intercepted the car and apprehended the accused.The Cantonment Crime police booked a case under IPC section 392 (robbery) against the accused who were remanded in judicial custody.
