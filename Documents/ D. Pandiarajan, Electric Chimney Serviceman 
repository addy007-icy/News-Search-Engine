Keeping chimney free of oil stains plays a major role in maintaining health and hygiene of the family. Chimney cleaning is not a rocket science. I never went to any institute to learn the art. Aptitude and application helped me to excel in this field.Being the eldest in the family, the responsibility of earning for the family fell on my head. I chose the job as I was interested in maintenance of domestic machinery. Initially, I was entrusted with the job of drilling holes on the wall and later I learnt the nuances of fixing chimneys and removing oil stains with the help of soap solution.Two decades ago, electric chimneys were considered a luxury and came with modular kitchen package. That was the time I thought chimneys could become an important value addition for modern kitchen and set up my own service unit. My prediction came true and now I am busy.Too much into my work I did not have the time to think about my personal life. Now at 36, I am in a comfortable position. I got married last year. My wife is a homemaker and she does not interfere in my business. Recently I took the service centre franchise of a popular Italian brand chimney. I am in charge of the service for six districts.From an unknown entity to a dependable chimney serviceman, I have learnt my lessons well and I am a satisfied man now.(A fortnightly column on men and women who make Madurai what it is)
