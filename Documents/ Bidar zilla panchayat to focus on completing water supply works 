With Bidar facing a severe drought, the zilla panchayat is focusing on completing water supply works quickly and planning for the future.The panchayat has fixed deadlines to complete all works under the Jal Nirmal Yojana, multi-village drinking water supply scheme, and other individual schemes, and has given the responsibility to oversee the project to district-level officers.A team of senior officials, led by Pavan Kumar Malapati, zilla panchayat chief executive officer, will stay overnight in a village in a different taluk every month, to inspect works and receive grievances.“A month-wise contingency plan is being readied for actions to be taken up every month till the next monsoon,” says Mr. Malapati.Apart from using surface and borewell water, the works include identification, cleaning and reuse of traditional water bodies like open wells, lakes and tanks. They also include repair, flushing, hydro fracture and energisation of dried bore wells or of those bore wells that have reduced yields.Attempts will be made to reach two important targets before summer: setting up 360 reverse osmosis drinking water plants and creating recharge pits for all dead and low-yielding bore wells.A simple design to recharge borewells was perfected by the zilla panchayat 10 years ago and it included trenching, creating a filter with boulders, sand and coconut fibre, and cutting out slits in the metal vertical pipe. Then CEO Naveen Raj Singh, P.M. Khan, senior geologist and engineers like Arun Kumar recharged over 400 dead bore wells by spending less than Rs 2,000 for each pit. “We will carry forward this design and try to keep the cost low,” a senior engineer said.
