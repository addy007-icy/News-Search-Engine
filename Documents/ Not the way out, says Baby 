Quality improvement in the higher education sector cannot be effected by giving market forces unfettered access to invest in the higher education system, former Education Minister M.A. Baby has said. In an interview to The Hindu , Mr. Baby said the GEM theme paper’s assertion that the main benefit to a potential investor would be societal prestige was an attempt to hoodwink the people and those who opposed privatisation of higher education. Economist Amartya Sen has said that while he welcomes private investment in many sectors, the State should have the commanding role in education and health. The State should invest more in higher education. There has been an erosion of quality in higher education. Inviting private players into the fray is not the way out, he said.“The paper also speaks of inviting foreign institutions to set up shop here. The promise is that of joint degrees, twinning programmes, faculty exchanges and so on in self-financing mode. Courses would be offered here with tie-ups to “education shops” based in the West. Who will be able to afford this?,” he asked.The quality of institutions of higher learning in Kerala should be improved. The college cluster approach can be tried. Academic linkages can be set up with reputable colleges abroad for joint programmes and for student and faculty exchanges.
