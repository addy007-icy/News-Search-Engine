Birth of a still-born baby led to tension at mother and child hospital (MCH) at Siddipet on Monday. Dr. Balaji Pawar said Chandrakala was admitted to the hospital for delivery. After consulting the womanâ€™s relatives, the doctors put her for trail labour for six hours. When the situation was going out of control the doctors tried for the C-section and by that time the baby died in the womb. Alleging that negligence of doctors led to the birth of still-born baby, the relatives lodged a complaint with the police in one town. The police registered a case and were investigating.
