England broke through just before tea to remove AB de Villiers for 88, but Hashim Amla was 132 not out to take South Africa to 290-3 on the third day of the second test on Monday.Steven Finn had De Villiers caught by James Anderson at midwicket to break a 183-run stand with Amla. South Africa was still 339 runs behind England’s mammoth first-innings total of 629-6 declared.Amla made his first test century since December 2014 to lead South Africa’s resistance as it edged toward England’s big score on a dream batting pitch at Newlands. He had hit 19 fours.De Villiers struck 12 fours and a six and their stand gave South Africa a glimpse of hope of getting close to England’s total.With England already 1-0 ahead in the four-game series, South Africa was effectively batting to stay alive in the contest following England’s dominant batting display in its first innings, marked by Stokes’ 258 and his record-breaking partnership of 399 with Jonny Bairstow, who made 150 not out.Amla and De Villiers gave the under-pressure Proteas some relief by batting through the best part of two sessions on the third day. But South Africa still faced an uphill task.Faf du Plessis was 15 not out alongside Amla, and the predictability of the pitch was clear as he had already struck three fours.England dropped two earlier chances to break the Amla-De Villiers stand and take real control of the test.Amla was missed by James Anderson at slip off the bowling of Joe Root when he was on 76. De Villiers was dropped by Root off Anderson early in his innings on Sunday.Amla took full advantage, easing the pressure on his batting form following a lean year in 2015. He passed 50 for the first time since the New Year test against West Indies in Cape Town a year ago. It was his first three-figure score since a double century against West Indies earlier in the same series, and his 24th career test century.The Newlands pitch was proving a very good strip to bat on, underlined by the fact that only four wickets had fallen in the last five sessions of the match, two of them to run outs.Stokes had 1-53 for England after removing Dean Elgar late on Sunday. Finn had 1-60 with De Villiers’ wicket. England ran out South Africa’s other opener, Stiaan van Zyl, for four.England, chasing a first series win over South Africa in 11 years, leads after a strong 241-run win in Durban.
