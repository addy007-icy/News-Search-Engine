China’s surprising move to peg the yuan at its lowest value against the U.S. dollar since 2011, triggered a selloff in global markets on Thursday, bringing alive the fears of competitive devaluation among emerging economies.Indian stock indices fell sharply and the rupee hit a three-week intraday low of 66.96 a dollar as foreign funds continued their exodus from emerging markets. The 30-share Sensex flirted with a 19-month nadir during the day, before closing 554.50 points lower at 24,851.83.The government sought to reassure the markets that the depreciation of the yuan is par for the course as it becomes increasingly market-linked following its induction as a reserve currency by the IMF. India, officials stressed, has the inherent resilience to deal with such emerging challenges.‘On the path of revival’Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said India is firmly on the path of economic revival and has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world.If a cold for the Nasdaq translated into instant fever for emerging markets in the past, it was the Chinese whisper indicating a further slowdown in its stuttering economy that spooked the world on Thursday.Trading in the Chinese equity market was suspended within minutes as the benchmark index breached the 7 per cent circuit limits. This led to all the leading Asian indices losing ground.While Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined more than 3 per cent, Japan’s Nikkei and Singapore’s Straits Times lost in the range of 1-2 per cent. Brent crude oil also fell to its lowest level since April 2004 at $33 a barrel in intra-day trading.A slowdown in China impacts commodity prices as the country is the biggest consumer of many commodities, including base metals. Indian bourses fell for the fourth consecutive day, with the Sensex losing 1,309 points in the last four trading sessions as FIIs sold equities worth more than $300 million.“The China slowdown concerns have been going on for some time and it will only be a surprise if Indian market and currency do not react to it,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, head of equities at Ambit Capital.
