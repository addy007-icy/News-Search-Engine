The first Kochi Metro train will be put to preparatory test runs within the coach depot at Muttom on Wednesday, prior to commencing formal test runs from Saturday.The train will be towed from the inspection bay to the one-km-long test track using a battery-operated rail-road vehicle. A set of current-collecting devices arrived at the depot on Monday for sourcing power from third traction, a third track installed alongside the test track. Each coach will have a pair of devices on either side. A host of static and dynamic tests will be done during the break-in period to evaluate the train’s performance and to identify problems if any, metro sources said.The test track and third track were put to test on Monday. Wednesday’s test run is being done to ensure that the train is foolproof for beginning test runs after it is unveiled by Chief Minister Ommen Chandy on Saturday. Either side of each coach will be wrapped with Kerala-specific themes like kettuvallom, Western Ghats wildlife, kathakali etc., after Wednesday’s test run.The train will be taken back to the inspection bay after Wednesday’s test run conducted to assess braking distance and other parameters. Another test run might take place on Friday, if need be. Fencing is underway to prevent people from venturing into the test track and adjacent third track. Signalling and telecommunication system will shortly be installed on the test track.While test runs will be confined to the depot, trial runs are set to begin in February last in the 6-km-long Muttom-Edapally metro viaduct. Track laying, including of third traction is pending in 2.50 km in the stretch.
