Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday emphasised the importance of coordination and cooperation in a diverse society like India, instead of friction.“Since we are a diverse society, you cannot achieve anything through friction. All we need is coordination and cooperation at all levels,” he said while participating in the valedictory of Swarnanjali, a national ‘Ghosh’ camp of the RSS here.The uniting factor of India’s diverse society was its culture, he said and called for accepting the diversities. Other countries, which had diverse societies, needed uniformity to ensure unity. But such uniformity was not a mandatory need for uniting Indian society, he noted. “In Indian society, one has become all and all have become one,” he remarked. He maintained that only Indian values can show the way forward for the country as well as the world. Describing Indian values as “complete and time-tested ones”, he said even the concept of sustainable living had come from Indian culture.‘Strengthen values’Mr. Bhagwat called upon people to strengthen Indian values and dedicate one hour a day for the welfare of the country.He claimed that everyone in India was a Hindu as they were part of the unique culture, irrespective of whether they accept it or not.The former chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation, K. Radhakrishnan, also spoke.
