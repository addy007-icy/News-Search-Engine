HCL Technologies, the country’s fourth largest software services exporter , on Tuesday reported an almost flat growth in net profit for the December quarter at Rs.1,920 crore mainly due to investments made in new generation technologies.The company, which follows July-June fiscal year, had registered a net profit of Rs.1,915 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue during the quarter grew 11.4 per cent to Rs.10,341 crore from Rs.9,283 crore.In dollar terms, the company's net profit declined 5.4 per cent to $290.8 million in the quarter while revenue grew 5.1 per cent to $1.56 billion.HCL Technologies President and CEO Anant Gupta said the flat growth year-on-year was mainly due to investments made in expansion during the year.“We have seen broad-based growth across sectors and business lines. Our investments and focus on BEYONDigital, Next–Gen ITO and IoT WoRKS will enable us to stay ahead of the curve,” he said.He said the company signed 8 transformational engagements during this quarter with more than $ one billion of total contract value.The company’s shares ended the day at Rs.838.50 apiece, down 0.58 per cent from its previous close on the BSE.Dipen Shah, Senior Vice-President and Head Private Client Group Research at Kotak Securities said, “The results were lower than expectations. Margins continue to reflect profitability challenges faced by HCL Technologies in a bid to sustain high growth. SG&A spends at about 13 per cent do not provide much room for further downsides.”In October last year, the company had said it has invested about Rs.1,300 crore towards setting up development and collaboration centres globally, hiring senior talent and on new technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud.The company is also expanding its presence in China to cater to its clients that have a manufacturing presence in the country.On the impact of Chennai floods, Anil Chanana, CFO at HCL Technologies did not share specific details. “We managed the situation well with the business continuity and disaster management kicking in. We were able to keep the impact at a minimal,” he said. The company has about 30,000 employees in Chennai.
