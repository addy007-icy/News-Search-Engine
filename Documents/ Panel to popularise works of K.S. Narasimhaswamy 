To mark completion of the birth centenary of K.S. Narasimhaswamy, whose name is synonymous with lyrical poetry in Kannada, the Karnataka government has drawn up a plan to popularise his writings and set up a seven-member committee to take the idea forward.The centenary celebrations committee is headed by writer and critic Narahalli Balasubrahmanya and Mekhala Venkatesh, granddaughter of the poet. Its primary task will be taking his poetry to the younger generation, with a critical review of his works, said Mr. Balasubrahmanya.Born in Kikkeri of Mandya district on January 26, 1915, K.S.Na. carved a niche for himself in Kannada literature in the Navodaya (Romantic) phase. He is still known for his simple poetry of love and the joys and sorrows of every day living. His first collection Mysoora Mallige , published in 1942, has gone into multiple editions. Inspired by Robert Burns, his poems were unique to the language at a time when most Kannada poets dealt with nature and natural world.Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Balasubrahmanya said a half-acre plot in Kikkeri can be developed into an important reference centre with all important books in Kannada. There was also a need to do a visual or digital documentation of his life and works, he said.January 26, 1915: Born in Kikkeri, Mandya district1977: Conferred Sahitya Akademi Award for Tereda Bagilu1995: Awarded Pampa Prashasti1991: Presided over the 60th Kannada Sahitya Sammelan, Mysuru1996: Named Fellow of Sahitya AkademiDecember 27, 2003: Passed away in Bengaluru
