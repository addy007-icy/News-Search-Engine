Seven new e-toilets set up at different parts of the city will be opened for the public on February 1.K. Anvar Sadath, Chief Executive Officer of Eram Scientific Solutions, the firm that has set up the toilets, told The Hindu on Friday that in addition to the toilet units that have been set up at Mananchira Square (2 units), Institute of Maternal and Children’s Health in Medical College (2 units) and Medical College Casualty and near the Corporation Office on Kozhikode Beach (2 units), the firm is setting up two sewage treatment plants in the Corporation.No user chargeTogether it cost the firm Rs.21 lakh, but is being provided free of cost to the Corporation as part of the company’s social commitment.The company plans to make the usage of all the e-toilets free of cost. Earlier, they were operated by inserting a coin in the designated slot. The company, in association with the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation, also plans to organise a campaign to popularise the e-toilets.Reacting to charges of poor maintenance of the e-toilets set up in the city in 2010, Mr. Sadath said that these had suffered several setbacks such as unavailability of water and electricity. The company that also maintains the toilets had tried to provide water in tanker lorries in the early stages, but stopped later as it started affecting the electronic components in the units. Despite several attempts, the situation could not be solved, particularly in places like Stadium, Devagiri and Muthalakkulam where there were two units each, along with Cheruvannur and Beach.The Ombudsman for Local Self-Governing Institutions, in a sitting on Thursday, directed the City Corporation to get all the e-toilets in the city ready for public use before its next sitting on March 30.
