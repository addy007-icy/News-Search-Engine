The Bahujan Samaj Party on Tuesday dismissed a post-poll alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh.The party said it would prefer to stay in the Opposition than form a government with the BJP in 2017.“There is no scope of that by a far stretch. No pre-poll or post-poll alliance with the BJP. We are confident of coming to power with a full majority,” Leader of Opposition in the U.P. Assembly, Swami Prasad Maurya told The Hindu.“We have seen the khooni chera [bloody side] of the BJP... If we fail to reach the majority mark, we will prefer to stay in the Opposition rather than join hands with the BJP,” the senior BSP leader said in an interview ahead of party supremo Mayawati’s 60th birthday celebrations.At a time when the Ram Mandir Ayodhya issue is gaining heat, Mr. Maurya’s words assume significance as it would allay the fear among Muslims. A section of the community has been suspicious of the BSP as it has allied with the BJP thrice in the past. Ms. Mayawati is hoping for a consolidation of her core Dalit voters, with poor upper castes and Muslims.Observers predict a three-way contest involving the BSP, the ruling SP and BJP. Though confident of a win, Mr. Maurya expressed concern over looming polarisation attempts by the BJP’s affiliates, led by the VHP, which has renewed its Ayodhya movement of late. He alleged that the SP and the BJP were working together tacitly to communally polarise the State ahead of the polls. “They will try to make Hindus and Muslims fight. Over 700 riots, including 216 major ones, have taken place under this government. Both parties need to save their political face and they will resort to polarization again. We will go out among people and appeal them to not fall for this trap,” Mr. Maurya said.The BSP is keeping a close eye on the developments in Ayodhya as it fears polarisation along communal lines would damage its own vote banks. “It is the SP’s duty to check anarchic elements. But it is conspiring with the BJP to divide people along religious lines,” Mr. Maurya said.To further his point, the BSP leader recalled the law and order situation in UP in 2010 when the Allahabad High Court gave its order on the Ayodhya matter. “When the BSP was in power, lawless elements like the VHP would go hiding,” he said.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP suffered a humiliating defeat as it failed to open its score. Mr. Maurya believes that the climb back up from zero won’t be that hard as the Narendra Modi government has lost its charm and people feel betrayed by the Akhilesh Yadav regime. He reposed faith that the BSP’s voters who had “strayed” in 2014 would return to the party.“Modi’s karishma (magic) is over. The chant of Ache Din turned out to be a flop. Delhi and Bihar proved that,” Mr. Maurya claimed.While flaying the Akhilesh Yadav government, he said it had failed on all fronts and betrayed the people with false promises. Instead it was "showering generosity" on goonda and mafia elements. “It appears that the SP government is not accountable to the people but to goondas and mafia, who are free to tear the law and order into shreds with the backing of the government. Even the police cannot do much about it,"said Mr. Maurya. He also alleged that the SP government was acting with a vendetta against Dalit officials in the bureaucracy and neglecting monuments built in honour of B.R. Ambedkar.
