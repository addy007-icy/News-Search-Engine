: Officials of the Air Intelligence Unit at the Cochin International Airport Limited on Tuesday arrested a passenger from Dubai and seized about 2.7 kg of gold worth Rs 71.9 lakh, from his possession.Acting on a suspicion, officials intercepted Ummer, a native of Palakkad, who landed at the airport on Wednesday morning. He did not make any declarations about the gold and also replied in the negative when asked whether he had any gold in his possession.During an examination, the sleuths stumbled on a set of gold rods and plates, concealed inside his baggage.Last week, the customs officials had foiled a couple of ingenious attempts to smuggle gold from Dubai by concealing it inside mobile phones and mixing it in Moisturiser and Facial Scrub.The person has been taken into custody and a follow-up investigation is on.
