The TJAC leaders V. Prabhakar and Gaini Gangaram, here on Wednesday, demanded CBCID probe into the accidental deaths of Dalith leaders Talari Satyam and Chepuri Ravi who were killed when a sand tipper hit the motorbike in which they were travelling at Ambedkar Chowrasta in Armoor town on January 9.Speaking at the round table conference on the revival of the NDSL factory here, the JAC spokesman and CPI (ML-New Democracy) leader Mr. Prabhakar pointed finger at the alleged role of an elected representatives from the district. “There are doubts about the role of the legislator as the vehicle involved in the hit-and-run belongs to his close relative,” he said.Moreover, the TJAC leaders alleged that the said legislator reportedly had enmity with Talari Satyam, who contested the last Assembly election as Republic Party of India candidate. Mr. Prabhakar maintained that the victim had moved the High Court seeking disqualification of the sitting member as the latter had concealed facts in his election affidavit.Facts would come out if CBCID enquiry was ordered and the guilty if any must be punished severely, said Mr. Prabhakar. Expressing doubts over the deaths of the duo, the TNGOs’ Association district president and JAC convener Gaini Gangaram appealed to the JAC leadership to fight for justice to the bereaved families. When contacted the Deputy SP, Akula Ram Reddy said that they were accidental deaths and the tipper driver, a Maharashtrian boy, was arrested and the vehicle was seized. A case was also booked against one Nakkala Ramulu, the tipper owner.
