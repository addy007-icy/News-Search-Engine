: The Udupi district unit of the State High School Assistant Teachers’ Association has urged the State government to increase the pay scales of assistant teachers.Addressing presspersons here on Friday, K. Kiran Hegde, president of the district unit of the association, said that the present scale of Rs. 17,650 - Rs. 32,000 a month should be revised to Rs. 19,000 - Rs. 34,500 a month. Although the assistant teachers had repeatedly raised this demand with the government, no action had been taken so far.The number of postgraduate assistant teachers in high schools, who were promoted as lecturers of pre-university colleges, should be increased. Benefits of the ‘Arogya Sanjeevini’ scheme given to teachers of government high schools, should be extended to teachers of aided high schools. The student-teacher ratio in schools should be reduced from 70:1 to 30:1, the protesters said.The State High School Assistant Teachers’ Association would stage a dharna seeking fulfilment of all their demands at the Freedom Park in Bengaluru on January 30. Nearly 5,000 assistant teachers would sit on fast that day. If the government did not concede the demands, the association would be left with no alternative but to boycott the evaluation of SSLC answer scripts, Mr. Hegde said.The present scale of Rs. 17,650 -Rs. 32,000 a month should be revised to Rs. 19,000 -Rs. 34,500,K.
