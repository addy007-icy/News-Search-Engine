Come February 1, all monthly pass holders of BMTC will have uniform passes, irrespective of the distance they are travelling. The corporation has cleared the proposal to introduce common passes, which will cost Rs. 1,050 each. The other two slabs – Rs. 825 and Rs. 1,300 – will be done away with.With this, one section of passengers will have to shell out around Rs. 200 more for a monthly pass while another will spend Rs. 250 less. Around 30 per cent of BMTC commuters are said to be pass holders.Explaining the rationale behind the move, BMTC Managing Director Ekroop Caur said the slabs were causing confusion. In addition, the description of ‘city limits’ has changed. “Initially, the services were classified into three: black board, red board and rural. When the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP) became Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, our area of operation increased. We decided to re-classify our routes,” she explained.Responding to criticism that those travelling shorter distances will have to pay more for the passes, Ms. Caur said those who travel less than 10 km (one way) generally don’t buy passes.BMTC officials said it is a win-win for passengers as they can travel any distance without worrying about slabs.However, not everyone is enthused by the idea. Vinay Srinivas, member of the Bangalore Bus Prayanikara Vedike, welcomes the uniform pass, but not the costing.“Instead, the BMTC could have just extended the Rs. 825 pass. Even in the past, we had asked for extension of the black board pass limits. Why are they making public transport expensive and pushing people towards using private vehicles?” He suggested a uniform pass for the city, as that is where the confusion is, and another for rural services.
