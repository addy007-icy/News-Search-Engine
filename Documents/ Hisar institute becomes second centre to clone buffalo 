Scientists at Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes (CIRB) here claimed to have successfully produced a cloned buffalo offspring ‘Cirb Gaurav’CIRB Director Dr Inderjeet Singh said on Sunday that the scientists achieved the success on December 11 last year.“This cloned buffalo calf is distinct from the earlier clones produced in India. As this is produced from cells of ventral side of tail of superior bull buffalo, this part is least exposed to sunlight and may have less mutation rate, and can be good choice for isolation of donor cells to produce healthy clones,” he said.Dr. Singh said the newborn cloned calf, weighed 40.4 kg at the time of birth through normal delivery, was maintaining good health and showing normal activities.With this achievement, CIRB becomes world’s third and India’s second institute to produce cloned buffalo, he said.National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal was the first to produce a cloned calf in India.Dr. Singh emphasised that the use of adult somatic cells of proven males or quality females for cloning can bring revolution by multiplying the superior buffalo germplasm in country.“This achievement has been made under the project entitled. Cloning for conservation and multiplication of superior buffalo germplasm,” he said. PTI
