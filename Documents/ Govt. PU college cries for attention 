The Government Pre-University College in Shirahatti town of Gadag district is a standing testimony of red-tapism in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education that is coming in the way of the smooth functioning of rural colleges.Despite having 106 students, mostly from the deprived sections and achieving a record 83 pass percentage, this college is crying for attention. Since its inception in 2007, the college is functioning in a portion of the primary school. Everything, including classrooms, laboratory and library, has to be managed within the five rooms allotted for the college.Interestingly, the new building of the college constructed a few miles away from the town has been lying unutilised and has turned into a den of anti-social activities. Regretting the lack of necessary infrastructure, the teachers said that it was very difficult to teach and learn with full concentration. The campus and the design of the classrooms are meant for running the primary school and not a college.TiresomeOwing to lack of a full-fledged laboratory, the students have to go all the way to the nearby Lakshmeshwar (20 km away) or Mundargi (50 km away) for practicals. Most of the students here are from weaker sections of society and it was impossible for them to travel such long distances often, the students said.MLC S.V. Sankanur said that he had brought the issue to the notice of Primary and Secondary Education Minister Kimmane Rathnakar several times and even had raised the issue on the floor of the House. But nothing had happened so far.If the Government could not provide facilities, why open colleges at all? he asked.Deputy Director of Public Instruction K.R. Chavan said that the new building has only two rooms and there was no bus connectivity there. A Rs. 1.20-crore proposal to construct a building is lying with NABARD. Despite reminders, the grants were yet to be released. Once NABARD clears the proposal, the new building would come up and the college would be shifted without delay, Mr. Chavan said.
