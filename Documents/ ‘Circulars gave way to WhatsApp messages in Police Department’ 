The advent of mobile technology has not only helped the police department investigate crimes, but has also started gaining precedence over circulars and memos.Speaking after launching the Vodafone’s 4G services in Mysuru, City Police Commissioner B. Dayananda said the Police Department was using mobile technology for receiving data and communication.Police officials receive instructions from senior officials through WhatsApp groups.“Most of the instructions from the Additional Director General’s office flow through WhatsApp groups,” he said, adding that officials no longer wait for circulars or memos. Mr. Dayananda also said that mobile technology has helped the department crack cases.Mr. Dayananda had unveiled a WhatsApp number (8861786385) for the Mysuru City Police in June last year and appealed to the public to make use of the facility for bringing to the notice of the police traffic offences, and other crimes. Several used the facility to alert the police.The Mysuru City Police Commissioner shared his fascination with mobile phones when they became available in India two decades ago. He recalled that he had managed to get a mobile phone brought from abroad when he was a trainee in Mangaluru, and used to hide it from the DIG, who did not have one.
