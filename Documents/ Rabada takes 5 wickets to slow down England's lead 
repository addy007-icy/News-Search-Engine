South Africa took five wickets for 85 runs on the thrid day to restrict England to 323 and a small 10-run lead in the third test at the Wanderers on Saturday.With Joe Root on 106 not out overnight, England appeared on course for a significant first-innings advantage on the third day which could have taken the series out of South Africa’s reach.But Kagiso Rabada sent Root back for 110 early in the first session, and South Africa took regular wickets to stay in the game. Rabada had career-best figures of 5-78.South Africa had wiped out England’s lead by lunch as the home team reached 16-0 in its second innings, a lead of six to leave the match evenly balanced.England leads the four-test series 1-0 over the top-ranked South Africans.ScoreboardSouth Africa 1st Innings: 313 all out.England 1st innings:Alastair Cook c Vilas b Viljoen 18Alex Hales c De Villiers b Rabada 1Nick Compton c Elgar b Rabada 26Joe Root not c Vilas b Rabada 110James Taylor c Bavuma b Morkel 7Ben Stokes c and b Morkel 58Jonny Bairstow c Van Zyl b Rabada 45Moeen Ali c Vilas b Morris 19Stuart Broad b Rabada 12Steven Finn c Vilas b Morkel 0James Anderson not out 0Extras- (1b, 14lb, 9w, 3nb) 27TOTAL- (all out) 323Overs- 76.1Fall of wickets- 1—10, 2—22, 3—74, 4—91, 5—202, 6—242, 7—279, 8—309, 9—311, 10—323.South Africa 2nd innings:Dean Elgar not out 10Stiaan van Zyl not out 6Extras- 0TOTAL- (for 0 wickets) 16Overs- 5.Still to bat- Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Dane Vilas, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Hardus Viljoen, Morne Morkel.
