British car maker Bentley has said that its first SUV Bentayga is the fastest and the most luxurious SUV in the world. The luxury SUV was unveiled in the Frankfurt Car Show in September 2015. Prices start at $229,100 before tax in the U.S., or from £160,200 after tax in Britain, and €208,500 in Germany.The Bentayga is powered by a 6.0 litre, 12-cylinder twin-turbo engine which develops 600hp and will blast you from rest to 100km/h (60mph) in four seconds. Half of the cylinders can shut down in the interests of "economy". Versions of this engine will also likely appear in the Audi (also VW owned) A8 limousine. At the Frankfurt show Bentley said it planned to raise overall output to about 20,000 a year by 2020 from just over 11,000 in 2014, with the Bentayga accounting for between 4,000 and 5,000.Bentley said the diesel engine will be available soon after launch but the plug-in hybrid won't appear until sometime in 2018.(Source: Graphic News)
