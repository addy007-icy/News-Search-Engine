‘Master Blaster’ Sachin Tendulkar was batting on a different pitch and the strokes too were naturally were different, endorsing the campaign against diabetes as the brand ambassador of ‘Changing Diabetes’ initiative of Novo Nordisk, the world’s leading diabetes care company.Speaking with a fluency which is similar to his pristine days with the willow on the cricket field here on Monday, Sachin said that it was high-time the Indians shed their ‘çhalta hai’ attitude when it comes to taking necessary precautions regarding health care.“My wife is a doctor and we do discuss the general health problems afflicting a majority of the population, especially amongst the under-privileged frequently.Sometime back the diabetes affected patients were said to be about 50 million and now about 69.2 million mark,” the sporting icon remarked. “And, this is one record which we don’t want.It has to come down and I am glad to be part of this campaign,” he said.“We need to change our mindset. You can’t take our health for granted. It is imperative to have regular checkups to find any problems and most importantly address them,” Sachin said.“Living a comfortable and healthy life is pretty simple if you understand what to eat and stay away from the unwanted and unhealthy things. Health is the real wealth,” the cricketing great remarked.
