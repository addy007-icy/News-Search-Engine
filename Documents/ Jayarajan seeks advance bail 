While the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team probing the murder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary E. Manoj is mulling different options to arrest CPI(M) district secretary P. Jayarajan, the leader has moved a fresh anticipatory bail application in the district and sessions court at Thalassery.The anticipatory bail application was filed in the court on Friday on behalf of Mr. Jayarajan, who was admitted to AKG Hospital on January 19 when the court rejected his earlier plea after he was served notice to appear before the investigating team.Mr. Jayarajan was on Thursday arraigned as accused in the case as chief conspirator of the crime. The CBI report filed in the court stated that the murder was executed for Mr. Jayarajan and that Vikraman, the prime accused, was his close associate.When contacted, K. Vishwan, Mr. Jayarajan’s counsel, said the application submitted on Friday stated he was named as an accused in the case as per a plan chalked out during the recent visit of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to the district. Citing the Sangh Parivar’s known hostility towards him, Mr. Jayarajan also said in the application that the case was an attempt provoked by his mass influence as a leader. The application would be taken up on January 23, he said.A senior CBI officer involved with the investigation told The Hindu that Mr. Jayarajan’s fresh petition was merely to buy time, as an accused in a case registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act couldnot be granted anticipatory bail. “We can arrest an accused even if he is hospitalised,” the officer.The options before the CBI include serving a notice on the doctor treating Mr. Jayarajan to explain the nature of his ailment and then transfer it to a medical board for a decision, the officer said. The CBI also wants Mr. Jayarajan to exhaust all his legal options meant to avert an arrest.
