R. Vishal, Deputy Commissioner, on Wednesday, emphasised the need for optimum utilisation of blood collected through various voluntary donation camps.Mr. Vishyal was speaking after inaugurating a national voluntary blood donation camp, organised by the district administration and other organisations, at MGM College here.Dr. Vishal said that blood was available at Kasturba Hospital, Manipal; District Government Hospital, Udupi; and Indian Red Cross Society blood bank, Kundapur, in the district.With regard to affordability issue, persons having undergone surgeries could be charged. However, if a person had a below the poverty line (BPL) card, then blood would be provided for free . All pregnant women during delivery, to treat anaemia or post-delivery, if they had lost blood, could be given free blood. But to run a system, a user charge approach was needed. About five decades back, if a blood group matched, complete blood was given. But blood had three important components – red blood cells, plasma and platelets. Blood collected through voluntary blood donation camps should be used completely within a time limit. “Because every unit of blood wasted is something you could have drawn sometime later,” he said.
