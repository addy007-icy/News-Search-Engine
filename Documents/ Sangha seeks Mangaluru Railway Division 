The Udupi Railway Yatri Sangha has urged the Railway Board to include a proposal for forming two divisions for Konkan Railway in the railway budget for 2016-17.In a press release issued here on Monday, R.L. Dias, president of the sangha, said that a Mangaluru Railway Division should be formed from Mangaluru to Madgaon, while a Ratnagiri Railway Division should be formed from Madgaon to Roha. It would help Konkan Railway double its 745-kilometre line from Roha to Thokur.A weekly train should be started from Bandra Terminus to Mangaluru via Vasai Road Junction (Western Railway).This train would help people along 16 railway stations from Dadar to Naigum.A survey should be ordered for the Nandikoor-Karkala-Ujire-Charmady-Mudigere line (South Western Railway). This line would be an alternative to Bengaluru from coastal Karnataka.A weekly train should be started from Vasco Da Gama in Goa to Thanjavur and onwards to Velankanni. This would help both Hindus and Christians visit their holy places.This proposal would involve the South Western Railway, Southern Railway, and Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., the release added.
