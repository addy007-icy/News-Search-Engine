An incentive of Rs.6,000 is unlikely to motivate families to have another child (“The case for going universal”, Jan.21). However, unconditional universalisation is also not recommended. The conditions — registration of pregnancy, antenatal check-ups, immunisation — are very basic and necessary to ensure the good health of both the mother and the child. The government should provide adequate facilities to enable fulfilment of these conditions. Steps like awareness programmes in anganwadis and health centres will be beneficial. India being home to 7.4 million low-birthweight babies, needs to start a programme like the pulse polio campaign to provide adequate care.Nisha Yadav,Rewari, Haryana
