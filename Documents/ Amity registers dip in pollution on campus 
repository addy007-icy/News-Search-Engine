: The Amity University in Gurgaon has claimed that the levels of pollution have gone down in its campus since Delhi started the odd even experiment.Scientists at Amity University Gurgaon Air Quality Monitoring facility, led by Dr. P.C.S Devara, president of the Indian Aerosol Science and Technology Association and Head of Amity Centre for Environmental Sciences and Health, have revealed that the mass concentration of the black carbon showed drastic reduction at Amity University monitoring station at its campus from 15 micrograms per cubic meter on December 31, 2015 to approximately 7.6 micrograms per cubic meter on January 5, 2016.The study also claimed that the levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration over Amity University campus have also gone down considerably. The measurements of columnar Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Total Column Ozone (TCO) and Perceptible Water Content (PWC) have also revealed a significant decrease.Prof P B Sharma, Vice Chancellor of Amity University, said that the reduction in pollution due to odd-even formula was primarily because of subsequent reduction in traffic congestion resulting in considerable reduction in commuting time.“For example, a distance of 70 km from Amity University Gurgaon to Amity University Noida that was earlier covered in more than two hours can now be covered in just over an hour. This directly relates to approximately 30% reduction in the fuel consumption for the same distance traveled on odd/even days,” said Prof Sharma
