Union Minister for Urban Development M. Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday exhorted the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) and other stakeholders in the construction industry to rein in unscrupulous elements by evolving a code of conduct.“The real estate sector is a major growth engine that is driving the economy. The fly-by-night operators cannot be allowed to damage its reputation. While the government is striving to get the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill passed, builders and developers have to do the much-needed self-regulation,” he asserted.Speaking at the CREDAI Property Show here, Mr. Venkaiah said efforts were on to give online approvals needed by the realtors and impose hefty penalties on those who violate norms. Approvals were planned to be locally with proper safeguards.He claimed that the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill would be beneficial to buyers and give enough powers to the authorities to crack the whip on erring realtors.Special statusMr. Venkaiah said the Centre has given ‘special recognition’ to Andhra Pradesh to spur growth in the fledgling State. “What is there in ‘special status? We have sanctioned several important institutions and are giving huge sums for development of AP,” he affirmed.
