Acting tough against the violators of one-way traffic norms, the City Traffic Police have decided to station some of its night patrolling vehicles near four important traffic junctions in the city after 8 p.m. The patrolling teams have been asked to slap a fine of Rs.500 on violators of the rule.As per the arrangements, the patrolling vehicles after their regular rounds in the city will station near Nadakkavu junction, Mavoor road, Pushpa junction and the Commissioner office. This will help the patrolling squads to check majority of one-way traffic rule violations on National Highway 66 and 212 in the city.Last week, the police fined 40 persons for one-way traffic violation.Though there was no relaxation on the 24-hour one-way traffic regulations on any stretch of the NH 66 and 212, some of the motorists were of the false belief that it was not applicable after 8 p.m. As a result, the number of accidents increased in the city.The attempt of the police to divert one-way rule violators from some of the junctions proved vain.“This wrong driving practice is troubling people who loyally follow the rules. The Nadakkavu junction is a dangerous spot, where we have demanded the police to step up night surveillance,” said K.V. Rajan, a resident of the area. Drivers of long-distance buses and inter-State goods carriers are the main villains who did not care the small vehicles, especially the two-wheelers in their reckless race.
