Thanks to the initiative taken by Divisional Railway Manager Chandralekha Mukherjee and her team, the Araku Special train, which literally ran empty last weekend, has turned out to be a big hit on Saturday with a number of tourists utilising this train.It may be recalled that the Araku special passenger train was introduced following a report ‘Additional train needed to Araku’, published in the ‘On The Move’ column on December 29. Two specials from Visakhapatnam to Araku were operated on January 2 and 3 to clear the extra rush of tourists.The lack of announcements over the public address system and display of information at the station resulted in the Araku specials not getting the desired response during those two days. It was again reported in these columns on January 4.It’s learnt that strict orders were issued to the booking clerks and the ATVM (Automatic Ticket Vending Machine) operators at Visakhapatnam on Friday itself to invariably inform tourists on the availability of the Araku Special passenger on Saturday and Sunday (January 9 and 10). Announcements were repeatedly made on the public address system about the special, and while 1 VK Visakhapatnam – Passenger was placed on Platform-5, the Araku special was placed on the adjacent PF-4 for the convenience of passengers.Posters were put at various places at the railway station giving the schedule of the special trains. Passengers appreciated the gesture of the railway officials.
