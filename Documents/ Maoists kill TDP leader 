The banned CPI (Maoists) killed a Telugu Desam leader and former Sarpanch of Jerrela in Visakha Agency, Sagina Venkataramana, on Wednesday morning.Jerrela is the area that has received clearance for bauxite mining through a State government GO No. 97 two months ago. This was in spite of strong opposition from the Girijans and environmentalists over bauxite mining in the entire Agency area spread over Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts.Venkataramana was reportedly woken up from his house at Jerrela on Tuesday night by a group of Maoists accompanied by a large number of militia members. He was taken to village outskirts and hacked to death.This is the second murder committed by the Maoists in the last two days. On Tuesday a native of Boosiputtu in Munchingput mandal, Pangi Sivayya, was killed near near Sariapalli.Venkataramana's murder has shaken the Agency as he supported bauxite mining. Venkataramana had repeatedly said that no resolution had been passed by the Jerrela panchayat in favour of bauxite mining when he was sarpanch. The resolution was a false claim, he at the meetings of CPM and YSR Congress.Maoists have already warned TDP leaders to quit the party, elected posts, party posts and join the agitation against bauxite mining.A few months ago they kidnapped four mandal-level leaders of the party forcing a senior leader like M. Manikumari to quit a party post. Partymen and leaders were not really convinced about Chief Minister N. Chandra Babu Naidu' assurance on bauxite mining and they received a rude shock when GO No97 was issued.
