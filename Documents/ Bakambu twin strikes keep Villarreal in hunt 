Congolese international Cedric Bakambu struck twice as Villarreal moved to within three points of leader Barcelona with its sixth successive La Liga win, 2-0 over Sporting Gijon on Sunday.Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Roberto Soldado provided the ammunition for both his strike partner’s goals with crosses that Bakambu clinically dispatched either side of half-time to take his tally for the season to 12.However, its ambitions of just making the top four may be revised having built up a huge lead over the other expected challengers for a Champions League spot, including Sevilla and Valencia, in the first half of the season.Earlier on Saturday, Zinedine Zidane got his reign as new Madrid boss off to a flying start as Gareth Bale hit a hat-trick in a 5-0 mauling of Deportivo la Coruna.However, it remains two points adrift of Barcelona — having also played a game more — as Lionel Messi also bagged his first hat-trick of the season in the European champion’s 4-0 rout of Granada.The results: Sunday: Villarreal 2 (Bakambu 26, 51) bt Sporting Gijon 0.Saturday: Getafe 1 (Vazquez 57) bt Real Betis 0; Sevilla 2 (Gameiro 24, 59-pen) bt Athletic Bilbao 0; Real Madrid 5 (Benzema 15, 90+1, Bale 22, 49, 63) bt Deportivo la Coruna 0; Levante 2 (Deyverson 72, Morales 81) bt Rayo Vallecano 1 (Hernandez 83); Barcelona 4 (Messi 8, 14, 57, Neymar 83) bt Granada 0.
