The most heart-wrenching image as the city bid farewell to martyred NSG commando Lt. Col. Niranjan E. Kumar was his 18-month-old bundle of joy Vismaya smiling, sitting on her mother’s lap next to her father’s coffin, oblivious to the loss she has suffered.Her mother Radhika K.J., a dentist, was a state of shock and not responding to any of the words of consolation by friends and family. A day after their marriage, Niranjan had excitedly told her that he had been deputed to the National Security Guard (NSG). It all came to an end on Monday. His NSG uniform, beret, shirt and belt were placed on the coffin. A relative observed the ‘Balidaan’ badge on his uniform and remarked that he had lived the motto of his battalion.The body had been airlifted from Pathankot to the city on Sunday night and kept at the Air Force Command Hospital. Niranjan's elder brother Sharath E.K., an air force officer, led the preparations of the farewell to his brother in stoic silence.Emotions ran high as his mortal remains, in a coffin wrapped with the tricolour, were brought to his house in Doddabommasandra on Monday morning. The coffin was carried by NSG commandoes of the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) that Lt. Col. Niranjan was leading and officers of Madras Sappers, where he had first been commissioned more than a decade ago.The sombre mood at the house gave way to cries and wailing. Though some family members insisted on seeing the body, many advised against it, as the body was disfigured.A visibly shaken Shashankan E.K., his younger brother, said that while the family was broken, they were also proud that he had served the country well. “He was so stylish and smart. We always joked that he would have made it big in films if he had not chosen to become a soldier. Today, he lies in a coffin,” he said even as he broke down.
