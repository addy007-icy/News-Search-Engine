Kodikunnil Suresh, MP, secretary of the Congress Parliamentary Party (Lok Sabha), has called for the resignation of Union Minister of State for Labour Bandaru Dattatreya on moral grounds since a criminal case under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act has been registered against the latter in connection with the suicide of research scholar Rohit Vemula of the University of Hyderabad.‘PM must intervene’At a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Suresh said that if Mr. Dattetreya failed to step down on his own, the Prime Minister must drop the Minister from the Cabinet.“Apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintaining a questionable silence on the issue, there are concerted attempts by the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to shield Mr. Dattatreya.”‘A victim’Mr. Suresh said that Rohit, a Dalit, was the latest victim of atrocities unleashed against Dalits by the upper castes all over the country after Mr. Modi took over as Prime Minister.“It is the intolerance agenda wreaked by the Sangh Parivar organisations with the blessings of the BJP which drove Rohit to suicide. I even wonder whether the attitude of the Sangh Parivar smacks of a conspiracy to exterminate the Dalits.”
