Trade unions across the country will hold nationwide protests on March 10 against the government’s labour law concessions for start-ups and its failure to hold negotiations on the unions’ charter of demands.The unions have also questioned the government’s continued push for contentious labour law reforms, in particular its recent decision to grant certain labour law exemptions to start-ups with retrospective effect through an executive order, instead of using the legislative route.The decision to hold nationwide protests, which union leaders said would include widespread demonstrations and ‘ Rasta Rokos’, was taken at a meeting of all the 11 central trade unions, including the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh or BMS.
