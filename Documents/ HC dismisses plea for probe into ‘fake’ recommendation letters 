The Madras High Court Bench here on Monday dismissed a petition seeking a direction to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) to inquire into large number of appointments and transfers made in State-run liquor shops by producing “fake” recommendation letters issued in the name of Natham R. Viswanathan, Minister for Electricity, Prohibition and Excise.Justice M. Venugopal rejected the plea made by B. Selvam, supervisor of a liquor shop run by Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) here, after agreeing with Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian that a complaint lodged by the petitioner with the DVAC had not made out any cognisable offence requiring registration of a First Information Report.The judge pointed out that a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 could be registered only if the complainant had accused a public servant of having demanded or accepted bribe.However, the petitioner had not made any such allegation but for claiming that some transfer orders contained reference to recommendations made by the Minister, his former Personal Assistant and others.In so far as the reference to recommendations were concerned, the judge recorded the AAG’s submission that the DVAC had referred the matter to the Managing Director of Tasmac for appropriate departmental action and the Tasmac MD, in turn, had ordered for a departmental inquiry by the Chief General Manager (Finance) besides relieving a person, Selvam, from the post of the Minister’s Personal Assistant.
