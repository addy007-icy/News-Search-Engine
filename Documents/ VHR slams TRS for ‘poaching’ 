Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member V. Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday accused ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti of poaching upon its cadre in connection with the GHMC elections and alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was ‘”power hungry”.Speaking at ‘Meet-the-Media’ programme organised by Telangana Working Journalists Federation and Hyderabad Union of Journalists, he said the ruling party was “buying our products and putting its label”.This was not correct. If the TRS was strong on development, it should seek votes from people on that plank, he said.He said Congress would be fighting the GHMC elections on the plank of development as all the roads and other amenities in the city were developed when Congress was in power in the united State.The senior Congress leader said that all the three phases of Krishna drinking water project were executed during Congress regime as also the Godavari drinking project was conceived then.‘Confusing people’He said that people were confused whether IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao was the Chief Minister and made light of four ministers, who hailed from Hyderabad for remaining passive.Unlike Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao, who belittled Andhras living here, the Congress leaders never said anything against them and the people should realise that the new-found love of Telangana Chief Minister was deceptive. He also accused Mr. Rao of having gone back on his promise of merging TRS with Congress soon after the bill for bifurcation of the State was introduced in Parliament.ManifestoHe said the Congress manifesto would be released in the next few days and asserted that the party leaders would strive to ensure that majority wards were bagged Congress candidates.
