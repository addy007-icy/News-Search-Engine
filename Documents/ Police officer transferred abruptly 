Anupama Shenai, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kudligi Sub-Division in Ballari district, was abruptly transferred on deputation, allegedly on the direction of P.T. Parmeshwar Naik, Minister of State for Labour, who is also district in-charge, for “cutting a phone call even before he (Minister) spoke”.However, Mr. Naik, when contacted by The Hindu , distanced himself from the controversy stating that it was an administrative matter and that he had nothing to do with it.Ms. Shenai, enquiries revealed, got a call from an unknown number with the caller stating that the district in-charge Minister wanted to speak to her.While she was waiting for the Minister to speak, she got another call from the Superintendent of Police. She cut the earlier call and spoke to the Superintendent of Police. Later, she got another call stating that Minister would be speaking now.Mr. Naik, reportedly irked over the official not holding his earlier call till he had finished speaking to her, took her to task besides taking up the issue with her higher-ups.SpeculationMeanwhile, the ham-handed way in which the official was transferred on deputation has given room for speculation.The transfer on deputation comes at a time when elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats have been announced and the model code of conduct has come into force.The order issued by the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police said that she was first deputed to Athani Sub-Division in Belagavi district and later to Indi Sub-Division in Vijayapura district.Enquiries also revealed that Ms. Shenai was a strict officer and had accorded top priority for implementing the rule of law.
