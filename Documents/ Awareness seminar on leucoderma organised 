An awareness seminar on ‘Leucoderma’ was organised by Leucoderma Awareness Movement (LAM-India), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, run by Leucoderma Awareness Charitable Trust, here on Sunday.In his key-note address, Dr. A. Mahakrishnan, former Dean and HOD, Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital, said that the seminar had been organised to create awareness of vitiligo for the last 17 years, but still it was highly improbable for a patient to marry outside the fraternity of similarly affected persons.In his felicitation address K. Umapathy, secretary, LAM, said that often relationship issues were among the most important social problems that spoilt the happiness of leucoderma patients.To date, LAM-India had facilitated marriage of over 350 vitiligo couples at ‘suyamvarams’ held in Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore and Puducherry.A ‘suyamvaram’ for the leucoderma-afflicted persons would be held in Salem in February, he said.According to LAM-India, it is estimated that about two per cent of the people the world over have leucoderma.In India, it is estimated that roughly four per cent have this disorder.Pa. Devendra Bhupathy, Joint Commissioner Commercial Taxes (Enforcement), Tirunelveli Division, was the chief guest.Dermatologists from neighbouring districts and people afflicted with leucoderma participated in the seminar.
