Connoisseurs in the city are lapping up the fare dished out at the Bahuroopi national theatre festival. The theme of the event being ‘expression’ to resonate with the recent developments in the country and the debate on rising intolerance, the seminars debated issues pertaining to freedom of speech and expression during the inaugural session on Saturday.Eminent intellectual and political analyst Yogendra Yadav saw a co-relation between theatre, truth and politics and said the theme chosen for Bahuroopi was relevant in the present political context of India. He said the current debate on tolerance in the country was “odd”, as it focussed on extracting explanationsfrom the innocent or the oppressed, and aggressively countering the opinion of those dissenting from prevailing views.For theatre aficionados, there is Sharifa to be staged in Kannada at Bhoomiteetha at 3.30 p.m. on Sunday, while Tartuffe will be staged at Kalamandira at 7 p.m. The Bahuroopi film festival will feature the screening of What Happened Ms. Simone at 10.30 a.m. at Sriranga followed by Roots from 12.15 p.m. and Good Night and Good Luck directed by George Clooney at 2 p.m.The highlight of the festival so far was the staging of Julius Caesar by a 45-member troupe of Rangayana, directed by writer and theatre personality G.K. Govinda Rao. The set will not be dismantled and will be used for staging shows in future.
