BJP MLAs in the city met Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung on Wednesday and sought his intervention in the alleged “malfunctioning” of the Arvind Kejriwal government.The delegation apprised Mr. Jung of how “a series of unconstitutional decisions and steps” taken by the Aam Aadmi Party government had resulted in “demoralisation” of the bureaucracy. “The Opposition of the Delhi Assembly met the Lieutenant Governor at Raj Niwas to apprise him of the governance paralysis under the Kejriwal government, which has brought development works in Delhi to a complete halt,” said Vijender Gupta, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly.“The L-G was also apprised that the AAP government is in a mood to get rid of Central government officers posted at senior positions with the Delhi government by replacing IAS and DANICS cadre by its own officers,” Mr. Gupta added. He also alleged that the Delhi government was “falsely propagating” suspension of the two DANICS cadre officials who refused to sign certain files.“Despite media publicity, the government has not actually suspended them. They are performing their duties till date without any interruption,” he alleged. The delegation urged Mr. Jung to “intervene” in the matter and ensure that the government “follows the rule of land,” added Mr. Gupta, who is BJP’s MLA from Rohini.
