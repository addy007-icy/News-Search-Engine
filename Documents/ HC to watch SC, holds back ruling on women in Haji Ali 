The Bombay High Court on Monday said it would wait for the Supreme Court’s decision on women’s entry to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala before it decides on the case pertaining to entry of women inside the Haji Ali Dargah.A Division Bench of Justice VM Kanade and Justice Revati Mohite-dere was hearing a PIL filed by Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA) that states women have always been allowed at the dargah, but in June 2012, the trust restricted their entry to the sanctorum inside the dargah.The HC said on Monday that both the matters (of Sabarimala and Haji Ali) were similar as they involved the entry of women in religious shrines, and hence they would like to wait for the Supreme Court view before deciding on the issue. Advocate Raju Moray, appearing for BMMA brought to the notice of the court instances where film stars and other personalities were allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the dargah and questioned why this prohibition is brought in for other women.The court has asked the Advocate-General Sreehari Aney to be present in court and submit arguments on the next occasion in this case involving a ‘sensitive’ issue, while posting the matter on February 3.Women are not allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the 1,500-year-old Sabarimala temple in Kerala.The temple representatives have argued that the deity is a brahmachari (celibate bachelor) and the Constitution mandates that citizen’s beliefs should be protected. They also cite traditional notions of “impurity”.The trustees of the Haji Ali Dargah told the court that entry of women in close proximity to the grave of a male Muslim saint is considered a grievous sin in Islam. It also said the existing arrangement provides for a secure place for women to offer prayers. “This has been decided in the interest of women and they are as close to the inner sanctorum of the tomb as possible”.
