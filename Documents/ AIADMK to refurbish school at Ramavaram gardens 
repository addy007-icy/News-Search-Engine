When the city was flooded in the recent rains, former Chief Minister and AIADMK founder M.G.Ramachandran’s house in Ramavaram, a property that is close to every party member’s heart and MGR fans, too wasn’t spared.The flood waters of the Adyar broke the compound wall and rushed into the Dr. MGR Home and Higher Secondary School for the Speech and Hearing Impaired on the Ramavaram campus destroying everything including, the hearing aid used by students, classroom amplification, LCD projector system and library books.On Sunday, Ms. Jayalalithaa in a statement said that funds from the AIADMK party would be used to provide equipment for the classrooms, re-build the compound wall, re-lay the interior roads that were damaged and also replace kitchen appliances.Students of the school, numbering nearly 100 were stranded in the hostel building along with staff and trainees of the training centre for teaching the deaf.“When the Chief Minister and AIADMK general secretary heard that our children needed to be rescued, she immediately sent NDRF and Army teams to save them. They were taken to secure high-rise buildings and then later taken to Dr. MGR Janaki College for Women,” said school principal Latha Rajendran.For five days, food from Ms.Jayalalithaa’s house in Poes Garden was supplied to the children and staff. She also ensured that a month’s provisions were provided to the school.CM thankedMs. Rajendran, who thanked the AIADMK supremo for the kind gesture, recalled the time when Ms. Jayalalithaa visited the school in 2008 on the occasion of MGR’s birth anniversary. “She was very happy to be among the children. Even now she sends sweets to the school every Deepavali and Pongal,” Ms. Latha said.Funds from AIADMK will be used to provide equipment for classrooms, says Jayalalithaa
