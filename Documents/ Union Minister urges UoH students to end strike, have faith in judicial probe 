The studentsshould have faith in the measures taken by the Ministry to deal with the issue”, the Minister said speaking to newspersons on the sidelines of National Integration Meet of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samithi here on Saturday.Asked whether the Centre would give into the students’ demand of sacking Vice Chancellor Appa Rao Podile as the confidence-stoking measure, Mr. Kushwaha said the ministry had no role in that aspect and the university itself was competent enough to take whatever action felt necessary.The MoS for HRD, howver, admitted that there was “some shortcomings” found in the university administration and its response to deal with issues related to students, as found by the two-member committee that had already completed its inquiry and submitted report to the Centre.Speaking at the function later the minister said it was unfortunate that circumstances had led to suicide of student on UoH. “Whole of the country has felt sorrow for the deceased. The country doesn’t want its youth to think about killing others or self, irrespective of the reasons, but be responsible and take on situations confidently”, Mr. Kushwaha said.The Prime Minister had vowed to work for better academic and social atmosphere across the educational institutions in the country, he noted.
