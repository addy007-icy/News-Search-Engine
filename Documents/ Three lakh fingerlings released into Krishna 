Irrigation Minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao released three lakh fingerlings into the Krishna River here on Friday.The Department of Fisheries took the initiative of releasing Indian carp fingerlings into the river with an aim to help over 1,200 fishermen families who are residing on the banks of the river from Ibrahimpatnam to upstream Prakasam Barrage.After six months, the fish would grow enabling the fishermen to sell each weighing more than a kg for Rs.100 to Rs.200, according to Assistant Director P. Jayaram.He explained that the Indian carp variety used to lay eggs, but owing to various reasons, the fish population in the river has been dwindling for the last few years affecting the livelihood of fishermen.To assist the families, the department has released the fingerlings that were purchased from a supplier at Rs.40 lakh, he said. The department has also chalked out plans to release fingerlings in Krishna at ghats at Bhavanipuram Tummalapallem, Ibrahimpatnam and Prakasam Barrage.“We will begin the process after completion of the ongoing Janmabhoomi programme,” he said.
