Suggesting a seemingly unlikely cosmic backyard for life, an Indian-American scientist pair has hinted at the possibility of finding Earth-like planets in ancient star clusters. Called Globular Clusters, these groups of ancient stars exist in galactic fringes. Our parent galaxy Milky Way is said to have around 150 clusters. Millions of stars can exist in a cluster that spans just 900 trillion kilometres, which on astronomical scale is small; stars separated by just about 9 billion kilometres, the width of our solar system. For comparison, Sunâ€™s nearest star neighbours Alpha Centauri A and B, are located more than 24 trillion km away! Our solar system is located in a sparsely populated region of Milky Way. The jostling for galactic space not withstanding, Dr. Alak K. Ray of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai and Dr. Rosanne Di Stefano of Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics have argued that properties of globular clusters that make them seem prohibitive to life, could favour its existence.
