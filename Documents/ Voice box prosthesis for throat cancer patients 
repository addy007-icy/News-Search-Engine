Throat cancer patients, who have lost their voice, can look forward to speaking again without spending thousands of rupees on an artificial voice box.An indigenous voice box prosthesis developed by a city-based doctor, which costs not more than Rs. 50, has come to the aid of throat cancer patients whose larynx has been removed.The imported prosthesis currently available in the market costs about 500 dollars (Rs. 30,000) and needs to be changed once in six months.Vishal Rao, Head and Neck Surgeon at HCG, inventor of the voice box prosthesis, said it is an artificial one-way valve device made of silicone. Called ‘AUM’, the device weighs about 25 grams and is 2.5 cm long. During laryngectomy, when the trachea and esophagus are separated, an opening between the food pipe and the windpipe can be created.Even though patients can eat through their mouths, they cannot speak due to the absence of the voice box, Dr. Rao told presspersons.“If air passes through the food pipe in the lungs, it will vibrate and create noise, which can be converted into intelligent speech with coordination from the brain. As food or water should not fall into the lungs, it is a one-way valve device,” he said.One of his patients, Ramakrishna (55), a watchman, needed an imported prosthesis but could not afford it. He was provided with the Indian prosthesis and he regained his voice.
