Nair Service Society (NSS) general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair on Friday mounted a frontal attack on ‘hawks’ in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who, according to him, are trying to saffronise the organisation.He was addressing the annual Akhila Kerala Nair Prathinidhi Sammelan organised prior to the 139th Mannam Jayanthi celebrations.Mr. Nair said the party leadership had not taken any steps to control this intolerant segment, though marginal in numbers. If the party took an amicable stance, instead of trying to intimidate the NSS, no other organisation could match the NSS in giving back, he said.Of various partiesHe said NSS members belonged to various political parties. But the organisation had always insisted that when they came to the NSS it should be as a Nair community member and not as any party member.Partners of the United Democratic Front (UDF) had agreed to this approach long back and those in the Left Democratic Front too had concurred with it of late.“If the BJP can desist from interfering in the internal affairs of the NSS, they too can benefit,” he said. The NSS, he said, would not form any political party nor would it be part of any coalition.Reacting to the allegation that they had not been able to build upon the basis laid by Mannathu Padmanabhan, he read out the list of organisations under the NSS now and said the blessings of the Samudaya Acharya had helped the successive leadership to build on the strong basis laid by him.He said the organisation was built on a value system based on secularism, democracy, and social justice.“This organisation was founded long before most of today’s political parties were born,” he said and added that it was unbecoming of any party to make it part of their agenda-implementation programme.Pat for UDFThe present UDF government had an open approach to NSS and implemented 22 demands made by it during the past five years.“Out of this, the demand for a holiday for Mannam Jayanthi is the only one which concerned the NSS alone. All others covered the interests of other communities as well,” he said.P.N. Narendranathan Nair, NSS president, chaired the session.
