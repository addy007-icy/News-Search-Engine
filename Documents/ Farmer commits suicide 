A farmer allegedly committed suicide by consuming pesticide at Sannamudlu, a village in Srinigeri taluk, on Tuesday. The deceased, who has been identified as Chinnappa Gowda (72), was disappointed by the loss he allegedly suffered in paddy crop. Chinnappa Gowdaâ€™s son Sathish told the Sringeri police that his father had borrowed Rs.40,000 from Kaveri Bank at Nemmar by pledging his land. Besides, he had borrowed some money from private sources to invest on the paddy cultivation. He committed suicide owing to his inability to repay the loans.
