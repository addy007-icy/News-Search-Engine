Here is good news for the residents of the district headquarters town. They will soon have a beautiful tank bund on the lines of the one in Hyderabad, near historic Indur fort in a few months.Disclosing this at a news conference here on Friday, Mayor Akula Sujatha said the State government sanctioned Rs. 6.28 crore for the development of Raghunath tank bund, for its de-siltation and construction of parks and so on at the place under Mission Kakatiya.There is a small hillock abutting the tank which houses the Central Jail built by the Nizams and a Ramalayam covered by woods giving a panoramic view to the visitors. The tank is one of the drinking water sources for the inhabitants.It may be recalled here that renowned Telugu poet Dasarathi Krishnamacharya, fondly called Dasarathi, wrote the famous lines Na Telangana Koti Rathanala Veena with charcoal on the four walls of his cell when he was incarcerated by the Nizam in this prison during the Telangana Armed Struggle.The government shifted the prison to another place near Sarangapur leaving it as a historic monument.Thanking Ministers T. Harish Rao and P. Srinivas Reddy, Member of Parliament K. Kavitha and MLA B. Ganesh Gupta for sanctioning funds for Raghunatha tank, the Mayor said they all were extending their cooperation to the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao in his efforts to make the State ‘Bangaru Telangana’.She said Rs.10 crore was sanctioned so far for the development of the town under the 14th Finance Commission Fund and Rs. 231 crore for the remaining works of underground drainage.This apart, under the AMRUTH, Rs. 100 crore would come in five years, she said. Ms. Sujatha said there will not be drinking water scarcity in summer this year in the town as the Ali Sagar reservoir, the major source of water, was filled with Nizam Sagar water recently.
