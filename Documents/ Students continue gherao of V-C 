The stalemate at the Jadavpur University continued with the Vice Chancellor (V-C) Suranjan Das now confined to his room by agitating students for more than 48 hours.The students have been agitating outside the V-C’s room since Friday, demanding that he announce dates for University student council elections though the West Bengal government had recently issued an advisory to State-run universities asking them not to hold elections to students’ unions in February as it would coincide with school board exams.Late on Sunday evening, the Governor’s office reportedly called the VC following which an emergency Executive Council meeting was held. The students then held a meeting with the V-C and student representatives said they “may announce” the outcome of the meeting later at night. The VC, who suffers from diabetes and hypertension, was examined by a doctor in the afternoon.
