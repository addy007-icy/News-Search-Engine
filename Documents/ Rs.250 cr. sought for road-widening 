The Mananchira Vellimadukunnu Road Action Committee has demanded that the State government specifically allot Rs. 250 crore in the upcoming budget for the road widening project in the city.Action committee president M.G.S. Narayanan, working president Mathew Kattikkana and general secretary M.P. Vasudevan said so far the government had sanctioned only Rs. 64 crore for the mega project in the district. A sum of Rs. 250 crore was required to acquire land for widening the 8.4 km stretch of the National Highway passing through the city.They also demanded that the government issue an order on the rehabilitation package for the 40 landowners and shopkeepers who had handed over their property to the Revenue Department for the project. An order should also be issued to acquire 87 cents of land that had been left out in the initial stages. Chief Minister Oommen Chandy during his mass contact programme in Kozhikode had promised to convert the Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu road into a four-lane carriageway. However, the dream project still remained on paper, they said.In a related development, the Revenue Department is taking steps on the utilisation of the recently released Rs. 29 crore allotted for the project. A committee chaired by the District Collector will acquire land based on the new rules framed by the government based on the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. The government had allotted Rs. 25 crore to acquire land and use the remaining Rs. 4 crore to construct a compound wall to prevent encroachments on government land falling in the alignment of the highway.
