The higher incidence of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, osteoporosis and many types of cancer are due to our changing food habits and lifestyle issues like stress, environmental pollution and sedentary habits.A proactive way to prevent disease and improve health and immunity is to increase vegetables, fruits and plant-based foods in our diet. A great way to replace dairy milk is by using nut milk. Cashew nuts or almonds are wonderful and can be used to make simple, quick and delicious nut milk. These are perfect in the form of smoothies and shakes, with tea or coffee, or even as vegan yoghurt.Ingredients1 cup cashew nuts4 cups filtered waterProcessSoak the nuts overnight in clean water. If it is too hot, refrigerate the soaked nuts, to avoid fermentation. In the morning, drain the water and rinse them well. This rids the nuts of enzyme inhibitors, making them easy to digest and more nutritious. If using a high-powered blender, put the nuts and the measured water in the jar and process.If using a traditional mixer-grinder, add the nuts in the jar, with a little water, grind to a fine paste, and keep adding more water slowly. The milk is ready. If you prefer, you can use cheesecloth to filter the milk (I donâ€™t).Store it in the fridge in a glass or steel bottle/jar. It stays fresh for five to six days.OptionalYou can follow the same proportion to make almond milk, or use cashews and sesame seeds in a 3:1 ratio too.If you like drinking the milk straight, you could add a couple of dates while making the milk.In terms of adding different flavours, an all-time favourite is cacao powder, dates and a pinch of sea salt.Enjoy!
