In a massive year-long crackdown on persons employing children for begging, the Mumbai police have registered a record number of cases and arrests as compared with the past five years.As per official data, the Mumbai police registered 208 cases against offenders under Sections 5 (summary inquiry in respect of persons found begging and their detention), 9 (court may order detention of persons wholly dependent on beggar), 11 (penalty for employing or causing persons to beg or using them for purposes of begging) of the Maharashtra Prevention of Begging Act and Section 24 (employment of juvenile or child for begging) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.While in 2010, no cases was registered, by 2014 the registration of offences increased to 29, making a huge leap in 2015. Similarly, 207 offenders were arrested in 2015 whereas none were arrested in 2010. In 2014, 29 offenders were arrested.The number of rescued children has also been going up steadily. In 2015, the police tracked and rescued 457 children who were engaged in begging.Mumbai police spokesperson DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni said, “The spike in numbers is a result of a special drive by the Mumbai police in tracking missing children. We worked closely with NGOs and child rights groups. The Central government has issued guidelines to all the States to track missing children as they are mostly pushed into begging.”The Union Home Ministry had directed States and Union Territories to launch Operation Smile campaign from January 2015 and Operation Muskan in July 2015 to rescue and rehabilitate missing children.
