They honed their skills at Gymkhana Ground way back in late 80s during the formative stages that eventually turned out to be outstanding careers in the world of hockey. And, when triple Olympian Nandnuri Mukesh Kumar and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics goalkeeper Edwards Alloysius saw the top official of Sports Authority of Telangana A. Dinakar Babu, VC & MD of SAT, wield the hockey stick for a few minutes at the same venue on Wednesday’, they could not be faulted if they hoped for the ground to be in much better shape in the days to come.For, even during the Super Cup invitation tournament finals a few minutes earlier, the element of risk of getting injured was pretty obvious because of the uneven ground and long, rough patches. Clearly, the venue needs a facelift as it happens to be the only one in the city which is accessible for the average hockey player too.The Begumpet Police Stadium with astro-turf is confined to history as the police have taken complete charge of the venue. For the record, SAI Hostel is now located at Gachibowli Stadium where two astro-turf grounds are available.“The Gymkhana Ground looks much better now. And, I assure you all that it will look even better in the days to come,” insisted the top SAT Official Dinakar Babu.What with Mukesh, who has taken over as Secretary of Hockey Telangana (affiliated to the official national body Hockey India), announcing that the Chief Minister’s Cup will be held in Karimnagar next month and also a series of tournaments in the city to give a fillip to the sport, Gymkhana badly needs better attention.“It will be great if hockey comes back to this venue with a bang. For this is where we learned the nuances of the sport from coaches like late Abharanam sir and Doraiswamy sir,” reminds Alloysius. The few times the SAT top officials summoned the engineering head to give the estimates in this regard, it remained only on paper! And the scarcity of maintenance staff at the sprawling Gymkhana which also caters to football, basketball, handball, tennis and cricket (only nets) is a hurdle in focusing more on the hockey venue alone.
