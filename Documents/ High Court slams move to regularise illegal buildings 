The Bombay High Court today came down heavily on the Maharashtra government for proposing to formulate a policy regularising all illegal constructions in Navi Mumbai despite it ordering action against the builders.A division bench of Justices A S Oka and C V Bhadang was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations over illegal constructions on land belonging to City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) in Navi Mumbai.Government pleader Abhinandan Vagyani on Thursday informed the High Court that a draft policy has been formed by which the illegal constructions will be regularised. Irked with this, the court said, “What signal are you sending by doing this? Under what statutory powers you are regularising buildings that have been illegally constructed on land belonging to Cidco and MIDC?”“You (government) are trying to gain political sympathy but we are thinking about the law. Today you are regularising structures in Navi Mumbai, tomorrow other areas like Vasai-Virar, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Bhiwandi will also come forward. What will you do then?” the Bench asked.The High Court asked if the government has considered the consequences of its decision to regularise the illegal buildings.The High Court has posted the petitions for further hearing next week by when the government will have to make its stand clear. —PTI
