Interrogation of four youths from Uttarakhand, arrested for their alleged links to global terror outfit Islamic State (IS), has allegedly revealed that their target was very specific — the Ardh Kumbh Mela at Har Ki Pauri ghat of the Ganga in the holy town.Earlier, the police had claimed that some “strategic locations” here. However, police sources said on Thursday that the arrested quartet changed their claim subsequently. “It was only Har ki Pauri that the group had planned to launch attacks on using bombs made of phosphorous extracted from matchsticks. The area of the venue is limited and the number of visitors high, making it extremely vulnerable,” said a police officer.He added that they initially planned to visit the mining areas of Chhattisgarh to buy explosives, but later one of them came across a design on the Internet that could help them manufacture IEDs with matchsticks as a key ingredient. The officer clarified that they had no operational connect with the IS. Akhlaq ur-Rehman, Mohammad Ajimussan, Mohammad Meraj alias Monu and Osama Mohammed alias Adil are all residents of Haridwar.
