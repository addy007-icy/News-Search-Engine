Union Minister for Urban Development M. Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said India was fast emerging as the world capital of diabetes, with each home emerging as a rice mill.Inaugurating the National Rural Sports and Games under the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan (RGKA) at the NTR Stadium here, he said unbridled rice consumption was a reason for the spread of the ailment.“Lack of physical activity and too much of dependence on electronic gadgets are making human beings unfit. The art of walking and exercising has taken a backseat. It is the responsibility of parents to inculcate good habits among children during formative years, for they can be shaped up as good and healthy individuals,” he added.The Minister said the World Health Organisation had predicted poor physical mobility as the prime reason behind rising mortality. “Sports and games are the entry points to several good things in life. A sound body and mind will make your life worth living,” he said.He exhorted young athletes from across the country to make friends, have fun, learn fair play and improve self-esteem by involving themselves passionately in sports and games. He attributed his physical fitness to badminton, which he practises for an hour every morning. “Every day, I play badminton for an hour. I am in my late sixties, and I feel fit,” he said.He said: “We should re-introduce kho kho, kabaddi, and other traditional games to children.”National Rural Sports and Games begins at Gudivada
