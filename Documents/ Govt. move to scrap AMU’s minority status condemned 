Condemning the “unnecessary interference” in the affairs of the minority character of the Aligarh Muslim University and the Jamia Millia Islamia, senior lawyers and activists on Sunday urged the Union Human Resources Development Ministry to keep away from “vote bank politics.” They strongly criticised the Centre's move the scrap the minority status of the two prominent universities.A joint resolution passed by senior lawyers, activists and groups, including the AMU Old Boys Association, termed the Centre’s plan to strip the minority status of these two varsities a “sinister vote bank politics to promote an unholy agenda and dilute special character of these two premier seats of learning.”They also termed as a “highly condemnable act” the interference of the MHRD in the internal affairs of the Hyderabad University, which “resulted in the death” of Dalit scholar Rohit Vemula.The resolution, which was passed at a seminar in Allahabad, also condemned and termed as “unconstitutional” the remarks of Attorney General of India Muku Rohatgi that the AMU and JMI were not minority educational institutions. In his opinion to the MHRD Ministry, Mr. Rohatgi had quoted a 1967 Supreme Court judgment, which had that AMU was technically not a minority institution as it was and the same principle applied to Jamia Millia Islamia. The two instutions were set up by an Act of Parliament and not by Muslims, was the argument presented.“The interference in routine internal affairs of any university by the MHRD is against the mission for which the MHRD) was created on September 26, 1985, through the 174th amendment to the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961,” the resolution noted.Attended by prominent lawyers of the Allahabad High Court, the signatories included Zafaryab Zilani, additional advocate general of the government of Uttar Pradesh and convenor of the Babri Action Committee.The MHRD and the government of India must “comply and follow its own reasoning which were raised before the Supreme Court while the SLPs were filed on its behalf against the judgment of Allahabad High Court.Any change in the stand of government will undermine the majesty of law and will affect overall atmosphere in the country, the lawyers said.This comes even as the Opposition parties have joined hands to oppose the Centre's move to scrap the minority status of the two institutions.
