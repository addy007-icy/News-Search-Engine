Network of Women in Media in India (NWMI), a network of women journalists, has urged the editor of national news agency, Press Trust of India, not to allow a senior journalist accused of serial sexual harassment to write for it till he is cleared of all charges.In a letter to M.K. Razdan, editor-in-chief of PTI, the NWMI has noted that to allow a tainted journalist to write for the agency, without getting a clean chit from the authorities was unhealthy and would tarnish its name. The copy of the letter was released here on Friday."For a respected organisation such as yours, which represents the fourth estate of our democracy, it is indeed a shame if persons like accused on bail Rupesh Samant continue to thrive as journalists while inquiries into accusations of serious crimes like the sexual harassment of women colleagues at their workplace are still ongoing," the letter said.The letter has noted that four First Information Reports had been filed against Samant between September and October 2015 at the Women's Police Station in Panaji which allege sexual harassment of women working in a local news channel Herald Cable News, where he was the editor, apart from also working for PTI as its Goa bureau chief.The crimes were registered under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 and Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (Criminal Law Amendment, 2013).The NWMI’s letter which took prompt note of a written plea made to it by Goa Union of Journalists (GUJ), body of working journalists, traced the chronology of events in the case and said that pleas for anticipatory bail filed by the lawyers of Samant were dismissed by a court in Mapusa, Goa, on October 14, 2015, and the Bombay High Court in Goa on October 30, 2015, before he was arrested after being non-traceable for nearly 45 days.While releasing him on bail, the trial court had also asked the senior journalist not to contact the offices of HCN and PTI as a bail condition and to be present for probe at the women's police station in the city on every Saturday."However, he has been sending out news and representing your organisation as a “contributor” by proxy, even though, as has been made clear by PTI officials to the GUJ," NWMI said in its letter to Mr. Razdan.
