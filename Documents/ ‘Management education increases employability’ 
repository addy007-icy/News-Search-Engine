“Management education increases the employability of graduates of any discipline,” V.G. Chary, management educator and vice-president of Hyderabad-based Siv Sivani Institute of Management, said here on Friday.At a seminar to create awareness on management education and international courses offered by business schools in India, he said that management institutes train students in problem solving, which was considered a highly valued skill by corporate companies and other employers.Dr. Chary traced the evolution of the Indian economy over the decades and said that India’s sustained growth rate had given it an edge even beyond bigger economies like China and the US.A recent report had said that higher growth and job creation would be possible only in India, Mexico, Turkey and a few other countries in the coming years, he added.
