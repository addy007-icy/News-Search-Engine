India may consider launching its humanitarian efforts for the war-affected in Syria from a base in neighbouring Jordan, officials have said.The proposal is likely to feature in the talks to be held on Tuesday between visiting Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.“India has already extended half-a-million dollar assistance to Syrian refugees based in Jordan, as per the third Pledging Conference on Syria held in March 2015 in Kuwait,” explained an official, indicating that groundwork for greater Indian involvement in Syria has been underway for sometime.Mr Al-Moallem, who is in Delhi reportedly to seek more intense Indian participation in the international peace process for Syria, is also expected to convey the Syrian desire to get India on board for a long-term recovery plan for his country. “While the immediate needs are for paramedics, doctors, artificial limbs and medicine supply, we also require India to help Syria in creating political reconciliation at home, as all sides in the conflict appreciate the constructive position India has maintained regarding the civil war,” said New Delhi-based Syrian commentator Dr. Waiel Awwad. The Hindu had earlier reported that South Block was “not interested” in widespread security cooperation to contain the ISIS phenomenon, as India traditionally avoided such security operations without the explicit support of the United Nations.Diplomatic sources told The Hindu that while India did not want to be involved in security operations inside Syria, it wanted to ensure “zero-risk atmosphere” for Indian companies and medical teams to help them work for Syrian projects. “Border tribes are same on both sides of the Syria-Jordan international boundary and local tribal leaders and the Jordanian government can provide an additional safety mechanism for Indians working in Syrian projects.”According to sources, the visit by Mr Al-Moallem to India acquired significance as the Syrian government chose India as the first destination for Mr. Moallem immediately after President Bashar Al Assad agreed to participate in the Geneva talks scheduled for later this month. “Mr Al Moallem’s trip is also a recognition of India’s cautious position on Syria,” said Mr. Awwad.
