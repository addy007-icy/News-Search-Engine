We have heard of coastal foods. We have had Goan dishes, flavours from Kerala and the delights from the coasts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. How about a food fest that offers all the flavours from the coasts is at Dakshin restaurant in ITC Kakatiya is a fest that does exactly that.Instead of hosting different flavours from the coasts individually, the fest brings a combination, making it easy and offering a wide variety to diners to choose from. Since Karavali is about the coastal region, the menus that change every two days has a mix of various flavours. In a bid to offer more choice for diners, the chef has miniature dosas for starters. The best of these bite-sized dosas is the banana flavoured one. The kuzhi paniyaram is a small ball of slightly roasted dough. Crispy outside and soft inside. On offer are dishes like ulavacharu biryani, ulavacharu chicken, mix veg stew to be served wth idiyappam, mamsam vepudu and shrimps  balchao (shrimps  spiced with peppercorn and malt vinegar), nandu  calicut  (crab  roasted  with  spicy onion tomato chilli and coconut masala).Also a must try or rather the chef’s recommendation is the manji kolavaithina (whole white Pomfret marinated with green chilli, ginger lemon and wrapped in a banana leaf and baked). Also to be featured during the period are cuisines from the homes of the Malayalees of Kerala, Bunts of Mangalore, Coorgis of Karnataka and the Portugese of Goa.Go overboard on the desserts but save a little idiyappam to dip your payasam into. The combination not only tones down the sweetness of the payasam but also tastes heavenly!
