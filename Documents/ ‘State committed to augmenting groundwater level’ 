Transport Minister Sidda Raghava Rao has exhorted the farmers to join hands with the State government which has taken an ambitious programme to dig farm ponds in a big way to overcome moisture stress during dry spells by augmenting groundwater levels.Taking part in the third phase of the Janmabhoomi-Maa Vooru programme at Malaparla and Rudra Samudram villages, he said the government was committed to make farming profitable by ensuring assured irrigation even at times of drought by digging one lakh farm ponds in the drought-prone district by roping in farm labourers under the MG-NREGS scheme.He emphasised the need for improving storage capacity of water tanks to harvest the rain water and drought-proof the State by ensuring an average groundwater level of eight metres before rains and three metres during rainy season.Despite the precarious financial position, the Chandrababu Naidu government had implemented welfare schemes to the tune of Rs. 46,000 crore. No other government had dared to implement the farm loan waiver scheme on a scale implemented in the State, he added.
