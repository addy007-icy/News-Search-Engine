Former Australian captain and television pundit Mark Taylor was spot on while summing up the five-match ODI series before he called upon the man-of-the-match, Manish Pandey, player-of-the-series, Rohit Sharma, and the two captains, MS Dhoni and Steve Smith for the customary post-match ceremony. He said the series was dominated by the batsmen and 3159 runs were scored.Most observers of the game are far from surprised by the batsmen-friendly pitches rolled out for the series because they had seen it all during last year’s World Cup in Australia. The idea was always to make sure that the ball did not seam excessively off the wicket, bounce alarmingly and not afford turn to the spinners — the reason why the Indian tour management did not find a place for off-spinner R. Ashwin (9-0-68-2 at Perth and 10-0-60-0 at Brisbane) in all five matches, especially after he went wicketless in the second ODI at Brisbane.Australia itself did not choose a specialist spinner for the first three matches at Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne, and off-spinner Nathan Lyon had an eminently forgettable match at Canberra (10-0-76-1) and Sydney (8-0-58-0). In fact, Lyon has played only 10 ODI matches for Australia as against 52 Test matches in which he has taken 185 wickets at 33.42.Emphasis on batsmenIn fact, spinners plying the trade of turning the ball from off to leg has not been a real hit or game-changer in ODIs played in Australia; the emphasis has always been to choose a batsman who can also bowl a few overs of off-spin like Andrew Symonds, Marlon Samuels, David Hussey and Glenn Maxwell. Australia’s Peter Taylor is the highest wicket-taker with 77 in 61 matches. Most off-spinners among the 123 (824 wickets in 1786 matches) have cost their team heavily on Australian pitches with the average being 38.35.The 54 left-arm spinners who have bowled in ODIs in Australia have been inferior, taking just about 402 wickets in 848 matches at an average of 40.87. Former Australian captain Allan Border is the highest with 37 wickets in the 177 matches he played at home. Here again, teams have managed with all-rounders like Darren Lehmann, Ravi Shastri, Michael Clarke and Sanath Jayasuriya.Juxtaposed against the finger spinners, the wrist spinners have obtained good purchase on the hard pitches that afford bounce, and in all 41 leg-spinners have taken 371 wickets in 542 matches at an impressive average of 32.98.The leader of the leg-spin group is the mesmerising Shane Warne with 136 wickets in 85 matches at 24.24 and with a strike rate of 34.93 and economy rate of 69.40. He is followed by three Pakistanis — Shahid Afridi, Mushtaq Ahmed and Abdul Qadir. India’s Anil Kumble has taken 14 wickets in 13 ODI matches in Australia. As against the spinners, the fast bowlers and their ilk have taken over 5000 wickets in ODIs played in Australia.Is the trend changing?Is the trend changing with the pitches being made for the batsmen to explode into action in order to provide entertainment? In the five-match series, India deployed 11 bowlers and took 27 wickets at 57.78 with a strike rate of 54.93 and economy rate of 105.19, while Australia used 10 bowlers and took 28 wickets at 55.43, with a strike rate of 53.36 and economy rate of 103.88.John Hastings was the highest-wicket taker with 10 in four matches at 21.50, but James Faulkner, who played all five matches, finished with five wickets at a costly 57.80, while Mitchell Marsh took three at 65.67.For India, apart from Ishant Sharma (nine wickets at 27.78 in four matches) and Jasprit Bumrah (2 wickets at 20 in one match, at Sydney), none did anything to shout about. Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja took three wickets in five matches at 96.Of the bowlers, Ashwin, who has a decent ODI record overseas, has played seven ODIs against Australia in Australia and has returned only four wickets at 91, while Jadeja has played 11 against Australia in Australia and taken only four wickets at 111.75. They got no purchase from the pitch.Gujarat’s Axar Patel will wonder why he was not given a chance when Gurkeerat Mann and Rishi Dhawan were given three chances each.
