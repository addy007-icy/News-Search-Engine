The next time a traffic cop approaches you with a hand-held device, chances are high that it would be thrust to the rear of the car rather than on your face. In view of the increasing pollution levels in the city, the Hyderabad Traffic Police have decided to take matters into their own hands by punishing vehicle owners for spewing out more toxics. In a month from now, these portable devices will be distributed to traffic officials across the city.“We will take up the initiative by working in tandem with the Transport and Pollution Control Board authorities,” said AV Ranganath, DCP, Traffic-2, Hyderabad Traffic Police. “We have seen that pollution levels are very high in cities like Delhi and the State government is taking some measures to curb it. Hyderabad is not very far as it is one of the highly polluted cities in the country and tackling the issue is crucial for sustainable development.”According to Mr. Ranganath, it has been observed that the pollution certification vans are either faulty or fraud and most often do not give out correct certificates. As a result, the vehicular pollution is reaching high proportions in the absence of proper checks, he added.The tendering process to procure the devices will begin in a few days. The device will work similar to that of breath analyser equipment. It will have a SIM card provision and will be connected to a command and control centre. The device will be programmed in such a way that pollution readings above permissible limits are captured and shown as a violation.The officials plan to start the drive in busy traffic junctions, parking areas or even during drunken driving checks.In case of a first time violation, the owner or driver of the car will be fined an amount of Rs. 1,000 as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act.
