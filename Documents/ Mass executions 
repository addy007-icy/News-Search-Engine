The establishment in Saudi Arabia represents one of the most repressive regimes around the world (‘World’ – “Saudi Arabia will face divine retribution: Khamenei”, Jan.4). It has been given a long rope by energy-starved nations that otherwise value human rights and accord equality to their minorities. That it is also the site of some of the most holy places in the Islamic world is also used to its advantage. Some like India do not want to displease the monarchs for the sake of the large expatriate workforce there. It is odd that the Kingdom targets political dissenters, yet is alleged to be behind the rise of global terrorism. How long can this be tolerated?M.A. Siraj,Bengaluru
