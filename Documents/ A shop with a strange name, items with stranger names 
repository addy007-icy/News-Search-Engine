One of the highlights of this industrial city is the sweet shop which sports the strange name ‘Thaggu ke Laddu’ (Laddoo for the cheat).A favourite destination for sweet lovers, the shop which is around 45 years old came into limelight in 2007 when it first featured in the Bollywood movie “Bunty and Babli” starring Abhishek Bacchan.The life story of its founder Ram Avatar Pandey seems to resemble a Bollywood film because he says he ran from his house and came to this industrial city to earn a living. He started selling laddus from a plate.“Ram Avatar ran away from his house and started selling laddus on the streets on a plate. A few years later he went on to buy a small shop near Chandra Plaza. At present there are six outlets in the city,” says Rajesh Kumar Pandey, the present owner of ‘Thaggu ke laddu’Mr Pandey recalls an incident when Ram Avatar went to Delhi and attended a meeting of Mahatma Gandhi where he said sugar is white poison.Feeling ashamed of the fact that by making laddus of sugar he was cheating people of both their health and money, he named his shop as ‘Thaggu ke Laddu’Beside the shop, a small kulfi counter sells a range of kulfis in exotic sounding names. ‘Badnaam Kulfi’ is sold at Rs 400 per kg and is one of its famous delicacies.“We try to maintain the quality of the products here and that is the reason we have not increased the number of items being sold at the shop,” says Pandey.Famous one-liners like ‘Aisa koi Saga nahi, jisko humne thaga nahi’, ‘Mehmaan ko Chakhana nahi, tik jayega, Chakhte hi Jubaan aur jeb ki garmi gayab’ are written on the walls of the shop and have attracted celebrities from Bollywood including Rani Mukherjee and Abhishek Bacchan to TV stars such as ‘Lapataganj’.“All the one-liners were given by Ram Avatar even though he was not well read but he read newspapers from where he got all the ideas and knowledge,” says Pandey.The catchy one-liners were used in a song in the movie “Bunty and Babli”.With six branches in the city, the owners want to confine themselves to Kanpur and do not want to open branches across the country. “We won’t be able to manage all the branches together,” says Pandey.“We fear that if we do not live up to the expectation and give the same taste that we have been giving for years, then people would think that they are being cheated and they would not come to shop,” he says.Close to Lucknow, the city of Nawabs, Kanpur is a foodies’ paradise with its food being heavily influenced by the Mughals. -- PTI
