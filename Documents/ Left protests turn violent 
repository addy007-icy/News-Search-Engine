Protests by left-leaning organisations in the State capital on Thursday, demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in connection with the solar scam, turned violent after protesters pelted stones and scaled the walls of the Secretariat to enter the high security area.The protests, which began around 11 a.m. with a DYFI march towards the Secretariat from the University College side, turned violent after the police prevented the activists from getting closer to the Secretariat. With stones being pelted, the police resorted to a lathicharge.The protesters, who first ran helter-skelter, regrouped and returned, with the police then deciding to go for tear gas shells and water canons. The efforts of CPI(M) leaders, including V. Sivankutty, MLA, and district secretary Kadakampally Surendran, to pacify the protesters bore no fruit, with some of them even preventing the police from shifting the injured to hospital. About 10 activists have reported injuries in the violent episodes that stretched till noon. At least four police officers too were injured in the violence, three of them in the morning, and one during the clash between the police and activists of the Students Federation of India, who took out a protest march towards the Secretariat around 3 p.m.In a connected episode, the police arrested four activists of the All India Youth Federation, who had also taken out a march, after the four managed to get past police barricades, scale the compound wall of the Secretariat and enter the high security area. The four, who were nabbed immediately by the Cantonment police, were identified as Sajan, Rahul Raj, Al Jihan and Anwar Shah. They were produced before court later, the police said, adding that three cases were registered in connection with the dayâ€™s clashes.
