The sports-loving city may be missing as a host for the men’s matches of the forthcoming ICC World Twenty20 in India but a tyre major from the southern metropolis will ensure that Chennai’s ties with the tournament remains as strong as ever.In a function at the ITC Grand Chola here on Wednesday afternoon, MRF Limited and the International Cricket Council inked a four-year sponsorship association that includes this summer’s ICC World T20, next year’s ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC World Cup at England in 2019.Eternal favouriteOne of Chennai’s eternal favourites Sachin Tendulkar, present as MRF’s brand ambassador, lent a special touch when just before praising the ICC-MRF alliance, he drew attention to the devastating floods that ravaged the city and the manner in which it roused itself.“This is my first visit to Chennai after the floods. After landing here what I experienced was the same vibrant energy that I experienced during my many trips to Chennai before. The city is back on track. In difficult times, people from various parts of our nation extended a helping hand and a big, big thank-you to all of them, who showed the real character of the country,” the maestro said.Tendulkar also recalled the oft-repeated tale of his futile sojourn to the MRF Pace Foundation in the late ’80s when he aspired to be a fast bowler!And when it came to picking a favourite for the ICC World T20 from March 8 to April 3, there were no second thoughts as he promptly said: “It is going to be India all the way.”Dave Richardson, the ICC’s CEO, who briefly bantered about the 17-year-old (Tendulkar) from the early ’90s, still looking fit, said: “This, of course, isn’t a new partnership as MRF was associated with us as a global sponsor for the ICC World Cup in Australia in 2015.”He, however, did clarify that this wasn’t a co-branding exercise and mentioned that the company is one among the global partners of the ICC.Valuable roleMeanwhile, MRF Limited’s Chairman and Managing Director K.M. Mammen said: “It is good to be associated with the ICC and cricket has been synonymous with MRF for decades right from the inception of the MRF Pace Foundation.”The trophies meant for the ICC World T20 (men and women) were also displayed.
