Brought to life following a three-month-long residency in Aya Nagar in the city and then transferred to a gallery space, “Portraits from Within” is an installation by Mario d’Souza, an artist who grew up in India but has been living in France for over a decade.The self-portrait explores the duality in the artist’s life of retaining strong ties to Indian culture and moving to France to work as an artist. The artist’s life is much like what the institution Alliance Francaise (where the installation is on display) seeks to stand for.With colours inspired by a number of “Baramasa” miniature paintings that he randomly picked up from an earlier visit to the city, Mario extracts the main colour palette from the painting and creates a series of sketches to go with the original miniature that is inspired by the flora and fauna around, shared culture and history to create a series of installations. The central installation, which is created using plastic straws, tubes and sponge, spins a web across the gallery. Mario says “I have chosen to work with materials that are hollow and have air in them. Even the frames for the paintings and sketches have air in them. The air within the material represents movement and the breathing space to live that represents in some way the duality of my life and the freedom to move.”Talking about the life of an artist in India and in France, Mario says he is basically a community-based artist and pays to work in France among various communities. This gives him the sustainability to express himself and experiment and to do work that is not necessarily saleable but done for the emotion of creation and therapy and not with the objective to make money.The exhibition is on till February 6 at Gallerie Romain Rolland.The artist seeks to combine the two influences in his life as an artist to speak a language that is manifested through his art
