Former Delhi High Court Judge Justice Mukul Mudgal, appointed as observer for the fourth cricket test match between India and South Africa here last month, on Monday pointed to several deficiencies in the functioning of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), while affirming that no tangible action seems to have been taken on the issues raised.In his 27-page report submitted to a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, Justice Mudgal said the DDCA’s internal audit had revealed shortcomings and financial irregularities in its last report, and unless corrective action was taken, “these shortcomings will continue.”While allowing holding of test match at Feroze Shah Kotla Cricket Stadium here from December 3 to 7, the High Court had appointed Justice Mudgal, who is also the former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to oversee the affairs of the match. The DDCA had moved the court against South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s denial of permission to organise the match.The report listed as many as 11 deficiencies in preparation of the match and functioning of the DDCA. The work for preparing the report was carried out under financial supervision of the former Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General, J.P. Singh.Even as there was “no transparency” in the assigning of duties by the DDCA, there were deficiencies in tendering system, record keeping, delay in payment of bills, allotment of corporate boxes and naming of pavilions and stands, finance, defunct sub-committees, ticketing, broadcasting, media and permissions, according to the report.The Bench comprising Justice S. Muralidhar and Justice Vibhu Bakhru, to whom the report was submitted, posted the matter for further hearing on February 2.As per the internal auditor’s report, Rs.5.56 crore was lying with the accounts department of the DDCA pending approval by the management, which was a highly undesirable situation, stated the report, adding that the balance sheet for 2014-15 was yet to be finalised.However, the DDCA generated a surplus of Rs.19,80,653 from the test match, according to the provisional statement of income and expenditure, noted Justice Mudgal.He also made 17 recommendations to ensure improvement in the functioning of the DDCA. They included inviting of open tenders, maintenance of proper records, review of internal controls, removal of ad hocism, bringing down the number of complimentary passes and availability of tickets at reasonable rates.He was appointed observer for fourth test match between India, South Africa last month
