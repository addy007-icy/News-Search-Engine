Coimbatore’s Smart Cities selection and winning proposal for developing eight tanks, the areas around them, arterial and other roads and taking up other projects has drawn widespread appreciation.The city’s selection is to be welcomed but how the Corporation goes about implementing the proposal to restore the eight tanks remains to be seen, says Vanitha Mohan, Managing Trustee of Siruthuli, the NGO engaged in water body conservation.The move to use the water bodies for creation and allow boating facilities are the areas of concern. Given the importance of water bodies in recharging groundwater in the city, resources should be spent only on preserving those. Ms. Mohan said the Corporation’s move to build rainwater-harvesting structures could be a game-changer for the city, if implemented properly.Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore Honorary Secretary R. Raveendran said that the restoration and cleaning of tanks would be of little consequences if the civic body did not pay attention to the inlet channels. The Smart Cities proposal was the second big-ticket project after JNNURM, which was welcome. But the way the Corporation had executed the project made one doubtful of the outcome of the project, said K. Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause. Urban Designer Sarfaraz S. Yaseen said that the Corporation should rope in experts in the implementation of the project. For, it was important to be a city with difference in implementing the projects as well.Architect Arun Prasad said that the Corporation should focus on forming a project management committee to ensure quality and timely completion of projects.
