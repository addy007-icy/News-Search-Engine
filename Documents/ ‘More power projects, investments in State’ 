On Saturday, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa got the most applause in the Assembly for her statement on the turnaround in the energy sector in the State.“When I assumed power in 2011, the greatest challenge before me was power cut. The previous DMK regime had taken Tamil Nadu to the age of darkness. People were facing unprecedented power cuts for several hours,” she said.From June 5, 2015, there has been no power cut. The turnaround could be achieved by expediting projects for capacity addition of 4455.5 MW, she said to loud desk thumping by ruling party members. Besides, MoUs were signed for long-term power purchase of 3,330 MW of which 2,830 MW was being realised now. Including energy from other sources, there has been an addition of 7,485.5 MW since May 2011, she said. In another six months, 1,232 MW more would be added.On investments, Ms. Jayalalithaa said the Global Investors Meet 2015 alone attracted FDI which was more than what was received in the 20-year period beginning 1991. Of the 33 MoUs signed before GIM, 29 companies have set up shops, she noted. Moreover, the investment in MSME sector has increased by 555 per cent compared to the previous DMK regime.The State has also achieved a 68.48 per cent growth in foodgrains production over the past five years.
