A seminar on road safety organised here recently by the Transport, Police, and School Education Departments sensitised 1,200 drivers of school buses and attenders to nuances of safe driving.Though speed governors limiting the speed to 50 km per hour have been fixed in the vans and buses, the programme was considered necessary to further fine tune the skills of the drivers.The emphasis was as much on the condition of the vehicles as on the physical and mental health of the drivers. The Correspondents were told that the eyes of the drivers must be checked once a year, and that the Transport Department would do its part to sponsor spectacles for those who could not afford the expenditure.Officials told the drivers in no uncertain terms that using mobile phones while driving will not be tolerated. Drivers were instructed hand over their phones to the attendants while on the move. Acknowledging the hindrances caused by road conditions and vehicular traffic congestion, officials advised drivers to start a little earlier.The seminar that featured a short film on safe driving was addressed by Erode Revenue Divisional Officer Narmada Devi, Chief Educational Officer P. Ayyannan, Perundurai DSP Bhaskaran, Erode Traffic DSP Kodiselvam, and three RTOs Ramalinam, Lakshmanasamy and Venkatesan.
