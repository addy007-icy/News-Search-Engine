The QCEPL has completed site inspection in January 2015 and is now holding talks with the government departments concerned. “The talks between QCEPL and Navayuga Construction Company are at a crucial stage to use the Machilipatnam port for importing coal needed for the proposed thermal power plant,” sources told The Hindu, quoting the QCEPL representative Gowtham Sarma.The QCEPL, which plans to spare at least eight coal mines in Australia for production of 5,800 MW of thermal power here, has reportedly proposed to set up the power plant in 3,000 acres along the coastline.
