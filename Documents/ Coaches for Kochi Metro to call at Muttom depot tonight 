A technical team from Alstom will arrive here to oversee the unloading of the first lot of three Kochi metro coaches that are expected to arrive at the Muttom coach depot on Saturday night.They will bring along specialised equipment for unloading the coaches from the three special-purpose trailers that crossed into Kerala from Tamil Nadu through Walayar check-post on Friday morning. The first coach will be unloaded on Sunday noon, and the other two on Monday.A team of officials from the Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) led by Mohammed Najeeb, a Regional Transport Officer who is on deputation from the Motor Vehicles Department, was at the check-post to speed up paper work on Friday. The trailers were then parked at Kanjikode.The 62-wheeler trailers bearing the wrapped coaches began their journey from Alstom’s coach-manufacturing unit at Sri City in Andhra Pradesh on January 2, halting during the daytime to avoid traffic snarls. Initially, they were expected to arrive in the city on January 12.A team of technicians from Alstom is already there at the coach depot for establishing power supply stations and for laying the third rail from which the coaches will source power. “Another team is scheduled to fly down to Kochi to oversee unloading into the unloading ramp, for which special cranes will be used. The unloaded coaches will be taken to the inspection bay, where they will be tested and then coupled together for test runs. Another round of tests will be done to verify whether the mechanical, electrical and other systems have been properly coupled,” metro sources said.The coaches will be formally unveiled on January 23 by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, following which test runs will commence on the 975-metre-long test track.
