For the first time in the last eight years, AP Excise and Prohibition Department cracked down on the illicit liquor centres located in AP-Odisha border. The excise teams could not enter tribal areas which were controlled by arrack mafia since 2008, thanks to physical attacks on officials and staff.With the directive from Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham and Superintendent of Police A.S. Khan, the excise teams attacked the illicit arrack brewing centres in places like China Kosta, Peda Kosta, Kanchili and Ampuram.The enforcement teams headed by Assistant Commissioner of Prohibition and Excise Department M.Shiva Prasad and Assistant Prohibition and Excise Superintendent B. Srinivasulu conducted surprise raids on the illicit arrack centres and destroyed 4,000 litres of fermented wash and raw material including black jaggery.“Supply of illicit liquor becomes a major problem in many mandals including Sompeta, Itchapuram, Mandasa, Bhamini, Kotturu and other places.Mafia roleThe mafia, which makes and supplies arrack, is not allowing excise teams to enter the villages all along AP-Odisha border. Now with the concrete support from Odisha administration, we could destroy wash and equipment,” said Mr. Srinivasulu.According to him, the illicit liquor is being supplied from places like Konda Beejapur, Cheediga, and Gondi Masai. The Excise Department felt that constant support from Odisha officials would act as a deterrent and prevent sale of illicit liquor in border areas.
