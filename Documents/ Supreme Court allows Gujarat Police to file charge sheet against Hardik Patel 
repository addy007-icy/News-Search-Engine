The Supreme Court has allowed the Gujarat police to file a charge sheet by Friday against Patel quota agitation leader Hardik Patel for allegedly instigating the Patel community to kill policemen and adopt violent means to “wage war against the Gujarat government.”The order came when Attorney-General Mukul Rohatgi sought permission to file the charge sheet on the ground that if it was not filed, the accused would be entitled to get bail. However, a Bench of Justices J.S. Khehar and C. Nagappan refused to look into the draft charge sheet of the police, saying it would be inappropriate to do so.The court fixed January 14 for further hearing in the matter. It will also hear another plea of Mr. Patel against a High Court decision declining to quash the sedition charge against him.
