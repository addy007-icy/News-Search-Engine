The State government is considering building a convention centre, possibly one of the biggest facilities of its kind in the country, in the neighbouring Palghar district.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has asked the Chief Secretary to prepare a report on the project’s feasibility, which will be submitted by January 31.State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Tuesday said that the idea of building the biggest convention centre had been going on for months and finally, the State had initiated the process for the same. “We are currently in the process of identifying land for the project. A 1,200-acre plot in Palghar district has been shortlisted. The Chief Minister has asked the Chief Secretary to come up with a feasibility report,” said Mr Mungantiwar.Boost to tourismHe added that the convention centre could be a big boost for the tourism industry of the State as well as the corporate sector. Following the feasibility report submitted by the Chief Secretary, the State is likely to swing into action with further plans. Interestingly, a big convention centre at the Bandra-Kurla Complex is coming up, which is being constructed by the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).The State’s decision to set up yet another mammoth convention centre has raised eyebrows.Explaining his rationale behind proposing Palghar, Mr Mungatiwar said that the government wanted more programmes to be held in Maharashtra, which would ultimately improve the tourism sector. “It has been observed that tourists and foreign visitors land in Mumbai, but choose other States for their stay. We are losing out on huge revenue. If we manage to attract companies, corporates to hold their exhibitions in this centre, it will ultimately be a financial boost for the State,” he said.
