In almost all her work, nature is considered sacred. It has been that way for Parul Mehra for more than a decade now. She started her career as an architect but found her true calling many years later as an artist.“Nature is a living thing and it is watching us. It has always affected us. It has always been my endeavour to make people aware of their surroundings from an artistic point of view and for me to put all this on the canvas are the early hours of the day when I am in a state of meditation,” says Parul, who came up with a solo exhibition “A New Dialogue” in the Capital’s Alliance Francaise. Armed with more than 30 beautiful pieces of art she won the hearts of many art lovers.Every morning when women are busy with household chores or rushing to catch public transport to go to their offices, Parul invariably picks up her paint and brush and gets down to work on her canvas. For nearly five hours she gives expression to her creativity by painting scenes of nature. If in some paintings she shows Mother Earth as a living entity, in another painting she shows the Turbulence Under The Ocean and Cloudburst.Explaining how she developed interest in arts, Parul says painting was always her passion. “At an early stage I started off. As a little girl it was more like a hobby but when I entered college it became more serious.”Art was a big part of her education. “I had professors who taught me art till the third year. I started my career as an architect but later shifted to my passion.” Though well trained, Parul works according to her mood. Says Parul, “Doing a painting depends on the frame of mind I am in at that particular time. My mood can be seen in my paintings. My journey up until now has been an interesting one, meeting new folks at my art events, has given me insight into the minds of my audience and how people perceive art.”
