Market benchmark Sensex today fell to a 20-month low after plunging 266.67 points to 24,188.37, dragged down by a massive dip in exports, while RIL cracked over 5 per cent on crude slipping below $ 28 per barrel.Moreover, muted earnings and widening trade deficit to $ 11.6 billion in December as against $ 9.1 billion in the year-ago period, further battered the market mood, which is already rattled by depreciating rupee and concerns over health of the Chinese economy.Contracting for a 13th month in a row, Indian merchandise exports shrank 14.75 per cent in December to $ 22.2 billion due to a steep fall in shipment of petroleum products.Oil prices, meanwhile, dipped to $ 27.67, its lowest since 2003 after lifting of sanctions now allows Iran to resume crude exports.Resuming lower at 24,400.78, the Sensex quickly rebounded to the day’s high of 24,524.85 at the outset on spurt in Tata Steel, Wipro and Hero MotoCorp.However, it later slipped and touched a low of 24,141.99 before ending 266.67 points or 1.09 per cent lower at 24,188.37.
