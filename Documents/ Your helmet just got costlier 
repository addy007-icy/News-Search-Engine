Not one to miss an opportunity to make a quick buck, helmet stores and vendors are cashing in on the State government’s decision to make it mandatory for pillion riders to wear protective head gear.Many vendors are planning to increase the price of helmets by anywhere between 10 per cent and 25 per cent.Already, helmets that were once available in the Rs. 5,000 range are selling for about Rs 6,000. Even cheaper helmets, priced around Rs. 300, are being sold at a higher rate.Viresh Gupta, proprietor of Om Sai Helmet Palace in Okalipuram, said he will increase prices based on demand. “On an average, we sell 15 helmets every day. We have a stock of around 500 helmets. We will procure more once we see an increase in the demand,” he said, justifying the hike on the grounds that he will have to procure fresh stock at short notice.Beating the hikeDue to the increase in price, customers are looking for deals on online shopping portals. Saurav V., a software professional, had placed an order online keeping the cost factor in mind.Abhram Thomas, a helmet vendor in Frazer Town, said, “I have planned to hike rates by 25 per cent, but I am not sure if there will be a huge demand, as many people might have more than one helmet and the pillion rider may use the spare helmet.”Raju J., who runs Helmet Junction in Kengeri, anticipates an increase in sales due to the notification and has placed an order for fresh stock with a wholesaler in New Delhi. “We expect our stock to be sold out in the coming week,” he said.Vendors are warning customers against buying helmets that do not have an ISI mark. They are comparatively cheaper, but may not be safe, they claimed.
