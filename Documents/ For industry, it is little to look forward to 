For trade and industry, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections scheduled for next month remains of interest largely from a perspective of property tax.Beyond the levy, trade licence and political affiliations, there is little to look forward to from the polls for the representatives.Though theirs could be a major influence given the number of people employed in the establishments, trade and industry prefers to maintain a neutral stance.Property taxThe vote bank as well as issues in local body elections are different, explains Anil Reddy Vennam, president, Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.On matters of concern, he puts property tax on top. “It pinches a lot,” he says, citing vacant land tax as another issue.Noting that property tax on commercial properties is not a poll plank and “nobody [thus] makes any promise,” he agrees that the Corporation Council also has limited powers. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he hopes, would look into the vacant land tax issue.While the levies remain common ground, there also are specific expectations. Solution to the parking woes in commercial areas is something Ammanabolu Prakash, president, Telangana State Federation of Textile Associations, emphasises.“In the absence of parking areas, how do you expect people to shop and traders to do business,” he asks, adding that a lot more needs to be done to improve the condition of smaller roads.Bulk Drug Manufacturers’ Association general secretary R.K. Agrawal says that the elections to GHMC may be of interest to only those industry members with political affiliations.Relocation of pharma unitsOn the proposed relocation of pharma units out of the city limits and possibility of that figuring in the elections, he says it is a larger issue and would happen after the Pharma City Hyderabad takes shape.Such shifting is not an easy task, adds Mr. Vennam. It ought to be a gradual process beginning with the units setting up their new facilities at the Pharma City and then relocating entirely.Property tax on commercial properties is not a poll plank and thus nobody thus makes any promise– Anil Reddy VennamPresident, Federation of TS and AP Chambers of CommerceSolution to parking woes in commercial areas is important.
