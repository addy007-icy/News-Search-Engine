Palayam, known for age-old premises like Public Library, College of Fine Arts, VJT Hall, and University College, is also home to trees that have braved weathers to live on.May be why the stretch in the heart of the city was chosen as the venue of the third Senior Tree Citizens Walk organised by Tree Walk, an informal group of tree lovers, in the city on Sunday.It was the first walk of the group in the new year.It was aimed at documenting the diverse trees in the area and highlighting the need to plan cities in a way that such old and rare trees are valued for their heritage, Tree Walk said.The walk began on the Public Library campus where a tree known as Neerkadambu or Kaim stands.Tree Walk members said they had not seen the tree anywhere else in the city.Tree savedWhen plans to build a new building on the premises seemed to put the tree in peril a couple of years ago, Tree Walk had written to the library authorities, and their plea seemed to have borne results, for the building construction is well under way but the tree stands.War memorialAt the War Memorial is a huge tree called myrobalan, probably one of the last ones.In front of a textile chain showroom is a rain tree that too stands following the intervention of the group. As it is difficult to determine the age of many trees here, it is the narratives of people that help decide how long they have been standing. In this instance, one of the tree lovers spoke about how the rain tree had been planted by his father.A thing of beautyFurther on, in front of the Saphalyam Complex, fragrant white blooms on a jasmine tree are a beautiful sight.Behind the complex stands a mahogany with small leaves, which is different from the usual mahogany.Another such tree stands near the first gate of the Secretariat.An Indian cedar, known as Chandanavembu, can be seen on the University College campus.The tropical tree, according to a narrative by the mother of a member, was small when she joined the college in 1957.On the VJT Hall premises, one can come across male and female velvet apple trees that are estimated to be at least 50 years old.
