A public interest litigation moved in the Delhi High Court by the child rights group Bachpan Bachao Andolan has sought directions for time-bound trial and disposal of cases related to sexual offences, especially against children. The PIL cited the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures released in 2014, which pointed out inordinate delay in investigation and trial, to support its contention.A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath, issued notices to the Delhi government and Police Commissioner earlier this week and asked them to file a status report with regard to the matters raised in the writ petition.The BBA said in its petition that despite the introduction of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in 2012, there had been an incessant delay in the investigation, trial and adjudication of cases in the courts in Delhi.The petition referred to the Supreme Court’s directions for swift investigation by the police and time-bound trial by courts in the cases involving sexual offences.The BBA said the NCRB’s report for 2014 had shown that trial in only 409 of a total of 8,379 cases had been completed.It said the right of speedy trial applied not only to the accused, but to the victim too, as swift trial resulted in a faster adjudication and lesser psychological suffering.Delhi Commission for Women counsel Prabhsahay Kaur, appearing in the court, said a record of pending cases should be called from all districts of the Capital.The petitioner group also sought directions to the police to adhere to a time-bound investigation within three months in cases of sexual offences, rape or sexual assault against children.It also sought directions to the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) and the Delhi State Legal Services Authority to monitor rehabilitation and counselling of all rape and sexual abuse victims for as long as possible.The court has posted the matter for further hearing on March 9.The PIL by Bachpan Bachao Andolan pointedto delay inprobe and trial
