A writ petition was on Monday filed in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court questioning the appointment of Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) Javeed Ahmad.Petitioner Nutan Thakur, a social activist, alleged that Mr Ahmad was appointed as DGP superseding 13 IPS officers from the U.P. cadre, of whom eight are working in the State while four are on central deputation, petitioner’s counsel Ashok Pandey said.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing on January 6, claimed that Mr Ahmad was given priority over the eight IPS officers as against the Supreme Court ruling in ‘Prakash Singh vs Union of India’ case.Whenever there is any alleged deviation from the law of the land, it sends a bad signal and sets a bad precedence, indicating “quid pro quo”, the petition alleged.The petitioner sought a direction for the removal of Mr Ahmad from the post of DGP, claiming he was not being legally empowered to hold this position.Ms Thakur’s husband is Amitabh Thakur, a suspended IPS officer of U.P., who had accused Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh of threatening him on phone with dire consequences, a charge denied by Mr Singh. -- PTI
