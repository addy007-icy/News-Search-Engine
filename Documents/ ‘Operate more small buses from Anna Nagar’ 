Residents and commuters in the western parts of the city want the Metropolitan Transport Corporation to introduce more small bus services connecting various neighbourhoods in Anna Nagar with adjoining areas such as Mogappair, Nolambur, Ambattur, Padi, Villivakkam, Koyambedu, Kilpauk and Ayanavaram.“Among buses, small buses alone are capable of negotiating narrow stretches. More small buses in Anna Nagar should be introduced and we will continue making representations,” said V. Rajagopal, president of Anna Nagar West Extension Phase – II Residents’ Welfare Association.Residents of Anna Nagar West have been demanding small bus services between School Road and Nolambur, a distance of around 4 km. Residents of Banu Nagar in Pudhur near Ambattur want small bus service (Route no: S43: Pudhur – Villivakkam) extended to cover areas such as Meenamedu, Ambattur railway station and Ambattur market.“We find it convenient to travel by a small bus after work rather than take a share auto,” said S. Kamala, a commuter from Nolambur.Similarly, train commuters in Korattur, Villivakkam and other areas find it difficult to travel to CMBT to board long-distance buses as they have to travel far to reach Koyambedu. At present, a small bus is being operated between Villivakkam and Perambur connecting the bus terminus at these places.However, residents in Villivakkam and neighbouring areas such as ICF, Ayanavaram, Padi, Anna Nagar, Tirumangalam, Korattur and Kolathur have to travel by regular buses to reach CMBT in Koyambedu. Further, the existing regular buses connecting these areas with CMBT do only a few number of trips or are damaged or overcrowded.“As we have a limited number of small buses, we can only increase the number of services of these existing small buses covering adjoining areas. We will take a decision soon,” said an MTC official.
