Countdown has begun for widening a narrow road stretch at Mallikatta between St. Agnes Circle and Mallikatta Circle in the city.The council of Mangalore City Corporation (MCC) in its meeting on Monday resolved to widen the stretch either by acquiring the land or getting the land from the owner under the provision of transferable development rights (TDR).Traffic affectedTDR means making available a certain amount of additional built-up area in lieu of the area relinquished or surrendered by the owner of the land.The owner could use extra built-up area either himself or transfer it to another in need of the extra built-up area for an agreed sum of money.A note tabled in the meeting of the council said owner of a clinic has not spared the land required for widening the road at a particular stretch though the same road has been upgraded as concrete road leaving that part.It required 0.027 acres of land.As the road is narrow in that stretch, there was possibilities of accidents.The narrow stretch came in the way of smooth flow of traffic.The council agreed to name the Padil Junction after late Ullal Srinivas Mallya, one of the architects of Mangaluru, by installing his statue.
