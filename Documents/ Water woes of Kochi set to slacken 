he city’s shortage of drinking water will be addressed to some extent when the 100-million-litre a day Maradu Treatment Plant becomes operational. Right now, Kochi receives a supply of 275-280 million litre water a day (mld) from the Aluva plant against a demand of about 410-420 mld.The biggest beneficiary when the plant becomes fully operational in February would be West Kochi as it remains a major problem area as far as water availability is concerned. However, even as water would be made available, old pipelines taking water to Mattancherry and Fort Kochi areas are yet to be replaced despite getting administrative sanction.The Rs. 250-crore Jawaharlal Nehru National Renewal Urban Mission project at Maradu was conceived to augment the water supply in Kochi Corporation and adjacent panchayats. Even though delayed by about seven years, the full commissioning would help people get more water this summer. The plant had a soft launch in December 2014 when it started supplying to Maradu Municipality, Kumbalanghi and Chellanam areas.The plant would be supplying around 24-26 mld to Port area that would leave more water from the Perumanur sump for West Kochi, which gets a total of 33-35 mld, against the demand of about 60 mld.As far as the city’s demand and supply are concerned, the new plant, if operated to full capacity, will bring down the demand-supply gap considerably where KWA would be able to satisfy requirements of new connections too.As Kochi’s water demand had been going up tremendously due to city’s growth, the Maradu plant that had a long term target of meeting the water demands for the next 30 years could be exhausted earlier.Pipeline replacementWork on replacing the pipeline from Perumanur to Thevara and through the Mattancherry bridge to Thoppumpady and Karuvelipady is yet to begin as the Public Works Department and the Corporation are yet to permit the work.The delay is making the KWA have a rethink on supply to West Kochi area from the Maradu plant. Since water is being brought up to the Port, the connectivity would be easier. However, these issues are yet to be formalised.Some of the other ongoing replacement pipeline works include that of about 2 kilometres of Kaloor-Kathrikadavu road and another 900 metres at Pulleppady..
