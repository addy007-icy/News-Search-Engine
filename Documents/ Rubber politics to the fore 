While the direct fallout of his indefinite fast, which completed five days on Friday, for the rubber grower is still to enter the realm of the tangible, the agitation by Kerala Congress (M) leader Jose K. Mani has put his foes, both within the coalition and in Opposition, on the back foot, and has projected him as a rallying point for his party workers. In the process, he has once again proved rubber politics is still a potent electoral mobilisation tool.The decision of the Centre to restrict natural rubber import to just two ports and to bring limited ban on its import may or may not be the fallout of the fast. While the KC(M) would like to attribute the developments to its agitation, those in the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Left Democratic Front would like to believe otherwise. But credit goes to Mr. Mani for identifying the right cause to champion on the eve of an election: the Congress leaders who tried to scorn the agitation as an organised drama had to express solidarity; the BJP Central leaders had to talk to him; and a confused LDF had to call for a hartal on February 3. Just like Mr. Chandy became the rallying point for all anti-Hindutva forces after he was left out of the R. Sanker statue unveiling ceremony, Mr. Maniâ€™s cause suddenly brought together all pro-farmer forces in Central Travancore.An interesting component of the agitation is the expression of solidarity by bishops of most Christian denominations. Personally, Jose K. Mani has experienced a sudden upscale of his stock within the party which still remain divided for all practical purpose.
