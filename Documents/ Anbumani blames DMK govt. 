The political battle over the deaths of three students at SVS Yoga and Naturopathy College intensified on Wednesday with former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss charging the DMK with providing the “essentiality certificate” to the institution without proper inspection during its 2006-2011 regime.Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Anbumani, the chief ministerial candidate of the PMK, said essentiality certificates were provided by the respective State governments for medical institutions after ascertaining whether they have the necessary infrastructure to run a college.“It is only after the State issues an essentiality certificate, the Central department processes it. As per information, this college started functioning in 2008. Who issued the essentiality certificate without the college having the required infrastructure and faculty strength,” he asked.On Monday, DMDK president Vijayakant had trained his guns on Dr. Anbumani stating that it was during the tenure “of a Minister from Tamil Nadu” at the Centre that the college received its clearance.Dr. Anbumani said Mr. Vijayakant had comfortably avoided mentioning the DMK for inexplicable reasons. “Instead he has taken my name when everyone knows I never handled Indian System of Medicines and the AYUSH department,” he claimed.The PMK leader said the only way the truth could be established was through a CBI inquiry. “I hope the DMK would be ready. I have no problems with such an inquiry as my side is absolutely clear,” he said.‘Never violated law’Reacting, former State Health Minister and DMK leader M.R.K. Panneerselvam said there was no way an essentiality certificate could be issued without inspection.“It is not possible to recollect the exact details of this file. But there is no way a college could get the certificate without proper inspections. The DMK regime always followed the law. You could be rest assured that every procedure was properly followed,” he said.
