In a bid to placate the Patidar community who have revived their agitation against the Gujarat government, Chief Minister Anandiben Patel has asked the State Home Department to withdraw the 74 police cases, involving 380 Patels who were booked for rioting.However, the Government's decision does not include serious cases of sedition in which the agitation leader Hardik Patel and his top aides are involved.According to the State Government spokesman and Health Minister Nitin Patel, the Chief Minister held several meetings with the Patel community leaders and decided to withdraw the "lighter cases.""No relief to Hardik Patel and 13 others who are in jail facing serious charges and their bail pleas have also been repeatedly rejected by various courts," Mr Patel said.However, he indicated that in the second round, other cases may also be reviewed and withdrawn."The Opposition party is politicising the issue by spreading misinformation that 1000s Patidars are in jails," Mr. Patel said, adding "as per the police records, 1750 people were arrested after the agitation in August September and only 14 in jail while others have been released in bails."However, the State administration's decision has apparently not cut much ice with the agitating Patidars."We will not withdraw our agitation till Hardik Patel and his aides are released," Varun Patel, member of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) said reacting to the government's conciliatory offer.
