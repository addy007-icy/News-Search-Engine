: Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) will soon do away with the word “blind” for referring to an accident-prone spot inside its campus.In order to not hurt the sensibilities of visually-challenged students, outgoing V-C S.K. Sopory is working on renaming all boards inside the university that say “blind spot” to “accident-prone” instead. “I was talking to students from the Equal Opportunity Cell and they pointed it out to me. They said the word “blind spot” is very demeaning. We are now going to get all the boards changed to “accident-prone”,” said Mr. Sopory.“It is only when you talk to people with disabilities that you understand the hardships they face,” he added.JNU, a barrier-free university that caters to the needs of people with disabilities, has been taking initiatives for the students through its equal opportunities cell.A disabled-friendly bus for physically-challenged students has also been started. The bus, which has a ramp to assist wheel-chair bound students, was donated by BHEL as a CSR initiative.“One bus is insufficient for the large number of students. We demand at least one more bus be brought in to facilitate the travelling needs of differently-abled students,” Saurabh Sharma, Joint Secretary of the JNU Students’ Union said.
