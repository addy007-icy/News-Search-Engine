“To readers away from the happenings, The Hindu ’s coverage of the State School Arts Festival brings its verve and vibrancy through selective nuggets interspersed with cogent comments.”– Ayyasseri Raveendranath, Aranmula“It was disappointing that all those who participated in the Oppana competition got ‘A’ grades, despite many of the performances being below par”– Jayakumar Gopinath, Kollam“If there was something that could be improved at the arts festival, it would be the interval between performances. Setting a time limit for installing instruments or props would considerably bring down the duration consumed by competitions.”E.K. George, businessman, Kozhikode“The competition was tough in folk song, as there were 30 teams in the fray. We did well.”- A.V.Gouri, Plus Two student“It’s a great thing to see so many talented instrumentalists playing a variety of instruments. Our music industry can tap into the wide pool of talent available here.”– G.Merin, Student, Alappuzha
