Plugging the time lags in clearing garbage so as to lift it as early as possible, the GVMC will shift to picking up bulk garbage from commercial and business establishments and apartments from next month.The process has already begun in December with the GVMC deploying 35 vehicles to pick up garbage from hotels, tiffin centres, malls, hospitals, shopping complexes and hospitals. About 300 tonnes is being directly lifted from such premises, it was learnt.The steps are expected to save money for the GVMC and equally important, to prevent the impression of heaps of garbage lying on the road-side for long.As many as 6,000 business and commercial establishments and apartment complexes have been identified for the purpose in zones II, III, IV and V. The city generates about 1,000 tonnes of garbage. The plan is being implemented to lift 30 to 40 per cent at the doorstep so that roads will be clean. The dumper bins that will be available once the plan is implemented will be shifted to areas where garbage is being heaped on the roads now.Notices to be servedThe identified establishments and apartments will be served individual notices before fixing a fee for collecting the garbage at their doorstep, sources said.The draft Solid Waste Management rules 2015 that are awaiting the approval of Parliament under “Duties and responsibilities of Urban Local Bodies” say that they should “prescribe from time to time user fee as deemed appropriate and collect the fee from waste generators for the sustainability of collection, transportation, processing disposal of solid waste.”The waste generators will be divided into five categories and user fee ranging from Rs.100 to Rs.500 is proposed to be collected from them, according to sources.Compacting machinesThe new plan also awaits the arrival of five compacting machines ordered by the GVMC. In four trips, they carry 40 tonnes of garbage and the five will be able to transport 200 tonnes- roughly half the new scheme intends to clear early. The 35 vehicles are now paid fee for each trip to the transfer station on One Town from where the garbage is transported to Kapuluppda dump yard. Their number is expected to decrease once the compactors are pressed into service.
