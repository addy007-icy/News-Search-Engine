Silk Thread(By Zoukak Theatre Company and Cultural Association, Lebanon) at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m.)Silk Thread investigates inherited social structures that define and shape gender stereotypes as identified through local mythologies, fairytales, modern legends, contemporary stories and actual events.At a time when the issue of the disappeared is still not tackled by the Lebanese government, unwilling to uncover the ruins of the past and the mass graves fearing the consequences, and when the law against domestic violence is being deformed and still not officially applied, the performance questions social amnesia towards these issues by digging into the Lebanese cultural heritage. Born in Lebanon, Maya Zbib, the director of the play, is a theatre performer and director and a founding member of Zoukak.Addehavum Mruthadehavam (By Floating Island Actors Group, Kerala) 4 p.m.As a police constable it was Satheeshan’s duty to watch and guard. But on this day, it is for a dead body; the body of one who has hung himself inside a forest. Satheesan waits for his superior to come and make the inquest. However, since the superior officer is busy with a Minister’s visit, Satheeshan has to wait alone in that forest with the dead body for a long time. He spends his time by trying to find out the reason of death. And when he concludes, his attitude towards the dead body changes.
