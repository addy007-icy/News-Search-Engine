The Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA), mandated to oversee the integrated development of the group of islands on the northern side of Kochi city, is running out of funds and the fate of new projects hangs in the balance.The 30th general council of the GIDA chaired by the Chief Minister here on Monday was told that the funds available with the authority, at present, stood at Rs.293 crore. The financial commitments on account of the projects approved by the general council or on orders from the State government exceeded the funds in hand.The GIDA will also have to take up the liability of around Rs.116 crore in the form of capital gains tax, bringing up the total liability of the authority to more than Rs.130 crore.Though the general council had approved projects involving an expenditure of more than Rs.480 crore, the GIDA had taken up only projects worth more than Rs.360 crore. Taking into consideration the financial commitments on ongoing projects of over Rs. 200 crore and the capital gains tax dues, the GIDA’s fund shortage totals up to Rs.31 crore.Sub-committee formedMeanwhile, the general council has constituted a sub-committee headed by the District Collector to work out the details of the alignment of a portion of the Kochi-Paravoor coastal road. Members of the sub-committee include MLAs V. D. Satheesan and S. Sarma.The sub-committee will look into acquisition of land for the project. Work on two major bridges — Chathanad-Kadamakkudy and Moolampally-Pizhala — has made good progress so far. There are two smaller bridges to be built. The project is expected to be completed in a year.
