Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham on Tuesday made it clear that no VIP tickets would be issued for darshan at Arasavilli temple during the Ratha Sapthami celebrations, scheduled to be organised on February 14. However, he said that protocol arrangements would be in place for people’s representatives and senior officials.Reviewing the arrangements for the festival with Police, Revenue, Endowments and other departments at the Collectorate here, he said that as many as 2.5 lakh devotees were expected to throng Arasavilli on the eve of Ratha Sapthami day.Unprecedented rush was expected as the Ratha Sapthami is falling on the day of star ‘Ashwini’ and Sunday, which is considered very auspicious, he said.Citing the past instances of devotees being put into troubles owing to the lack of coordination between the government departments, the Collector instructed the officials to come out with fool-proof arrangements this time. Additional counters for the distribution of prasadam, annadanam will be set up at places such as Indira Vignan Bhavan, Tourism Budget hotel and DCMS office on the Arasavilli road.“Andhra Pradesh Gramin Vikas Bank is expected to sell tickets for Ksheerabhisekham and devotees with the tickets will be allowed on the Brahmana Veedhi route to reach the temple from midnight of February 13,” the officials said, adding that wheel-chairs would be in place for the convenience of senior citizens and differently abled persons.
