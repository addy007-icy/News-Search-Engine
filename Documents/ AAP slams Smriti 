Aam Aadmi Party staged a country-wide protest against the Centre and accused HRD Minister Smriti Irani of misleading the nation over the alleged suicide of a Dalit research scholar. “Smriti Irani has made a mockery of the deceased student’s pain by putting forth false arguments,” party leader Sanjay Singh said and added that “she displayed typical RSS mentality.”Contradicting the Union Minister’s claims, AAP leader said that no Dalit professor headed the committee, formed by the Executive Council of Hyderabad Central University, that had upheld the decision to expel the five students, including Rohith Vemula, the student who committed suicide.The AAP leader also said that Bandaru Dattatreya’s intervention had more to do with his “anti-Dalit sentiment”.
