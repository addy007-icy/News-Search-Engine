Nearly 40 works, including sculptures, are on display at the exhibition.Prof. Sahana’s glass sculptures are one of a kind, thanks to the technique and the process involved in making them. “Glass is used as a medium abroad for ages, and I wanted to use this medium and worked on it for long,” Prof. Sahana says.He works in glass slumping, casting, fusing and stained glass technique for fusion of colours with glass.Challenging task“I pick up different glass pieces strewn across and try to fit them into my work.
