On January 8, the Delhi Home Department issued a circular to other departments to look for a file on constitution of an SIT to probe the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.“It is to bring to the notice of all the concerned that file no…. regarding constitution of Special Investigation Team (1984 Riots) ….. is not traceable. It is, therefore, requested to all concerned to kindly look into their respective departments and if the file is found it may kindly be returned to the Home Department,” read the circular.Now the sudden reappearance of the “missing” file has left the Aam Aadmi Party government embarrassed, especially when Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is aggressively campaigning in Punjab for the Assembly elections slated in early 2017. Mr. Kejriwal has, time and again, raised the issue of justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims.However, the AAP termed the missing file story as “rumour mongering”.“The Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP government at the Centre are trying to create an atmosphere of confusion by resorting to rumour mongering. The attempt to scandalise the false news about a file going missing at the Delhi Secretariat was aimed at creating such confusion,” read the AAP’s official statement.When asked why Mr. Kumar issued the circular, a senior government official said “there was some confusion”. He further clarified that Home Minister Satyendar Jain had asked for the file “only because it was reportedly missing”.In February 2014, the Delhi Cabinet had set up an SIT to probe the 1984 Sikh-riots, but it could not be notified as the government resigned. In February 2015, before the AAP was elected to power, the Centre constituted a three-member SIT, leaving the file of the proposed SIT “inconsequential”.
