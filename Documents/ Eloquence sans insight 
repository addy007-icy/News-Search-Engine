The English elocution competition for higher secondary school (HSS) students at the Public Library auditorium on Thursday failed to live up to expectations.The topic ‘Challenges before the country’ provided ample scope for the participants to speak at length on contemporary issues plaguing India, but few of them had anything insightful to say. Grammatical errors and stylised delivery didn’t help either.Intolerance seemed to be a topic touched upon by most speakers. The death of rationalists M.M. Kalburgi and Narendra Dabholkar, the Dadri lynching, the beef ban, and the suicide of Rohith Vemula were mentioned.One only wished that the participants’ views on at least a couple of issues could be heard in depth rather than what often seemed a list of the various challenges. Of the 17 contestants, 14 secured A grade and the rest B.Arya Rajendran of GHSS, Balla East, Kasaragod, bagged the first place. Karthika K. of VB HSS, Thrissur, was second, and Kavya Madhavan of Shenoy Smaraka GHSS, Payyannur, Kannur, was third.
