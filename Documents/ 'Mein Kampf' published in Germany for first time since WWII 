A German historical institute is launching an annotated edition of “Mein Kampf,” the first version of Adolf Hitler’s notorious manifesto to be published in Germany since the end of World War II.Bavaria’s state Finance Ministry had previously prevented the book’s publication, but its copyright expired 70 years after the Nazi leader’s death.Germany’s Education Minister said Friday that the new version being launched in Munich would help debunk myths surrounding the work.Johanna Wanka told German channel n-tv that the book, which was never formally banned, was already widely available online and that the annotations would “show pupils what criminal views could be found in Hitler’s book right from the start.”
