Vannamei shrimp farming in the State has received a big boost with the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) issuing licence to the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) to set up the first hatchery for producing seeds of the exotic shrimp at the university’s Fisheries Research Station on Puthuvypeen island.In the initial stage, the hatchery would start functioning as the nauplius rearing centre that has the capacity to produce two million seeds a year. In the first phase, the hatchery would be used for the university’s own purposes and that of farmers associated with the varsity, said a communication here on Sunday.The licence to set up the vannamei hatchery was a “milestone for shrimp farming in the State”, said KUFOS Vice-Chancellor B. Madhusoodana Kurup.
