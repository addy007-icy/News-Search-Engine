YSR Congress took objection to the proposal of Andhra Pradesh government to regularise assigned lands saying it would benefit TDP leaders.Alleging that the assigned lands fell into the hands of TDP leaders while Dalits and other weaker sections were alienated from those lands, YSR Congress spokesperson Vasireddy Padma said the government was planning to amend the Act to allow the sale of assigned lands.She said TDP leaders would be the actual beneficiaries when the lands get sold. The fertile assigned lands in the capital region were in great demand and the TDP leaders have managed to take advantage.
