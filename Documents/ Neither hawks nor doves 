Nirupama Rao deserves appreciation for her insightful observation that “the emphasis in our relations with Pakistan must be on keeping the channels of dialogue open together with vigilant intelligence and an astute assessment of Pakistan’s moves” (“Driven by neither hawks nor doves”, Jan. 6). By his spontaneous engagements with Nawaz Sharif, Mr. Modi has laid the groundwork for taking forward Indo-Pak relations despite terror being unleashed by non-state actors. Also, Mr. Sharif might need more time to convince his army colleagues that geopolitical and economic compulsions demand that the two countries come closer.However, the issue of terror will gain priority at the coming secretary-level talks in Islamabad. Pakistan must be told fair and square that there will be no uninterruptible dialogue if it does not permanently stop terror against India. The U.S., which urges the two countries to stay the course on bilateral relations, must also urge Pakistan to not use terror as an instrument of state policy.Kangayam R. Narasimhan,ChennaiThe writer rightly asks why the Pakistani intelligence and security forces do not silence the terror groups that operate and plan attacks against India on Pakistani soil. Either Mr. Sharif is helpless or he is looking the other way, which obviously means that such terrorist attacks are being carried out with his knowledge.Sincerity of purpose must be a two-way path. It is time for India to call a spade a spade.Seshagiri Row Karry,Hyderabad
