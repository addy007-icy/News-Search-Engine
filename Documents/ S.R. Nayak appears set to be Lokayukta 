With Vikramjit Sen, former Supreme Court judge, withdrawing his consent to be the Karnataka Lokayukta, chairman of the Karnataka Law Commission, S.R. Nayak, appears set to head the anti-graft body.With Chief Minister Siddaramaiah having the “last word”, the appointment of Mr. Nayak is a “foregone conclusion”, said sources in the government. It is said that Mr. Sen withdrew his consent following the government’s inclination to send the name of Mr. Nayak, to the Governor.The post of Lokayukta remained vacant following the resignation of Y. Bhaskar Rao.Noting that “insiders” who headed the institution (N. Venkatachala and Santosh Hegde) had made their mark while in office, a senior Congress defended the Chief Minister’s choice of an “insider” (Mr. Nayak) as against an “outsider”. A few lawyers also opposed Mr. Sen’s name.Leader of the Opposition Jagadish Shettar, however, said the government had “insulted” Mr. Sen. “The Chief Minister is responsible for the whole controversy,” he alleged. The Opposition, meanwhile, has made it clear that it was against Mr. Nayak, citing the controversies surrounding his properties. Speaking to media persons in Hubballi, Mr. Shettar on Saturday demanded the necessity of amending the Karnataka Lokayukta Act to ensure a unanimous choice for the post of Lokayukta.While N. Ananda’s as Upalokayukta was a unanimous choice by the committee, differences surfaced between the Congress and BJP members with regard to selection of the Lokayukta.
