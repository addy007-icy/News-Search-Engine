The Forest Department in the district has announced that it would introduce ‘Smrithi Vanam’ concept in the Nature Park that is set to open for public shortly.Divisional Forest Officer S. Satyanarayana informed the same to District Collector P. Satyanarayaan Reddy and Joint Collector N. Satyanarayana, who visited the park on Thursday.Under the concept, Mr. Satyanarayana said any person or organisation can plant a sapling in the Nature Park in memory of any person or special occasion in their life for which they would have to donate Rs. 5,000 to the park management. The management would erect a permanent name board of the donor with the date of plantation. All the family members will be allowed in to the park twice in a year without any entry fee.Mr. Satyanarayana said they would deposit the amount collected through Smrithi Vanam in a bank and the interest amount will be spent on managing the park.The Collector and Joint Collector opined that the concept would certainly get good response from the citizens of Nalgonda since there was no such concept at any place in the district. Meanwhile, the Collector said that they would invite the Forest Minister, Jogu Ramanna, and Energy Minister G. Jagadishwar Reddy to inaugurate the park soon.
