The case of the abrupt transfer of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) of Kudligi sub-division in Ballari district has taken a new turn with Labour Minister P.T. Parameshwar Naik, who is also the district in-charge Minister, saying in a television footage that it was done at his behest.Mr. Naik, till Tuesday afternoon, maintained that the transfer of Anupama Shenai was an “administrative matter” and he had no role to play. Now, Mr. Naik has been caught making the claim in a video footage, said to be taken at a party workers’ meeting in Hampasagar village of Hadagali Assembly constituency on Tuesday. He says that he got the official transferred because she was not responding to his calls. The video has gone viral on social media and is being aired on regional channels.“For me, the party workers are important and not officials. I spoke to her over phone for 42 seconds and when I tried again, she did not respond. This was the reason why I got her transferred. Why do we need officials, who do not listen to the district Minister,” he is heard saying.It may be mentioned here that Ms. Shenai, a week ago, got a call from an ‘unknown’ number with the caller stating that the district Minister wanted to speak. While she was waiting for the Minister to speak, she got another call from the Superintendent of Police, because of which she cut the earlier call. This had allegedly angered the Minister. In less than 48 hours, Ms. Shenai was transferred.
