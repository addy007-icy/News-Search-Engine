Knight Frank India has just launched the fourth edition of its flagship half-yearly report ‘India Real Estate’, containing an analysis of the residential and office market performance of Bengaluru from July to December 2015 (H2 2015).Speaking about the findings, Satish B.N. Executive Director- South, says, “The Bengaluru residential market remains one of the best performing markets in India. Although it did witness some lows with 13% drop in launches year on year, this has in turn helped in bringing down the stress by cutting down the inventory. We presume an upward pressure on prices with an expected 7% weighted average price hike in the next six months.”The Bengaluru office market, on the other hand, continues to be bullish in its demand with record high figures since 2011. However, dearth of ready-to-occupy office space is a concern as it is unable to catch up with the quantum of demand, leading to emergence of peripheral locations in South Bengaluru witnessing occupier interest, says the report.Residential takeaways* Bengaluru remains one of the best performing markets with steady sales; restricted launches have cut down the stress* The city recorded a decline of 27% Y-O-Y in new launches in 2015, the lowest number of launches in five years* South Bengaluru witnesses increase in new launches in H2 2015; peripheral locations such as Chandapura, Anekal emerge as upcoming budget destinations* West Bengaluru emerges as the best performing market with the least number of quarters to sell; Metro connectivity and lifestyle projects adding to its attractivenessOffice takeaways* Bengaluru office market continues to be bullish in its demand with 11.1 mn sq. ft absorption in 2015, the highest since 2011* Absorption in H2-2015 increased by 14% Year-on-Year; new completions remain steady* While e-commerce is on the horizon, IT/ITeS continued to dominate in H2-2015 with 70% absorption* Peripheral office markets in the South and North witnessed increased occupier interest in H2 2015 owing to dearth of large ready spaces in other prime office markets of the city.
