The State government’s decision to extend the eighth edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) to Mysuru has cheered film enthusiasts and the tourism industry.The festival will be held simultaneously in Bengaluru and Mysuru from January 28.The decision has led to a debate whether Mysuru can be developed into a permanent hub for an international film festival considering its cultural profile.In fact, Mysuru, once, was a popular location for film shoots. Even today, Mysuru enjoys the status though the number of shoots has dropped.Manu, secretary, Mysore Film Society, said that film enthusiasts were eagerly looking forward to the festival.“Mysuru has the audience and it is time we develop the city as a new hub and cultivate a good cinema culture among the youth. The key factor is people will have no worries of traffic or pollution here and can happily watch films besides sight-seeing,” he felt.Rangayana theatre artiste Prashanth Hiremath said that the crowd for the film festival, conducted as part of Bahuroopi National Theatre Festival recently, showed the promise if Mysuru became a permanent venue for an international film fest.Mysuru is already a hub of film-based activities with films, documentaries and short films being produced here by young filmmakers.B.S. Prashanth, former president, Mysore Travel Agents’ Association, said that Mysuru should attract mega events as it has a wide canvas. “The benefits are aplenty if Mysuru made a permanent venue for film festival. It can also bring revenue to the tourism industry as well. I feel film festivals should happen ideally in places like Mysuru that can draw people,” he said.A senior official said that film festivals bring delegates and international filmmakers of repute. “This help to project the city and its character at the global level. The habit of watching can be cultivated here besides spreading the film culture by holding such events happening in cities like Mysuru which is the State’s cultural capital,” he added.Mysuru has a character of its own. I foresee a promising future for the city as a new destination for international film festival.Prashanth HiremathRangayana theatre artiste
