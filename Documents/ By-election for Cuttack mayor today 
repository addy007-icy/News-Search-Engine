The by-election to fill up the vacant post of Cuttack mayor will be held on Friday as per the schedule fixed by the State Election Commission. The confusion over Friday’s by-poll was removed on Thursday when the Orissa High Court dismissed a writ petition that had challenged the January 8 SEC notification.The post of mayor of Cuttack had fallen vacant on December 29 last when the then mayor Anita Behera of BJD resigned over ration card row. Ms Behera too resigned from the post of corporator , causing a vacancy in ward No. 21 of the city.Challenging the SEC notification for holding the mayor by-election ahead of corporation by-election, one Kanaklata Naik, an SC woman from Ward No 21 had moved the High CourtBench of Justice B K Nayak of the High Court however, did not find any infraction of law in SEC notification saying: “There is no mandate of law that such by-election to fill up the vacancy in the office of corporator must be filled up before election to the office of the mayor is held.”
