Vakalapudi beach on the city outskirts is gearing up for the three-day NTR Beach Festival-2016 scheduled to begin on January 8. Works are under way for the construction of welcome arch, main dais and two small stages for the performances by the film and television artistes and technicians, besides the song and dance performances by the enthusiastic artistes from the district. Unlike the past three years, the main dais would be constructed near Haritha Beach Resorts of the AP Tourism Development Corporation, reducing a few metres of walk to the public from the parking area to enter the festival.Similarly, parking would be arranged in different places to make it convenient to the public, who lodged complaints about the forcible long walks to enter the beach. In a bid to address the problem of traffic snarls, a couple of bridges were under construction on the salt creek. It may be recalled that both the pedestrians and vehicle drivers experienced problems due to the narrow bridge across the salt creek and the traffic snarls took place due to the slow movement of pedestrians and vehicles on the bridge. The new bridges, however, could address the traffic problem in a better way.Replicas of templesReplicas of famous temples in the district were under construction in the beach, as the make shift abode of the Annavaram shrine drew huge crowds in the last three years.The number of miniature temples will be increased this year and same is the case with the stalls and food courts.Works are under way for the construction of welcome arch, main dais and two small stages
