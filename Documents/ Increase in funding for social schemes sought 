The People’s Budget Initiative (PBI) and the People’s Monitoring Committee (PMC), a network of civil society budget groups, want the Centre to step up funding for social sector schemes in the Union Budget 2016-17 with focus on generating higher resources.Ahead of the civil society organisations’ date with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for a pre-budget consultation at Delhi on January 12, representatives of PBI, PMC and Centre for Rural Studies and Development (CRSD) told newspersons here on Monday that there was no rationale in the Centre’s act of pruning the budgetary allocation to several social sector schemes in 2015-16.A staggering amount of about Rs.1.75 lakh crore was reduced in the allocation to social sector schemes in 2015-16 budget compared to the previous year.As a result, the implementation of several critical schemes from the perspective of the poor was adversely impacted.Schemes such Scheduled Castes Sub Plan, Integrated Child Development Scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Tribal Sub Plan, Health and Family Welfare, Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mid Day Meal and National Rural Health Mission were among the schemes which suffered huge funding cuts, B.D.A. Bose, S. Shivalingam, S. Srisailam, K. Rajalingam, K. Subhash and others explained.Funding to even the government pet schemes such as Swachh Bharat was reduced by half in the 2015-16 budget to Rs.6,000 crore from Rs.12,000 crore in the previous year, they pointed out.What was the fun in imposing Swachh cess on people to bear the travelling (flight) charges of about 200 brand ambassadors of the programme, they sought to know.Reduction in allocationsThey alleged that the Centre had either scrapped (discontinued), pruned its share of funding by increasing States’ funding or drastically cut allocation to some schemes still implemented only by it for 66 schemes in the 2015-16 budget.They termed the Centre’s claim of devolving more funds 42 per cent from the taxes collected by it from 32 per cent earlier as a myth in the backdrop of cut in its funds to many schemes implemented by States.
