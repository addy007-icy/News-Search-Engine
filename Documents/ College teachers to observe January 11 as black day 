College teachers across the State will observe black day on January 11 to reiterate their long-pending demands.The Joint Action Committee representing three major teachers’ associations – the Association of University Teachers (AUT), Tamil Nadu Government Teachers Association and Manomaniam Sundaranar Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers’ Association (MUTA) – will wear black badges on that day and will picket in Chennai, Tiruchi, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tirunelveli on January 20 and 21.The associations had planned a similar picketing in November last.“We postponed our picketing from November 16 based on the DCE’s assurance that the file for Career Advancement Scheme had been sent to the finance committee for approval. There has been no response from him yet. We have no option but protest,” said N. Pasupathi, AUT general secretary.
