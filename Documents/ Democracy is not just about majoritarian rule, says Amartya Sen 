Nobel laureate Amartya Sen said in Kolkata on Wednesday that Democracy is not just about majoritarian rule.“Now if you think about India, when we say that democracy may be under some threat... what are the issues? Well first of all, one of the issue democracy is not just a majoritarian rule, it also involves minority rights, it involves liberty and liberty of expressions and so on,” Prof. Sen said.Addressing a gathering at Presidency University after being conferred D. Litt by his alma mater, Prof. Sen said that what is “now called majority is in fact not majority it is mostly plurality, where you might get 30 per cent or 39 per cent (votes) and you might sweep the Parliament”.Pointing out that the members of the Constituent Assembly were aware that such a situation will arise, Prof. Sen said that proceedings of the Constituent Assembly also tells that those who drafted the Constitution were conscious of the Upper House having a status of its own.“They discussed Upper House having a status of its own , and if a party is in a position to flourish nor for one year, not for two years, but three, four five years,” Prof. Sen said, adding that in such a situation the party will have a sway in the Upper House.The economist recalled his days at the Presidency College when he was an undergraduate student. He spoke about how the college attracted the best talent along with values of cultivation of excellence and “real commitment to reasoning and argument”.“Tolerance is a very great virtue and right now in India, we need it very badly,” Prof. Sen, said referring to how poet Henry Louis Vivian Derozio associated with the institute who didn’t have enmity with any group, but questioned every group.
