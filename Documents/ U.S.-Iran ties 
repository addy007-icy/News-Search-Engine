The lifting of U.S. sanctions on Iran marks a major thaw in their bilateral relations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, further solidified by the prisoner-swap arrangement (“A new beginning with Iran,” editorial, Jan.19). Iran’s reintegration into the world economy is a positive development. Pressing problems such as the Syrian conflict, the refugee problem in Europe and the Yemeni conflict can now be better addressed as there will be a wider representation. However, Iran’s rivalry with Saudi Arabia is a matter of concern. For India, a successful completion of the Chabahar port project should give it better access to the region and help it gain more port projects. However, all the positive outcomes of the Iran deal are in danger of being undone if a Republican candidate becomes the next U.S. President.Akshay Viswanathan,Thiruvananthapuram
