An expert has concluded that the water leak occurring at Gopalapatnam is not from the water supply pipelines of the GVMC but owing to the saturation of the aquifer.The investigation covered sub-surface seepage at VUDA Colony, ZP High School Ground and a pond at the Rajaka Colony nearby at Gopalapatnam.The leak occurred in the first week of November and based on initial tests the GVMC officials came to the conclusion that the water did not leak from its Tatipudi or Godavari pipelines.The flow of water had occurred a few months earlier too and trial and error tests were carried out by the GVMC.After the November leak owing to which water flowed continuously through the drains in VUDA Colony and apprehensions by the colony residents about the safety of buildings, GVMC asked for an investigation by a retired Geo Engineering professor of Andhra University the reasons for the leak.The investigation by Prof. V. Venkateswara Rao described the seepage as a regular phenomenon occurring every year. The variation of quantity, base flow or seepage flow is due to the total amount and intensity of rainfall and frequency of the rainy days, he analysed.The high quantity of seepage flow observed in the first week of November is mainly due to high intensity of rainfall- 157 mm- continuously for three days immediately after the end of the Southwest Monsoon in the city, he said in his report to the GVMC.At the end of the Southwest Monsoon itself, total amount of rainfall occurred was equal to the cityâ€™s average annual rainfall of 1,000 mm.The 157 mm rainfall from October 31 to November 2 is over and above the average and it might have saturated the aquifer, Prof. Rao observes.Water from the saturated aquifer oozes from cracks in rock formation or wherever there is clay in the earth, Prof. Venkateswara Rao told The Hindu . Testing the seepage water and GVMC pipeline water for chlorine content, he concluded that the seepage was not caused by any leak from the pipelines, it was learnt.Prof. Rao has recommended that as the groundwater leakage is a regular phenomenon it can be used for domestic needs and development of greenery through open wells at appropriate locations.Water from the saturated aquifer oozes from cracks in rock formation or wherever there is clay in the earthV.
