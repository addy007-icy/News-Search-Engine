Pattali Makkal Katchi founder S. Ramadoss on Sunday said it is wrong to dub the party as a caste outfit as it has been championing for the rights of all sections of people.Speaking at the northern zone conference in Villupuram, Dr. Ramadoss said, “Whenever injustice is sought to be done we have been raising voice of revolt on various issues as has been seen during protests in all districts in Tamil Nadu. We are for the development of all sections of society, Tamils and Tamil Nadu and not for one particular caste as had been projected by various parties.”He said the people have decided to vote for the PMK in the forthcoming assembly elections.According to him Anbumani Ramadoss is the best person to provide good governance and no other leader in any political party can match him.Chief ministerial candidate Anbumani said, “PMK has a blueprint for the development of Tamil Nadu and if elected to power will provide a transparent and corruption free governance.”
