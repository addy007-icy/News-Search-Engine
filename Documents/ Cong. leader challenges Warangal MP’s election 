Former Union Minister and Congress leader Sarvey Sathyanarayana filed an election petition in the Hyderabad High Court challenging the election of Pasunoori Dayakar as Member of Parliament for Warangal (SC) constituency.He contended that Mr. Dayakar was not eligible to contest the election as he was holding a contract of BPCL and suffered disqualification. He further alleged that Mr. Dayakar resorted to corrupt practices to secure more votes in the election.While urging the court to declare the election of Mr. Dayakar as void, Mr. Sarvey Sathyanarayana sought the court to declare him as duly elected to the above constituency.The papers will be scrutinised by the registry and placed before the Acting Chief Justice and then the case will be allotted to a judge who will try the case.
