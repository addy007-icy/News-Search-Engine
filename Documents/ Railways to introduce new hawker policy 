Ahead of the Railway Budget next month, the Union Ministry of Railways has planned to frame a new hawker policy aimed at completely restricting unauthorized hawkers on platforms.The Railways which has mooted the proposals under the “Make Railways Better” has also sought suggestions from rail users. A comprehensive report will be represented to the Union Minister Suresh Prabhu for action, officials said.One of the major plans is ascertain the number of hawkers to allow on a platform and providing hawkers with licences. The hawkers who are already selling at those platforms would be given preference for licensing.Officials said that quality checks would be put in place for licensed hawkers and that only IRCTC authorised hawkers, in proper and recognisable uniform and badge displaying their name and permit number would be allowed on platforms.Railway Protection Force (RPF) will be asked to ensure that prohibited items like tobacco are not sold in the railway premises.If any unauthorized vendor sneaks into the railway premises, they would be arrested and fined. The RPF would keep a vigil that no unauthorised vendor is selling things inside the train. Closed Circuit Television and spots checks and spot checks would be implemented so as to keep a tab on RPF and other officials, they said. The prices of the products that the licensed hawkers sell would be approved by the Railways and the prices displayed on each item.If unlicensed hawkers are found selling their wares freely in coaches or on platforms, then disciplinary action must be taken against him and the Station Superintendent, it has been proposed. All food items sold must be clean and safely packed and no exposed food stuff may be sold by hawkers.All vendors must be given training on hygiene and safety aspects A mechanism to receive complaints against hawkers and its expeditious solution is another proposal, officials said.
