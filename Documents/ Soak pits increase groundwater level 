The construction of soak pits, an initiative taken up by Collector D Ronald Rose, at Ibrahimpur village in Siddipet mandal of Medak district is showing excellent results. The ground water levels have increased in the village and also across the district in comparison with other villages. This was despite lack of rains and all mandals in the district declared drought affected.The groundwater department has conducted an impact study for the months of October, November and December 2015 selecting three locations in the village and seven locations outside the village. During the month of October the ground water availability was at 12.07 metres level followed by 11.30 metres in November and 11 metres in the month of December. It was expected that the water availability levels in the month of January was expected to increase further.Similarly, at seven locations outside the village the ground water levels fell down further. It was 9.12 metres in the month October followed by 10.82 metres in the month of November and 11.35 metres in December. The situation was more or less same across the district where ground water levels were falling drastically due to lack of rains for the past two years. At many places the farmers discontinued farming due to fell down of ground water levels and water yield as well.Impressed with the results of Ibrahimpur, the district administration has decided replicate the experiment across the district. The authorities wrote to the State level officials seeking permission to link this programme to NREGS and sanctioning funds in this regard. The works would commence once the funds were sanctioned.
