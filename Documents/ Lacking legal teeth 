While the existence of the BMTF is always in question, BMTF officials say that more legal teeth is required than a mere extension of its term. “Unlike the Lokayukta or the CBI probing corruption charges, the BMTF has no power to book a suo motu case, thereby restricting its work. There is a January 2015 High Court ruling stating that BMTF can only book cases under the Karnataka Land Revenue Act and not the IPC. The rules of mandate for BMTF need to be amended to give the force these powers,” a BMTF official said.
