The eight edition of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) organised by the Kerala Sangeeta Nataka Akademi will begin here on Sunday. Minister for Culture K.C. Joseph will inaugurate the festival.In all, 33 performances of 20 plays from 10 countries will be staged during the seven-day festival, which will conclude on January 16. Theatre groups from Japan, Turkey, Algeria, Lebenon, Singapore, Iran, Malaysia and Germany will perform.‘Sharira’, a performance by the Chennai-based Chandralekha Group, will kick-start the festival on Sunday after the inaugural ceremony. ‘Body Political’ is the theme of the edition.Explaining the theme, Sankar Venkiteswaran, the artistic director of the festival, said the body as a physical entity had an undeniable role in contemporary theatre and dance. “The body is the most perceivable medium of the actor and dancer on stage. Bodies are controlled by various powers that constantly regulate, oppose and restrict the possibilities of how human bodies can exist in a space. ITFoK brings together tales of our bodies that wage and witness wars, bodies that are waiting, seeking refuge, bodies that are excluded, burnt alive, suffocated, and bodies that do not fit within the bounds of race, caste, colour and gender,” he added.At a press meet here on Saturday, P.V. Krishnan Nair, secretary of the Kerala Sangeeta Nataka Akademi, said ITFoK would present a range of newly formulated performances, which would be an engaging visual treat for the audience.Through ‘Meet the Artist’ sessions each morning at the festival, theatre buffs will get an opportunity to understand the process that went into the making of performances.Besides plays, various cultural performances such as Chakyar Koothu and Mohiniyattom will be performed. Film screenings, radio drama and a painting exhibition will be part of the festival.
