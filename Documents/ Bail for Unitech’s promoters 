: Hours after they were remanded to judicial custody, a Delhi court on Monday granted interim bail to Unitech’s chairman Ramesh Chandra, its two managing directors and a director, in a case of not refunding booking amounts to two customers.The company had earlier promised before the State Consumer Forum and later before a Sessions court to refund the booking amounts to the two customers, Sanjay Kalra and Devesh Wadhwa.The complainants had booked properties in Unitech’s Habitat Apartments project in Greater Noida.They had approached the consumer forum seeking refund of the booking amounts when the company failed to give possession of the properties within the promised time period.The complainants submitted before the court that despite its earlier order, Unitech had not refunded them the complete amounts.Additional Sessions Judge Vimal Kumar Yadav granted bail to Unitech Chairman Ramesh Chandra, its managing directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra and director Minoti Bahri till January 14 after they gave an undertaking that they would clear all pending dues to the two complainants.“The applicants are ready and willing to honour the undertaking given before the state consumer forum/ sessions court with regard to the payment to be made to complainants. In view of the same, since the complainant is also not opposed to the grant of interim bail, therefore, the applicants, Ramesh Chandra, Ajay Chandra, Sanjay Chandra and Minoti Bahri are admitted to interim bail till January 14,” the Judge said.Earlier in the day, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gaurav Rao had sent company’s office-bearers to 14-day judicial custody when they appeared before him on a non-bailable arrest warrant, rejecting their argument that due to financial constraints and circumstances beyond their control, they were not able to make the payment to the complainants.Accused have been charged in a case of not refunding booking amounts to two customers
