Offering better security cover to the shoreline off Kozhikode coast, the second coastal police station of the Kerala police in Kozhikode district is ready for opening at Vadakara. The building constructed at a cost of Rs.45 lakh will be opened after getting clearance from the government.Senior police officers said the station would get a well-trained team of policemen with modern facilities and boats to carry out sea patrolling.“The work so far handled by the local police would be handed over to the coastal police team,” they said.It was in 2012 that the project got approval from the government. Police officials pointed out that it was given priority as part of the efforts of the State and Union governments to tighten coastal security and prevent all possible attempts to misuse the coast for anti-social and extremist activities.Important locationVadakara was one of the important locations in Kerala, which was selected for the project.“Unlike the local police, the policemen to be appointed at the Coastal police station will be trained in meeting all possible challenges off the coast. They will be given the required number of patrolling boats and will operate under the District Police Superintendent,” said Deputy Superintendent of Vadakara M. Pradeepkumar.The building was constructed on the Vadakara sand bank utilising the 24-cent land handed over by the Revenue department. Though the project was expected to be completed by 2014, problems in handing over the identified revenue land stalled the project.
