A.S. Dulat, former chief of India’s external intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), has said that the head of the agency should have an extended tenure, as it required a longer period to understand the job thoroughly.In an interview with The Hindu here on Sunday, Mr. Dulat said he was an “accidental chief” but enjoyed his tenure and the three-and-a-half years at the Prime Minister’s Office till 2004.“The only regret I had in the RAW was that I was chief for a year and a half. I wished I had a little more time,” he said.Referring to the current norm of a two-year tenure, he said, “If only the ‘two years’ rule was there at that time, I would have got six months more as a consolation. You do feel that these jobs need a slightly longer tenure.”The chief of Britain’s external intelligence agency MI-6 has a five-year tenure. “Not only that. Most of them, when they retire, are knighted. It goes with the job. In India, once you are out, kalaas, finished!” Mr. Dulat said.Asked to comment on the charges that the RAW had earlier funded banned organisations like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Hizbul Mujahideen, the former chief evaded a direct answer.“Let me put it like this, if the agency is funding somebody, they are not saints. That’s for sure, whoever they may be. [In] our business also, we deal with more sinners than saints. And it is the sinners, who are actually useful. You don’t want saadhu aatma working for you,” he said.
