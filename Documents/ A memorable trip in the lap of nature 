Visualise this. You board a bus in Hyderabad, minus the official laptop but a bag loaded with your camera, a pair of high-powered binoculars and just a couple of tees and bermudas, apart from a chaste dhoti and kurta in case you prefer a visit to the temple too!The bus takes you from Hyderabad on what holds enough promise to be a memorable journey. After crossing the Forest Department check-post at Mannanur, the first stop is at Farahabad, where a breath-taking viewpoint greets you after a few kilometres stretch of dense Nallamala forest. You whip your camera out and take all the pictures you wish, including ‘selfies’ and ‘vidfies’ with a smartphone.An hour later it is onwards to ‘Mallela Teertham’, the waterfalls bang in the middle of the Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve and then the sight imposing, larger-than-life Srisailam dam and the large water spread too, make visitors shoot more photographs. After a pass-through that affords a glimpse of ‘Paaladhaara and Panchadaara’, two very thin trickles of waterfall from a height, it is time for a darshan of ‘Sakshi Ganapati’.As one reaches Srisailam, it is time to check into rooms and quickly freshen up before heading out for a darshan of Lord Mallikarjunaswamy before dinner and getting ready for a night’s sleep. On day two, those interested can have a second darshan at the temple, before going down the ropeway to ‘Paatala Ganga’ to board a boat. The five-hour cruise over the waters of the River Krishna has a visit to Akka Maa Devi temple en route and lunch on board before touching Somasila.At Somasila, there are a couple of rooms at the Haritha Resort run by the TS Tourism Development Corporation (TSTDC) and take in the serene view of the backwaters, apart from also visiting the Someswara Temple. And then its back to business, to work, on a drive that is bound to be with a few regrets. All this will be a reality within a fortnight and the road-cum-forest-cum-river-road circuit is bound to attract those in the concrete jungle, says TSTDC Chairman Pervaram Ramulu. He goes on to add this could possibly be a one-of-its-kind combination of a long drive, a pilgrimage, a glimpse of the forest and wildlife and a river cruise with lunch on board.All this will be a reality within a fortnight and attract those in the concrete jungle,Pervaram Ramulu,TSTDC Chairman
