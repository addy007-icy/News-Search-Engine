The City Crime Branch police have arrested a couple for cheating a retired teacher to the tune of Rs.20 lakh.Police said Franklin (49) of Langarhana Street in Palayamkottai and his wife Jeba Sheela (45), who is working with a private school here, used to help R. Matilda Mary (59), a retired teacher in withdrawing money from the bank and the ATM.After winning the trust of Mrs. Matilda, a widow, the couple borrowed money from her and allegedly withdrew money from the old womanâ€™s bank account without her knowledge.When Mrs. Matilda came to know about her money being swindled by the couple, she filed a complaint with the City Crime Branch. Though the couple managed to obtain an anticipatory bail from a court here, Mrs. Matilda filed an appeal in the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court which cancelled the bail.Subsequently, the Crime Branch police arrested Franklin and Jeba Sheela on Monday.
