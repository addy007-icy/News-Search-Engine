With rain staying away, the Public Works Department (PWD) has commenced the repair of various road stretches in the State capital.Several roads in the city have remained un-motorable in the post-monsoon period with authorities being unable to undertake maintenance owing to intermittent rains. Repairs got underway a few days ago on nearly 60 km of roads such as the Jagathy junction, Maruthamkuzhy-Sasthamangalam and Edappazhinji-Pangode-Thirumala roads.The other roads identified for repair works are Vattiyurkavu-Kachani, Edappazhinji-Vazhuthacaud, Sasthan Kovil-Model School junction, Uppidamoodu-Ayurveda College, besides various stretches managed by the PWD in the Fort region. The department is also undertaking renovation of the Peroorkada-Manikanteswaram-Nettayam road.The repair works on the Plamood-PMG stretch were taken up recently. A stretch of around 100 m, in front of the Lourdes Forane Church, was re-laid with interlocking concrete blocks. The particular choice of construction material was necessitated by frequent leaks from the water supply line.An official said the KWA could not locate the source of the leak. The blocks would be easier to replace in the event of at the time of pipe-bursts or water seepage. The decision to lay the blocks was also taken in view of a similar work undertaken on a 120-m stretch on the Ambalamukku-Muttada road, which was found to be satisfactory.Works to be launchedCertain works have also been arranged to be launched within a few days. These included repairing a 600-m stretch in Vallakadavu and a certain portion along the Pettah-Kannammoola route. The latter is expected to benefit vehicles headed for the Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital.
