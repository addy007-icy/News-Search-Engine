The arrest of comedian Kiku Sharda by Haryana police for his alleged mimicry of self-styled godman Baba Ram Rahim Singh is another sordid instance of the growing intolerance in our country. Such incidents are extremely hazardous to an advanced and evolving democratic society like ours. It is pertinent here to note that Kiku had only reportedly tried to mimic Ram Rahim Singhâ€™s acting. It is difficult to understand how that can harm anyone.Hemant Kumar,Ambala
