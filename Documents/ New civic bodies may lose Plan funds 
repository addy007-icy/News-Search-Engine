The 28 newly-formed municipalities and Kannur Corporation are likely to lose a major component of the Plan funds allotted for the current year since the government has not yet authorised them to draw the funds for executing the schemes. Execution of the schemes is coming to a halt.Following a flood of requests from the new urban local bodies seeking allocation and authorisation for implementing officers to draw the funds from the treasury, the Finance Department issued a set of guidelines on December 15 last.Operational hasslesMany of them complained of operational hassles and a new set of guidelines were issued on December 21. But the government has not so far completed the allied formalities and the implementation of Plan schemes is remaining crippled, sources said.Since the municipalities were formed by merging panchayats, they are implementing the Plan projects already prepared and cleared by the panchayats in the beginning of the financial year. Consequent on the modification of the number of local governments in different tiers, the Accountant General had to issue a fresh treasury code to all new local governments, including the municipalities and the Kannur Corporation to facilitate the withdrawal of funds. The Finance Department has to complete the procedures in this regard.The Accountant-General has not yet issued the code and the funds for completing the projects left at the disposal of the civic bodies have also dried up. With hardly two months ahead, they have to go on a overdrive to ensure optimum utilisation of the Plan funds.Municipal chairpersons say that rules governing the civic bodies do not have a spill-over provision. Which means the fund apportioned for the year should be spent before March 31 or they would lose it. Owing to the paucity of funds, they are unable to even complete the ongoing schemes. Though the Finance Department has clarified that the transfer of Plan funds from the accounts of panchayats that have been upgraded as municipalities has been exempted from treasury restrictions, such exemptions may not be in force in the event of a grave financial crisis.
