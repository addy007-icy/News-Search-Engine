Over 75 people converged on a construction site in Siruseri on Saturday to protest against the delay in the handing over of flats they had booked in a project on Old Mahabalipuram Road.Members of what is called Green 201 Owners’ Welfare Association said they had booked flats in a project by Green Tree Homes and Ventures, which, association members said, had assured them that about 400 flats would be constructed in five towers.The project, called ‘Green 201,’ is located just behind the Siruseri IT Park and was launched in 2011.According to association members, the builder had promised to hand over one set of apartments by July 2013; but the construction was stopped midway.Association members said they had approached Chennai City Police Commissioner and filed a complaint and that they had been assured that an enquiry would be launched.A. Balaji, secretary of the association, said the builder’s administrative office at Alwarpet remains closed and directors of the firm had resigned.“I have paid Rs. 32 lakh for a flat and my father had invested all of his retirement benefits, which amount to Rs. 30 lakh, in the flat. All of this have gone down the drain,” said Shalini, a buyer. Attempts to contact the builders’ office for a response proved futile.
