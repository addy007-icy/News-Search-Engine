The Forest Department is looking forward to rope in private sponsors for establishing a Children’s Park in the Vellode Bird Sanctuary campus.The Department has already approached a few educational institutions for funding, and has also made a representation to the Revenue authorities to hand over a few acres of poromboke land in the adjoining area for the purpose.There has been a gradual rise in the number of visitors to the bird sanctuary, but the sightings are possible only in the early morning and late evening hours. During the course of the day, the visitors are able to spend only little time walking along the pavements and gazing at water and greenery.Creation of a Children’s Park will make the visits valuable, more so, since the Department has started levying entry fee over the last few months, official sources said.The Forest Department has approached a few educational institutions for funding
