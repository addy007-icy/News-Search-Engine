The All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF) has decided to oppose the move to create the Rail Development Authority of India (RDAI).Talking to The Hindu on Tuesday, S. Gopikrishnan, Thiruvananthapuram division general secretary of the Southern Railway Mazdoor Union (SRMU), said the regulator RDAI is a ruse to privatise the Railways.Railway unions will not hesitate to launch a strike to oppose the RDAI on the models of the historic strike organised 40 years ago.The SRMU is an affiliate of the AIRF. Mr. Gopikrishnan alleged that the RDAI is part of a conspiracy by the Union government to snap Parliament’s control over the Railways. Not only railway employees but also the people of the country would be badly hit by the move, he said.“Peoples representatives cutting across party affiliations should join hands to oppose the RDAI,” he said.The RDAI was mooted by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu in the 2015-16 Railway Budget based on a recommendation of the Bibek Debroy Committee report.Uploaded on websiteThe concept paper of the RDAI was uploaded on the website of the Indian Railways on Monday inviting comments and suggestions from the public by January 30.The RDAI is then proposed to be enacted by Parliament.As per the concept paper, the RDAI will undertake four key roles: fixing tariff; ensuring fair play and level-playing field for private investment in the Railways; determination of efficiency and performance standards; and dissemination of information.Mr. Gopikrishnan said the RDAI forms part of the Modi government moves for wanton privatisation of public sector undertakings.“If the RDAI comes into effect, the cost of railway tickets will meet the fate of air ticket charges. The fare will be unbearably inflated as per the demands of the season and other conditions.”He said that under the guise of restructuring the Railways, the RDAI is being established to hand over the Railways to private players.The RDAI was mooted in the 2015-16 Railway BudgetBibek Debroy Committee report recoomended it
