A City Civil Court here has dismissed with costs a civil suit moved by Dow Chemicals Private Limited (Dow), which owns the Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), claiming damages to the tune of Rs 10 lakh for business loss, defamation and loss of reputation due to an agitation staged by environmental activists in 2009, demanding fair compensation to the victims of 1984 Bhopal gas leak tragedy.The VII Additional Civil Judge, K. Dhanasekaran, dismissed the plea as the company failed to produce any document in support of its claim. Dow Chemicals initiated the civil suit against environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman, International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal and four other organisations.According to the plaintiff company, the activist gathered a mob which assembled outside their premises at Tamarai Tech Park here.“The activists held inflammatory and defamatory placards, banners and raised aggressive and abusive slogans against the company and distributed defamatory materials as press releases and pamphlets,” Ramolla Karnani, director (Legal) of the company, said in his affidavit.Claiming that the company incurred a loss of Rs 10 lakh due to the protest, it sought a direction to the defendants to jointly compensate the loss.‘Case pending’Mr. Nityanand Jayaraman submitted that the liability of the company as the successor of the UCC was a matter pending before the courts of Bhopal and Jabalpur and the same could not be adjudicated by the City Civil Court.The protest was peaceful and did not affect the business activity of the company, Mr. Nityanand said.‘Damages arrived by the company for the loss is unsustainable in the eye of law’
