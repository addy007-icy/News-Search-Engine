Just as your flight is landing, you get a glimpse of the city that is to be your destination. More often than not, it is an exhilarating moment.A ‘skyline’ is defined as the outline of land and buildings defined against the sky. Every city has its own unique skyline.From time immemorial, humans have tried to build high structures. But sometimes, it becomes necessary to build high because there is no horizontal space. There is even competition to see who can build the highest, and the title has changed hands several times. Today, the world’s tallest building is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE. The skyline in most of the desert countries are probably relatively new, but they are also the most unique.If you were to touch down in Sydney, Australia the first sight to catch your eye would be the Opera House. Similarly, landing in London, you could see the Thames as it meanders through the bustling city amid the tall buildings. Hong Kong and many cities in the world welcome you with a breathtaking view of skyscrapers. But probably, one of the most recognisable skylines of the world would be the Eiffel Tower in France, the Golden Gate Bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay, and the iconic statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that overlooks the city with Sugar Loaf Mountain in the background. In Malaysia, the Petronas Towers takes pride of place.In contrast is Jakarta, Indonesia is a land of contrasts. It has western style skyscrapers and high rises scattered throughout the city, that is dominated by traditional Indonesian culture. Similarly, in Central America, Panama City is dotted with modern high rise condos and hotels along its waterfront.
