A Jamshedpur-based electrician, alleged to be an al-Qaeda’s Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operative, has been arrested by the Delhi police.Sources told The Hindu that the suspect, Abdul Sami, had also conducted a recce of Delhi before moving to Mewat in Haryana from where he was arrested on Monday. Senior officers said Sami had undergone a year’s training at Lashkar-e-Taiba’s camps in Pakistan and was set to be given a “major task” soon.Abdul Sami is the fifth suspected AQIS militant arrested by the Delhi police in the recent past ever since this module was busted in December last year. The previous arrest was that of a madrasa teacher from Bengaluru on January 6.The police said they learnt of Sami’s AQIS links during the interrogation of Abdul Rehman, another suspect arrested from Cuttack in mid-December. “Sami and Rehman knew each other since 2001,” said a senior officer.Sami was only 16 years old when he had allegedly met Rehman during a religious ceremony where the latter delivered “provocative speeches to motivate Muslim youth to take to jihad.”A native of Jamshedpur and an electrician by profession, Sami is the second suspected AQIS militant from that place to be allegedly indoctrinated by Rehman and sent to training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.Police said that Sami’s brief interrogation so far has revealed that he first visited Dubai on a work visa in January 2014 and then entered Pakistan for training with the help of LeT agents based in the two countries.Having obtained training in “using sophisticated weapons, preparing bombs, dealing with internet and computers,” Sami returned to India in January last year, said police.“He returned to India via Sharjah and Kathmandu. He was set to be given a major task, but was temporarily told to lie low,” said the officer. Fear of being nabbed made him flee his hometown and reach Nuh in Haryana’s Mewat region. He was produced before a city court that sent him to police custody till February 1.
