A powerful Improvised Explosive Device (IED), suspected to be planted by the Maoists, was recovered from Adava police station limits of Gajapati district of south Odisha on Sunday.The bomb in a tiffin box was located near Paniganda forest beat house when the security personnel involved in combing operation in the region came across a suspicious-looking wire protruding from below the ground. The bomb disposal squad was rushed to the spot for its disposal. According to Gajapati Superintendent of Police Satyajit Nayak, this IED contained around ten kg explosive materials and could have caused a lot of harm to civilians or security personnel.Initial evidences hint that the IED may have been planted by the ultras in 2009. In July 2009, the Naxalites had blasted the Paniganda forest beat house. Before escaping from the area, the ultras had planted landmines in the area to target police patrols. During past few years, the Maoist presence in Gajapati district bordering Andhra Pradesh has come down to minimal level. “Although evidences hint that the recovered IED was an old one, yet combing operations have been intensified in all regions of the district that had Maoist presence in the past as precautionary measure,” said the SP.In October 2015, two powerful tiffin bombs were recovered from Adava police station area of Gajapati district. In August 2015, two other IEDs planted by the Maoists were unearthed by security personnel from Telangapadara, two kms away from Paniganda of same police station limits.
