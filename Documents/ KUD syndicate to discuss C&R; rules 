The syndicate of Karnatak University, Dharwad, has decided to convene a special meeting to deliberate on modifying the cadre and recruitment rules (C&R) to be followed while giving promotions to the employees in the university. A decision to this effect was taken during the syndicate meeting here on Tuesday after a syndicate member Harshavardhan Sheelavant took exception to the alleged violation of C&R rules in the university and demanded tabling of the report of committee, led by K.R. Aithal. According to sources, the contention of Mr. Sheelavant was that although there was a direction from the Governor on making departmental examinations mandatory for the promotion process, it had not been adhered to. However Registrar of the university M.N. Joshi told the meeting that a subcommittee led by R.K. Mulgund had been set up to look into the issue.Subsequently the alleged violation of C&R rules in Karnatak University, reached the Dharwad Bench of the High, with syndicate member Harshavardhan Sheelavant filing a writ petition seeking tabling of the K.R. Aithal committee report and quashing of the new committee led by R.K. Mulgund. The Bench ordered for issue of emergent notice to the University on the issue.When contacted, Vice-Chancellor of the varsity, Pramod Gai told The Hindu that after Prof. Aithalâ€™s report was placed before the academic council, the meeting authorised the Vice-Chancellor to proceed after taking legal opinion.
