Rasikas at Ragapriya spent a pleasant evening, regaled by flute music in Ramani’s style, by his disciple Ajith Ranganathan.M. Vijay Ganesh supported him on violin while Ashwin Sridharan provided the beats on mridangam.Ajith played the gentle tones of a Valaji varnam composed by Lalgudi, and then a few signature notes of goulai to preface ‘Pranamamyaham’ by Mysore Vasudevacharya and ended the song with kalpanaswarams.A taste of Dikshithar was offered through ‘Kanchadalaya Dakshi’ in kamalamanohari. Tyagaraja kritis included the pancharatnam in Sriragam, ‘Entaro Mahanubhavulu,’ ‘Rama nee samanamevaro’ in karaharapriya and ‘Ninnadanela’ in Kannada.Syama Sastri's ‘Marivere’ in Anandha Bhairavi provided a good interlude. The main song ‘O Ranga Sayee’ had the flautist and violinist use their creative skills in delineating Karaharapriya and display the variations of kaalams that the kriti lend itself to. The keen play of mridangam throughout the song and solo played later were appreciated by the listeners.A thillana in Nalina Kanthi by Ramani and Bharathi’s ‘Enna tavam seithanai’ were the final songs, while the audience had expected to listen to at least a couple more of such simple and short renditions.Altogether it was a proud moment for the performers’ teachers and well-wishers among those assembled there, for these musicians hail from Madurai.RAJALAKSHMI PADMANABHAN
