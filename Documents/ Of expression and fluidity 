Clad in a beautiful green and pink costume, Shobana began her performance on a vibrant note with an anjali in Chakravaham with striking anjali hasthas and postures.Following a quick depiction of the Thyagaraja kriti, ‘Rama Nannu Brovara’ by her disciple, Shobana portrayed Lord Siva in all his glory in the ragamalika, talamalika varnam, ‘Sada kalam aadum Natarajane’.The composition offered scope for a dramatic narration by the dancer and Shobana’s abhinaya kept the audience engrossed. The Thinnappan story was beautifully dealt withAn appealing sequence was where a hunter with bow and arrow moves at a slow pace, which quickens to transform into the gait of a deer, leading to stretched out movements depicting the hunter again carrying the dead deer.The sequence where she depicted the sringara of Parvathi was one of intense abhinaya, but in some portrayals such as the Daksha story, the expressions were overdone.The nritta sequences added vibrancy to the varnam and the precision with which her footwork matched the arudis on the mridangam displayed Shobana’s nritta calibre.The Sahana padam, ‘Moguduchi’ composed by Sarangapani and the Khamas javali, ‘Apaduru’, depicting two different emotions, one pining for the hero and the other full of innocence, stood out for their lovely sancharis. The ease with which the dancer’s face captured these emotions was enchanting.A Lalgudi Jayaraman thillana in Desh marked by graceful movements was followed by a Mahishasura stotram depicting the attributes of the mother goddess. These two made for a fitting finale.
