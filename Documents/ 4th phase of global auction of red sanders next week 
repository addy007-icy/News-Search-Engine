After failing to evoke encouraging response from bidders in the previous auction, the Andhra Pradesh government is expecting fourth phase of the global sale of seized red sanders logs to fetch Rs.1,000 crore to the State exchequer.A top official of Andhra Pradesh Forest Department told The Hindu that “good response” was expected in the ensuing three-day global e-tender-cum-e-auction, beginning on January 12. If all the stock put up for auction gets sold, it would fetch around Rs.900 crore to Rs.1,000 crore, the official added.After finding the bids received in the third phase not to be encouraging, the State government cancelled them and decided to go for fresh tender for the entire quantity of 2,868 metric tonnes Asked about the pre-bid meetings held in China by the State officials, he said although the market was a bit “slow”, there was a demand and a good response was expected this time. While more than 25 prospective Indian and Chinese buyers have visited Central Warehousing Corporation’s godown at Renigunta and inspected the stocks notified for sale, the Forest Department has convened pre-bid meeting with them here on January 9. In a bid to get a better response from buyers, the government reduced the upset prices for different grades of red sanders logs in the fourth phase as compared to the third phase. The starting price for A grade was reduced to Rs.30 lakh per MT from Rs.52 lakh, while that of B grade was brought down to Rs.20 lakh from Rs.38 lakh per MT and C grade to Rs.12 lakh from Rs.21 lakh.The Director General of Foreign Trade permitted Andhra Pradesh government to export 8584 MTs of red sanders in log form and complete the entire process by April 30. In the first phase conducted last year, a total of 2,694 MTs were sold fetching Rs.855 crore to the State’s coffers. However, the response was poor in the second phase and only 830 of the 3,500 MTs were sold yielding a mere Rs.178 crore.
