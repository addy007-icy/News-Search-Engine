The State capital seems to have a sinister bond with suicides. Figures compiled by the police in 2013 and 2014 indicated that one person took his or her life on a daily basis in Thiruvananthapuram.The figures for 2014 included those of a family of five in Mannanthala and those of two children who lost their lives in a similar group suicide bid. Last year, the situation was no different, with the tally including the death of an actress, whose body was found in the Karamana River; that of two lovers found dead in a hotel room; that of a youngster who allegedly jumped to his death after being questioned by the police; and that of an accused who ended his life inside the Thumba police station.The year drew to an end with the deaths of Jasmine, her daughter Fathima and Jasmine’s sister Sajina, with the former two found dead in the Akkulam Lake and Sajina, on the railway tracks near Pettah the next day. Barely two weeks in to the new year, the trend remains the same. A man, who stabbed four persons, was found hanging from a tree inside the Anappara forests. The same day, though the suicide angle is yet to be confirmed, the incident in which a man and his son died after their car crashed into a quarry was recorded.The reasons cited by those who left behind suicide notes were different. The methods they chose were different. But one thing remained common – that of people losing the heart to fight it out, or at least, to seek help from others, including the police, when they found themselves with their backs against the wall.Whether there is anything that the police or other social organisations and government agencies can do, is something that has to be urgently debated upon.(Reporting by Dennis Marcus Mathew)
