“Women are being subjected to violence and atrocities from ‘womb to tomb’,” State Commission for Women Chairperson Tripuraneni Venkataratnam has said.No legislation can curb atrocities against women until social outlook changes and parents ensure equality in the upbringing of their children, she added. Ms. Venkataratnam was inaugurating a two-day legal literacy awareness camp for self-help group women and ICDS employees at the Kurnool Collectorate here. “The girl child is being killed in the womb owing to gender bias, resulting in a fall in the number of women compared to that of men,” she said.“Young as well as aged women are being subjected to atrocities and sexual abuse, not to mention women patients being sexually abused at hospitals,” she said.She also exhorted SHG women to develop awareness about various Acts.Two-day legal literacy awareness camp for SHG women and ICDS employees begins at Kurnool Collectorate
