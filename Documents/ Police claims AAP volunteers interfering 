: The Traffic Police have had enough of AAP volunteers at the car-free day events. In a letter to Transport Minister Gopal Rai, the Traffic Police chief has requested that party volunteers not be deployed in future car-free days.It was uncertain if the strongly-worded letter had any impact on the government because the volunteers returned with placards and roses to the North Delhi roads where the voluntary event was conducted on Friday.Special CP (Traffic) Dr. Muktesh Chander had sent the letter to Mr. Rai on January 18. The letter focused on the “problems” for by the traffic police in ensuring smooth flow of traffic during the third car-free day organised in East Delhi on December 22.“…due to the continuous unwanted interference of AAP volunteers, transport department and Disaster Management Authority of GNCT, who had absolutely no experience and knowledge of traffic management, problems were experienced,” Dr. Chander wrote.He wrote that the police had already made “adequate arrangements” for the day taking into considerations the massive volume of traffic and public who would be affected by the planned restrictions.He said that the traffic police had been managing the city’s traffic in a dedicated and professional manner and should be allowed to go about the job without any interference from the volunteers.The first two car-free days in the city had seen the traffic police mostly remain mere spectators as volunteers and Delhi Government officials went about requesting motorists as well as forcing some of them to take alternative routes.But senior traffic officers said they have now “had enough”. “Car-free day is a voluntary exercise and no one can be forced to keep off a stretch of road unless there is a notification to this effect,” said a senior officer.“The volunteers often go about forcing car drivers to take alternative routes and enter into arguments with the unwilling ones. This has been leading to congestions in the middle of roads,” the officer added.Volunteers often go about forcing car drivers to take alternative routes and enter into arguments with the unwilling ones.
