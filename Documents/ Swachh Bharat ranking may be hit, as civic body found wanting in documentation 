Coimbatore’s Swachh Bharat ranking may take a hit as the civic body was unable to furnish documents the Swachh Bharat auditors asked for. Sources say that the Corporation had a tough time explaining its waste management work to the auditors as it did not have supporting papers to back its claim.The absence of these means lower marks and therefore poorer ranking vis-à-vis other cities.The auditors from Quality Austria-Central Asia who were in the city to record the city’s waste management initiatives asked for documentation of various initiatives.The Corporation was left red faced because it did not have many of the documents the auditors asked to see.User chargesAnd, another area where the civic body failed was in not collecting user charges – Rs. 10 a month – from households for solid waste management, something it had promised at the time of getting funds for the solid waste management programme under the JNNURM scheme.In the last ranking of 476 cities, the city was placed at the 169th position. Senior officials declined to comment on the issue.
