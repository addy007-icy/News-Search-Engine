Promising to step up efforts to minimise corruption in elections, State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy urged journalists on Saturday to spread awareness among voters.Speaking at a media gathering organised by the Telangana Working Journalists’ Federation (TWJF) and Hyderabad Union of Journalists (HUJ), Mr. Reddy said the corporation spends Rs. 10,000 per year on a voter through its budget. Only by increasing the voting percentage, it is possible to hold corporators responsible to all localities in a ward. “Corporators may simply work in a few localities and ignore the rest to ensure their voter base remains satiated. The budgetary spend on voters will only increase during the five-year term,” he said in a bid to emphasise the importance of a high voter turnout in the upcoming GHMC elections. When asked about the measures taken to address election corruption, the election commissioner said that the tolerance for impersonation is only 0.01 per cent of the votes.“The earlier tolerance limit was two per cent. If we find that the number of votes by impersonators is higher than 0.01 per cent, we will go for a re-poll,” he said. “We can however know about impersonators only if bona fide voters come to booths to cast their vote.” Mr. Reddy also said that February 2 will be declared a public holiday to ensure higher voter turnout and that his office will write to private organisations to give employees time to vote.Tolerance for impersonation is only 0.01 per cent of the votes.V.
