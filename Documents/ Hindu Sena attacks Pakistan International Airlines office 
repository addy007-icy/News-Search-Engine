Asserting that no talks should take place between India and Pakistan, activists of a right-wing group on Thursday vandalised the regional office of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) at Barakhamba Road here.Of the four Hindu Sena men who barged into the PIA office and damaged furniture and gadgets on Thursday afternoon, one has been arrested while three others fled before the police arrived.According to the police, they went to all three rooms of the office, located on the fifth floor of Narayan Manzil building, and caused damage all around. The activists upturned the chair kept at the reception and also damaged a replica of the aircraft run by PIA.Questioning the purpose of talks at a time when the Indian Air Force Base at Pathankot was attacked recently, the activists also left behind a few pamphlets documenting both their objection and a warning.The message written in the pamphlet blames Pakistan for the recent attacks in Pathankot and the Indian consulate in Afghanistan and through it the outfit has also called for a complete severing of ties with Pakistan unless it hands over all the anti-India elements to India.It further warns that the Hindu Sena plans to stop the Delhi-Lahore bus service and Samjhauta Express between the two countries.Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Jatin Narwal who reached the office after the incident said the arrested person has been identified as Lalit Singh, a member of Hindu Sena.He added that no individual was injured or manhandled.However, a statement issued by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Islamabad said the activists also “harassed and threatened the PIA staff.”“The Pakistan High Commission immediately took up the matter with the (Indian) Ministry of External Affairs, asking them to provide adequate security to the PIA offices in New Delhi and Mumbai, as well as to take action against the miscreants. We have been assured by the Indian government that it would take all the necessary steps for the security of the PIA offices in India,” said the statement.As an added security cover, nearly two dozen men from the Central Reserve Police Force were sent to the PIA office. Senior Delhi Police officers said that security would be enhanced around all installations connected to Pakistan if there is a threat perception.
