The Kerala Water Authority will wait for further direction from the State government to act on the recommendations made by the Kerala State Mineral Development Corporation Limited (KEMDEL) to improve storage capacity of the Aruvikkara reservoir.Minister for Water Resources P.J. Joseph had convened a meeting last week to discuss the report submitted by KEMDEL. “We have been asked to submit the report to the government. Probably next week we will submit the report along with our observations. The foremost thing about going ahead with the recommendations will be allaying environmental concerns on dredging,” a KWA official told The Hindu .Reacting to the report submitted by KEMDEL, local MLA K.S. Sabarinadhan said the government should examine the pros and cons of carrying out dredging. “A detailed study has to be conducted before taking up any work,” he said. He had submitted a report to the KWA seeking to remove wasteaccumulated in the reservoir. The work would cost around Rs.15 lakh, he said.
