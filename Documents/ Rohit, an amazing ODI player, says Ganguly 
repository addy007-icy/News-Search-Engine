Applauding the record-breaking unbeaten 171 that Rohit Sharma scored against Australia in the first ODI of the series at Perth, former India captain Sourav Ganguly called the Indian opener an “amazing player” who makes the game look easy while batting.“He (Rohit) was exceptional, the way he batted today. In one-day cricket and at top of the order he is as good as anybody in the world. He makes the game look easy when he gets going. He is an amazing player in the shorter format of the game,” Ganguly said in a function where he was named the captain and ambassador of Libra Legends in the upcoming Masters Champions League to be played in Dubai from January 28-February 13.“He is a terrific one-day player, and it surprises me that he does not turn this into big performances in Tests,” Ganguly said.“I thought India would have defended 310 as it is a big target anywhere in the world,” he said.Ganguly also praised left-arm pacer Brainder Sran, who took three wickets on his debut, breaking through to see Australia struggling at 21 for two.“I think Australia — and more specifically, Perth — is the place for any fast bowler to make the debut. He (Sran) bowled well in these conditions. He is tall, bowls close to the stumps… I think he has got a lot of promise. India needs good young pace bowlers,” Ganguly said.
