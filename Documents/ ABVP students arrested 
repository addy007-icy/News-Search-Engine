Police arrested about 50 ABVP activists and shifted them to the Fourth Town police station when they tried to lay siege at the Collectorâ€™s office here on Thursday, demanding the immediate release of fee reimbursement.Earlier, there was high drama for a few minutes with the guarding police personnel and the parishad activists pushing each other before the main gate. At last, the police could manage to overpower the agitating parishad members and dispersed the cadres taking the leaders and main activists into custody.Speaking on the occasion, ABVP sanghatana secretary Mogulappa accused the government of passing the time in releasing the fee reimbursement amount with different statements every day. The Chief Minister was doing injustice to the students after achieving the separate State and using the support of student movements, he said.The government needs to release Rs.60 crore arrears for the year 2013-14 and Rs.1,400 crore for 2014-15. For the current year, it did not receive applications by deferring the dates frequently. With the delay in release of amount, college managements were harassing students for payment of fee, he said.Like farmers who were committing suicides with the failure of crops and increasing burden of debt, the college managements would also end life if the fee due to them was not paid, said the ABVP leader. He warned that the parishad members would stop the movement of ruling party MLAs, MPs and Ministers if the fee reimbursement were not sanctioned.
