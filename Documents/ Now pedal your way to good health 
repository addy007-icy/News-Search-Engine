Transport Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday inaugurated the ‘Green Ride Public Bicycle Sharing Service’ at the Rohini Metro station here. Dedicating 66 cycles that can be hired by those so inclined on an hourly basis to the Aam Aadmi Party government’s first phase of promoting cycling in the Capital, the Transport Minister said the service aimed at improving the health of Delhiites and the air they breathe. “We will work on the cycling plan in two phases. In the first, we will encourage people to use cycles for daily chores. We have already announced that the government will give a subsidy on purchase of cycles. The second phase will consist of constructing cycle lanes on roads so that people can use cycles for longer commutes,” Mr. Rai said. Atul Jain, founder-cum-director of Delhi Cycles, a private organisation assisting the Delhi government with the initiative, said the cycles up for hire were available at Rohini (East) Metro station, apart from DMRC facilities located in Sector 8, 13 and 14.“These can be hired for Rs. 10 per hour. The number of cycles is expected to go up to 100 by the end of January,” Mr. Jain said.According to a senior government official, a similar cycle renting service was available in the area around the year 2009, but it had to be stopped due to operational issues.As many as 66 cycles are available for Delhiites at a minimal cost ofRs. 10 per hour
