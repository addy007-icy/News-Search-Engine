With conventional methods, such as penalties and suspension of the licences, not yielding results, the Electronics City traffic police have come up with a novel experiment to ensure that violators fall in line. On Thursday, they flagged down 40 violators. But instead of penalising them, the violators were felicitated with a shawl and a rose.Mohammad M.A., Electronics City Traffic Inspector, said that they mainly targeted three types of violators â€” BMTC drivers who made unscheduled stops, jaywalkers and motorists not wearing a helmet.At the same time, on spotting a few pillion riders wearing a helmet, they stopped them and offered sweets and a rose.
