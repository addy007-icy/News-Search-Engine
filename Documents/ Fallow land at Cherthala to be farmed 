The fallow land under the Cherthala Assembly constituency will be converted into arable land in a phased manner. A plan of action, prepared by the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), has been approved by the peopleâ€™s representatives concerned.As per estimates, the constituency has 640 hectares of fallow land. The extent of fallow land varies from 20 hectares in Kadakkarapally grama panchayat to 160 hectares in the Muhamma grama panchayat limits.ReasonsThe reasons behind the vast expanse of land remaining fallow have been found to be varied.These include scarcity of labour, high labour charges, infertility of soil, disinterest in farming among people, lack of suitable agricultural machinery, poor water evacuation system, and lack of proper land access to machinery for use in farms.In the initial phase of the project, the land has to be identified separately, with the corresponding survey numbers.A detailed report on the reasons applicable would have to be made in respect of land in each area, in the second phase of the project.The third phase will focus on making irrigation facilities by increasing depth of canals and by construction soil protection embankments on canals.Preventing salty waterMethods would have to be adopted to prevent incursion of salty water into cultivable lands.The projects could be associated with employment generation schemes suitably. A cost-benefit ratio of each work would have to be prepared during the third phase.The projects proposed in the third phase would be implemented in the fourth phase. Funds would have to be deployed from MP fund, MLA fund, and other available resources.A year-wise plan would have to be drawn for execution of projects in each area, subject to fund availability.Action planThe action plan has proposed finishing of the first phase in 2015-16 and the commencement of second phase in 2016-17.The third phase would have to be completed in 2017-18 and the fourth phase by 2018-19.Fourth phase of project to be over by 2018-19Plan of action prepared by KILA
