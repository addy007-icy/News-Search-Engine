: Land owners in Krishnayapalem village in Mangalagiri mandal on Wednesday passed resolutions against a proposal in draft master plan of capital earmarking the site meant for burial ground to a reservoir.The resolutions, signed by village Sarpanch Eevoru Kannaiah, opposed the move to take over the burial ground and also urged the Capital Region Development Authority to remain committed to its earlier assurance of changing the alignment of the express highway.“We have also passed a resolution stating that if the CRDA allots an alternative site facing north, each one of us will pool Rs.1 per square yard and contribute to the construction of a burial ground,’’ said Karumanchi Anil, managing partner in Harika Cable Vision.The show of open defiance by the land owners, most of them supporters of the Telugu Desam, has stumped the Ministers and the CRDA, forcing the latter to start a dialogue with influential leaders in the village.This development comes after Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu cautioned the land owners against opposing the master plan and warning that their opposition could result in fall in land values.It is not the first time that land owners in capital villages have shown signs of anxiety over the draft master plan. Earlier, villagers of Inavolu in Thullur mandal also passed a resolution demanding that the CRDA stick to its earlier stand of not disturbing the village boundaries.If this trend of village panchayats passing resolutions continues, it could spell trouble for the State government keen on starting the work on building a capital after the release of the final master plan.Trouble began on January 6 when an awareness meeting on the draft master plan drew protests from some farmers. The protests continued even as CRDA officials tried to put a brave face in the face of persistent demands from land owners that they be allotted reconstituted developed plots facing north or east and in locations of their choice.
