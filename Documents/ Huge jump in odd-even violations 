The second day of odd-even road rationing scheme saw a big jump in traffic violations.The figure released separately by the Delhi Traffic Police and the Transport Department showed that the number of fines issued were close to 500 on Saturday as compared to 283 on the maiden day of the scheme.Enforcement officials attributed smoother conditions given the relatively lesser number of vehicles on the streets of Delhi on a Saturday.The figures were released as Transport Minister Gopal Rai who, for the second consecutive day, boarded a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus to assess its effect on the ground terming it “successful” and an instance of the birth of “a new, collective consciousness” among the people of Delhi to contribute towards a people-driven movement aimed at lowering pollution.“Rules and government policies cannot change anything in isolation; a change of mindset is needed to affect real change which is at the core of the experiment and precisely what the government aimed at. This tangible change is what is on display on day two of the implementation of the scheme too,” Mr. Rai said.The Transport Minister boarded a DTC bus from the Delhi Secretariat which then plied through Indraprastha Estate, Nizammudin, Sarai Kale Khan, Ashram, Nehru Place and India Gate before concluding at the point of origin.It is pertinent to mention here that the bus carrying Mr. Rai along with a contingent of media personnel almost had a minor accident near the Millennium Bus depot.Responding to queries related to whether he was hopeful of similar compliance from drivers on Monday, the Transport Minister expressed confidence yet again.Meanwhile, the Transport Department is scheduled to preside over a day-long maintenance exercise aimed at sprucing up the working condition of a fleet of 3,000 private buses procured under the Paryavaran Bus Sewa to minimise break-downs and ensure smooth functioning underlined by buses running at peak frequency for the convenience of an estimated 1.5 lakh commuters.
