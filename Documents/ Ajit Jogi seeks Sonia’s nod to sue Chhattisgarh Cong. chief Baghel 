After an audio recording revealed that he was purportedly involved in fixing an Assembly by-election in Chhattisgarh, senior Congress leader Ajit Jogi on Sunday said he had sought permission of the party high command to file a defamation suit against the State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel.“In a letter to AICC president (Sonia Gandhi), I have sought her permission to file a defamation suit under both civil and criminal laws against Baghel,” Mr. Jogi said here.“Baghel’s remarks regarding the audio tape, which is doctored and fake, has tarnished my image. He publicly made inappropriate comments against me which is a violation of the party constitution,” Mr. Jogi said at a press conference.Mr. Baghel declared the audio tape to be authentic without any scrutiny, Mr. Jogi said, asking how he came to the conclusion.The telephone conversations in the tape, purportedly between the Chief Minister Raman Singh’s son-in-law Puneet Gupta, Ajit Jogi, his son Amit, Jogi ‘loyalists’ Firoz Siddiqui and Ameen Memon, revolved around rigging of the by-poll to Antagarh Assembly seat in 2014.Congress candidate Manturam Pawar, considered to be close to Mr. Jogi, withdrew from the fray just a day before the last date for withdrawal. Mr. Pawar was later expelled from the party.The tape suggests that the money changed hands in the affair, facilitating BJP candidate’s victory.Mr. Baghel had claimed that the party was aware of Mr. Jogi’s role in Mr. Pawar’s withdrawal.Mr. Jogi said that in another letter to the high command, he also revealed who hatched the conspiracy to tarnish his image.“I have informed them about the conspiracy against me in which party leaders from the State and Delhi are involved,” he said.He further claimed that someone tried to blackmail his son Amit Jogi.“Before the tape row started, Amit had received text messages demanding ‘books’ from some ‘BB’ The messages threatened if certain demands were not fulfilled, some audio CD would be disclosed. Amit, however, lodged a complaint with the additional director general of police.”To a question, Mr. Jogi said he had told Mr. Pawar (before he got the ticket) not to contest as he had lost in the general election from that seat, and in the by-poll the ruling party would put in all its strength to win.“After he was given the ticket I congratulated him but said I will not be available for campaigning. After that I was not in touch with him,” said Mr. Jogi. PTI
