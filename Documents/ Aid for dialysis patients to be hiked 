Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has said that the State government will seriously consider hiking of financial assistance to dialysis patients.Speaking at a Kudumba Sangamom (family get-together) of those who have undergone kidney transplantation and their donors at the Kottayam Medical College Hospital on Sunday, Mr. Chandy said at present the financial assistance from the Karunya Benevolent Fund for patients undergoing kidney transplant had a ceiling of Rs.2 lakh. However, it had come to the notice of the government that a large number of patients were not able to cope with the recurring expenses they had to bear.‘‘Some of the patients have to shell out up to Rs.20,000 a month,’’ he said and added that the government would seriously look into the request for enhancing the financial assistance from the Karunya kitty. He said the pension scheme for kidney patients had met with certain bottleneck. ‘‘However, this will be sorted out soon and pension, along with arrears, will be disbursed soon. Mr. Chandy said 10 additional dialysis units would be sanctioned for the hospital.This was the only government medical college hospital which was not benefited by the Karunya scheme for dialysis units, he pointed out.
