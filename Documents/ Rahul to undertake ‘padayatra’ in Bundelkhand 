A day after returning from Europe, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is warming up for a ‘padyatra’ in the drought hit district of Bundelkhand, Uttar Pradesh.Since the State is set to go to polls next year, Mr. Gandhi has sent instructions to the Pradesh Congress Committee in Lucknow that they should identify villages that are severely affected by drought and famine.At Tuesday’s meeting, several Congress leaders suggested that the party should be cautious if it ever ends up negotiating an alliance with the BSP.
