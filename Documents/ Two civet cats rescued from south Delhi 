Two Asian palm civets were rescued from Greater Kailash-II earlier this week by the Wildlife SOS Rapid Response Unit. The animals, which are under observation, will be released into their natural habitat shortly.A call to the Wildlife SOS helpline (9871963535) alerted the team to a strange, unidentified animal at a house in GK-II.Upon arrival, the team found that a civet had managed to enter the courtyard, causing panic among the bewildered residents who contacted the local police.The police, unable to capture the animal, gave the residents the number for the Wildlife SOS helpline.Adding a twist to the story, another civet cat was discovered in the same home later that day.This time the residents knew who to call.One of the owners of the house, Ms. Shipra Ghose said: “The Wildlife SOS team is evidently well-trained and well-equipped. They did a commendable job rescuing the animal both times. It is great to see an organisation taking up work like this and carrying it out this efficiently.”“Delhi still has a few patches of forest that are home to such unique wildlife. It is essential that we remain sensitive to the presence of wild animals,” said Geeta Seshamani, co-founder of Wildlife SOS.Kartick Satyanarayan, who is also a co-founder of Wildlife SOS said, “It is the need of the hour to educate people about wildlife conservation and habitat protection. Wildlife SOS has a dedicated team that works round the clock to protect wildlife in distress.”Delhi still has a few patches of forest that are home to such unique wildlifeGeeta SeshamaniCo-founder of Wildlife SOS
