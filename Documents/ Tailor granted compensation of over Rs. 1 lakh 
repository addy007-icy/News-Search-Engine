Declaring the termination of a tailor’s services as illegal, a Labour court here has awarded a compensation of Rs. 1.4 lakh to him.Stating that the management illegally terminated the services of the man, Additional Sessions Judge Narinder Kumar said: “Having regard to all the facts and circumstances, the nature of employment, rate of monthly wages, factum of non-payment of earned wages, length of service, illegal termination of services and inconvenience , pain and agony suffered by him, as a result of his illegal termination, this court deems it is a fit case to allow him a lump sum compensation to the tune of Rs. 1.4 lakh.”The worker, Manoj Kumar, had joined private company A.D. Gear International as a tailor in 2010.He alleged in his claim that the management had not issued any appointment letter and offered facilities like an attendance register, leave book, pay slip, provident fund and Employees’ State Insurance. But when he claimed these facilities, he was only offered assurances. Themanagement ultimately terminated his service, withholding his earned wages for March and for 13 days in April, 2013, Kumar said.Responding to the charges, the management said the worker had quit voluntarily after remaining absent. At the same time, it expressed readiness to take him back without back wages.The Judge, however, dismissed the management’s contention saying that “it has failed to prove any record regarding absence of the workman from duty”.“Even otherwise, had the claimant absented from duty, the management would have sent letters to him asking him to resume duties or show cause notice for his absence.The management would have initiated disciplinary action against him for absence from duties. But there is nothing on record,” the Judge observed.
