The All India Forward Bloc will continue to align with the AIADMK for the ensuing Assembly elections, said its general secretary, Debabrata Biswas. The party had contested the 2011 Assembly polls in the AIADMK-led alliance.Addressing journalists here on Wednesday, Mr. Biswas gave a clean chit to the Jayalalithaa administration. “It has been a good administration . The government has handled the unprecedented flood situation very effectively,” he said.Stating that the law and order in West Bengal had worsened under the Mamata Banjeree Government, he said people feared to come out late in the night there. “With bitter experience in West Bengal, I would say Tamil Nadu is a heaven,” he said.When asked about the two major Left parties in the State which opposed the AIADMK and were part of the People’s Welfare Front, Mr. Biswas said that the AIFB cannot be blamed for it. “We wanted the CPI and the CPI (M) to take the responsibility for AIFB too in forging alliance with the AIADMK. But, both the parties took unilateral decision without taking AIFB into confidence,” he said.
