The adventures of Charlemagne and Biblical legends came alive at the Chavittu Nadakam competition that was held for higher secondary school students at the Government Girls HSS, Cotton Hill auditorium, on Friday.Visual treatThe visual experience of the colourful art form ensured a decent audience that gathered at the venue. The costumes of Chavittu Nadakam that has a marked European influence along with the exaggerated movements of the performers make for a viewing that is in contrast with most other dance forms.According to Thampi Payappilly, a Chavittu Nadakam artiste who has been training students for several years, the performances were assessed on the basis of various parameters including the presentation, rhythmic and synchronized movements of the performers, their costumes and make-up, among others. Even while the folk art is largely restricted to certain areas of Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Thrissur, Mr. Payappilly pointed out that there were still many viewers for Chavittu Nadakam at festivals.
