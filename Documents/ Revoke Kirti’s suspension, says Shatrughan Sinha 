BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Tuesday disagreed with his party’s >decision to suspend Kirti Azad, saying the decision was not sending a “good message” as Mr. Azad was being seen as fighting “corruption.”He told PTI that the party should revoke the suspension.Mr. Azad, the BJP’s Darbhanga MP, was suspended from the party just after the winter session of Parliament for openly alleging corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association when Arun Jaitley headed it.Referring to Mr. Azad as “a worthy son of a worthy father” – a reference to Mr. Azad’s father Bhagwat Jha Azad who was Chief Minister of Bihar — Mr. Sinha voiced support for party veterans like L.K. Advani, who have questioned the present leadership after the Bihar debacle. He rued that party president Amit Shah did not involve him in the Bihar polls. “I found it very unfortunate that Azad, a worthy son of a worthy father, was suspended in this way. What has the general perception gone out? That he was talking about corruption,” Mr. Sinha said.Mr. Advani is releasing Mr. Sinha’s autobiography ‘Anything but Khamosh’ (Anything but Silent) in the capital on Wednesday.
