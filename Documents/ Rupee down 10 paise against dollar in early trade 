The rupee was trading lower by 10 paise at 66.92 against the dollar in early trade at the Interbank Foreign Exchange on Thursday on sustained foreign fund outflows amid increase demand for the U.S. currency from importers.Moreover, China devalued yuan by 0.51 per cent and lower opening in domestic equities also weighed on the rupee, dealers said.The dollar was weak against major global currencies, capping the rupee losses, they added.The rupee had closed lower by 22 paise against the U.S. dollar at 66.82, its lowest level in more than two-weeks in Wednesdayâ€™s trade on the back of frantic demand for the American currency.Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell further by 326.26 points or 1.28 per cent to 25,079.97 in early deals.
