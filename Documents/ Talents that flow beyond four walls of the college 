For the students of Government Fine Arts College here, the annual degree show is a much awaited event. With few platforms available in the city for them to express their creativity, the annual show organised by the college inside the campus is where they exhibit their best works.On display at the exhibition are paintings, sculptures, etchings and works of applied arts. Capturing the attention of the viewer walking into the main gallery is a large format surreal painting of a few headless bodies entangled each other in a garden-like setting.A series of four portraits in square frames capture various moods, mostly bordering on the despondent, of four different personalities. Another striking work recreates one of the corridors of the college building, filled with old shelves. A landscape with a rather innocent looking dinosaur appears as a surprise to the viewer.Another one depicts a human hand, with a kitchen glove on one of the fingers, holding an eye. One of the highlights is a scene depicting a goat on the branch of a tree, with a half-eaten jackfruit on its head, on top of which is sitting a crow. On a side stand, sits a butcher’s knife.SculpturesThe sculpture section offers rare glimpses into the thought process of the artists of tomorrow. The centre-piece of the sculpture gallery is a work made of white wires, resembling a hospital bed, twisted beyond recognition.On the sidelines, inside a small room, is an audio-visual installation by one of the faculty members, using firewood, LED lights and the sound of the artist’s own breath amplified through a speaker. Also organised as part of the show is a six-day experimental graphic workshop, by the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. College Principal A.S. Sajith inaugurated the workshop on Tuesday.
