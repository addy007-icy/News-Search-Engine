State co-spokesman of the Bharatiya Janata Party C.M. Nimbannavar has said that the ‘AHINDA’ politics being followed by the Siddramaiah-led Congress government would prove detrimental to the State.Addressing presspersons along with the party’s State vice-president M. Nagaraj here on Sunday, Mr. Nimbannavar said that the Chief Minister was only shedding crocodile tears on the sorry state of backward classes and had not addressed the issues concerning them so far.Referring to the utilisation of funds meant for welfare of SC/STs, he said that with only three months left in the financial year, the State government had only utilised 36 per cent of the funds, which actually showed the ‘real’ concern of it for the backward and exploited classes.He said that initiatives taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi including the recent ‘Bima Fasal Yojana’ and the new scheme for encouraging start-ups, were yielding results now and soon ‘good days’ would come.To a query, he said that the Union government had released grants for tackling drought in Karnataka and the State government should first utilise funds and submit utilisation certificate before seeking additional funds.‘Kuberappa will withdraw’On R.M.
