Senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and MP Saugata Roy courted controversy on Saturday by announcing that his party has decided to field former Minister Madan Mitra — who is behind the bars for his alleged involvement in the Saradha scam — in the upcoming Assembly polls.When contacted by The Hindu, TMC secretary general and Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said that no decision has been taken yet. He criticised Mr. Roy for making such “offhanded” remarks and pointed out that his comments do not reflect the party’s view.Addressing a party workers’ meeting at Belgharia in North 24 Parganas district, Mr. Roy said: “Madan [Mitra] will once again be our candidate from Kamarhati. This is the decision of our party. You have to work with the aim of getting him re-elected,” he told party workers amid loud cheers.Mr. Roy also assured them that if they remain on the “right track” Mr. Mitra will definitely win.Recently, while being produced in court, Mr. Mitra said that he will abide by the party’s decision with regard to contesting the Assembly polls.
