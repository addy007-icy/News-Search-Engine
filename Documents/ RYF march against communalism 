The Revolutionary Youth Front (RYF) has alleged that communal forces led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are engaged in unleashing communal agendas that tend to reconvert Kerala into ‘the lunatic asylum it was when Swamy Vivekananda visited the State’.In protest against such agendas at work, the RYF will march to Raj Bhavan on Tuesday and hold a demonstration there.At a press conference here on Monday, RYF State president C.P. Sudheesh Kumar said that both majority communalism and minority communalism was dangerous for the country. However, the bigger threat Kerala faced now was from the RSS. In order to create roots in the State, the RSS was engaged in creating communal flare-ups, Mr. Sushdeesh Kumar alleged.Through such an agenda, the RSS is out to demolish the entire achievements made by the State through the reformation movement. Superstitions and other ill beliefs, which had been erased from society, were being resurrected and imposed on the people, Mr. Sudheesh Kumar alleged. “The RSS even decides what the people of the country should eat, think and write.”He alleged that with the RSS-controlled Bharatiya Janata Party-led Narendra Modi government coming to power at the Centre, communal tension had increased. There were attempts to even pollute music and cricket with communalism.
