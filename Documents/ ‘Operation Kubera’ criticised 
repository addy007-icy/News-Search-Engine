: Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan has reiterated his charge that ‘Operation Kubera’ was really intended only to help usurers.In a statement here on Monday, Mr. Achuthanandan said in a case against a usurer in Mavelikara, based on a complaint from a homemaker, Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala and the officers had taken a stand in favour of the accused. The investigating officer was changed three times on his request to the Home Minister. The Kerala High Court has expressed suspicions about the ongoing probe given the history of the case. The court has sought a report from the State Police Chief, but Mr. Chennithala’s attempt is to make it appear that the Court’s directive is of routine nature, he said. — Special Correspondent
