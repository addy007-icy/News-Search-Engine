The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the Delhi government to submit a status report on the medical condition of former Indian National Lok Dal MLA Ajay Chautala, who has moved a petition seeking his release on parole for 12 weeks for medical treatment. Chautala is serving 10 years' jail term in the teachers’ recruitment scam case of 2000.Chautala has sought quashing of the Delhi government’s November 16, 2015 order by which his parole application was rejected.He has approached the court with the plea for release on parole to “get medical treatment and maintain social ties”.The Bench of Justice Ashutosh Kumar asked the Delhi government to file the status report before January 29 in the case.The appeals of Ajay Chautala and his father, former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, against their conviction and sentence were dismissed by the Supreme Court on August 3 last year. The father-son duo and 53 others were convicted by the trial court here on January 16, 2013, for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior basic trained teachers in Haryana in 2000.
