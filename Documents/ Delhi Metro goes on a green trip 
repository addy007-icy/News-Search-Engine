In another green initiative, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started a drive of recycling waste paper from its offices.The DMRC on Sunday claimed that in the past five months, since the project took off, it has so far recycled over 8.80 tonnes of waste paper, which has resulted in saving considerable amount of power and water along with curtailing carbon emissions.“We had conducted a survey to gauge the results of this drive and it revealed that as much as 15.84 MW electricity was saved during this period. Similarly, water consumption avoided was 2200 KLD (Kilo Litres per Day) while waste water generation resulted in savings of about 61.60 KLD,” said a DMRC official. Apart from this, adequate reduction in coal consumption, bamboo consumption was also recorded, he added.The DMRC had decided to recycle and reuse waste paper generated from the offices of the Delhi Metro in August last year.“Following this, a specialised agency was roped in for the purpose and waste paper baskets were installed at all offices requesting the employees to dump waste paper in those baskets,” said another official.The agency then collected the waste paper, recycled them for use and delivered it back to the Delhi Metro authorities. With this initiative, DMRC has been substantially able to reduce the consumption of fresh paper since a bulk of its paper requirements are now fulfilled by recycled waste paper.In the past too, the Delhi Metro has recycled other waste materials such as horticultural waste, wooden materials, SS steel sheets, etc, which are now being reused after recycling. “The kitchen and horticultural wastes generated is converted into compost and used for gardening purposes. A carpentry shop has been opened using packing wood of equipment and dismantled steel pipes. Broken tiles are being used for waterproofing of rooftops of buildings and new barricades are being made from broken SS pipes of broken railings,” said the official.
