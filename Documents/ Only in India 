There’s never a dull moment on our Indian roads. Look around and you get to see uncommon sights. While, the roadsides are open air theatres that act out scenes of life, on the road itself you can never be sure of what you can catch sight of. Whole families find it convenient to clamber on to their scooter to go off on a day trip. Sometimes, a pet dog needs to be taken to the vet and what better way than on the bike? Have you seen a dog perched on the petrol tank, enjoying the cool air that hits against his face. One sight that remains etched in people’s minds is of the woman in a burkha riding pillion, holding her school-going toddler dressed as Lord Krishna, on her lap all set for Krishna Jayanti celebrations. Another common sight is cycle rickshaws piled high with balloons or plastic ware winding their way through the streets. While vendors at traffic lights, cows resting on the medians and gods taken in procession are common enough, what is not common is the sight of a bicycle that has been modified to look like a motorbike, but continues to work like the cycle. Visitors from foreign shores are sometimes shocked, sometimes amused but surely not bored by all that goes on our roads. There is never a dull moment and there is no predicting what can happen next. And, whatever anyone says, these roads will teach you patience.
