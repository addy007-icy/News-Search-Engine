Activists of Left parties and CITU on Tuesday asked the government to stop forcible land acquisition in Srikakulam district under the guise of developing the backward region. They pointed out that the State government’s acquisition plans would lead to displacement of thousands of families in the mandals like Ranasthalam, Polaki, Narasannapeta, and Sompeta.The plan of the government was to acquire around 10,000 acres of land in the district for construction of a nuclear power plant in Kovvada of Ranasthalam, Sumitomo thermal project in Polaki mandal, Bhavanapadu port in Santabommali mandal and multi-product industry in Sompeta region. The government has not yet conducted any public hearing in those places but began acquisition process violating all the rules and regularisations, they alleged.CITU general secretary D. Govinda Rao and others staged a protest at Day and Night Junction and burnt the effigy of the government. They vowed to protest forcible acquisition and move the court in necessary. “Srikakulam does need polluted industries. Moreover, the government keeps all villagers in the dark without divulging its plans over land acquisition. We will organise combined agitation and seek the support of non-governmental organisations and political parties also,” he added. Several CITU and Left workers were taken into custody when they tried to disrupt the traffic at the busy junction.
