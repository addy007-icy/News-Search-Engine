The Indian banking sector could expect some respite from bad loans that have increased sharply over the last three years with ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service, and its unit ICRA, stating that the pace of growth in non-performing assets will moderate over the next 12-18 months.“While the stock of non-performing loans may continue to rise, the pace of new impaired loan formation in the current financial year ending March 31, 2016, will be lower than the levels seen in the past four years,” said Srikanth Vadlamani, a Moody’s Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. This will result in the banks’ credit matrix stabilising, according to the ratings agency.The ratings agencies noted fresh NPA generation had moderated during the first half of the current financial year despite withdrawal of regulatory forbearance. Banks are now mandated to make standard restructured asset provisioning on par with NPA provisioning from April 1, 2015.According to RBI data, gross bad loans in the banking system increased to 5.1 per cent of gross advances as of September 2015, from 3.4 per cent in March 2013. During the same period, stressed assets, which are defined as gross NPA plus standard restructured advances, increased to 11.3 per cent from 9.2 per cent.The ratings agency noted that while public sector banks reported some moderation in their bad-loan ratios during the first six months of the financial year ended March,31, 2015, their holdings of weak standard assets represented 2-2.5 times their total gross non-performing assets.“Nevertheless, of these weak assets, only 25-30 per cent were classified as stressed,” Moody’s said.ICRA said that while credit growth for the public-sector banks may remain low until at least end-FY17, such growth is still likely to outpace internal generation, thereby adversely affecting capital adequacy.The ratings agency estimate public sector banks need to raise Rs.3.3 lakh crore of tier-I capital between FY16 and FY19. The government has said that it will infuse Rs.70,000 crore in the public sector banks in four years, starting from this financial year. “With current plan to infuse Rs.70,000 crore, credit growth will have to drop to 8-10 per cent,” ICRA said.
