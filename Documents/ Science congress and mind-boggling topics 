The 103rd edition of the Indian Science Congress being held in Mysuru is reportedly set to court controversies, as in the previous editions, if a few topics listed for the symposium and plenary sessions are an indication.The programme schedule released by the organisers mentions a presentation of a paper titled ‘Blowing of Shankh – an indigenous tradition for fitness and wellness’.The paper is to be presented by the Additional Commissioner of Kanpur Rajeev Sharma on Monday, as per the programme schedule. This is being held under the Anthropological and Behavioural Sciences (Including Archaeology, Psychology, Education and Military Science) section.Though there are articles on the “health benefits” of the blowing of the shankh, in public domain and online, a casual perusal of these articles indicate they are not evidence-based science.The ISCA has also listed a special lecture under environmental science for January 6 on ‘Lord Shiva as a greatest environmentalist in the world’. This is slated to be delivered by Akhilesh K. Pandey, chairman, MP Private University, Regulatory Commission, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.While it is not clear whether the paper will be presented or the lecture held as scheduled, their inclusion in the programme schedule indicates that they are on.This is contrary to the claims of the organisers that they will discuss only pure science and will not allow storytelling in the guise of science.The previous science congress at Mumbai in 2015 had its share of controversies and one of the papers claimed that aircrafts existed in ancient India.Incidentally, Minister for Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan, had claimed an Indian origin to the Pythagoras theorem in the same meet.Paper on ‘Blowing of Shankh’ has been listed to be presented in the schedule
