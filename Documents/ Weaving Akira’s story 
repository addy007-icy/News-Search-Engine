The winners of the YW Storyteller competition were in for a surprise! Earlier this month, when they returned to school after the weekend they were greeted with gifts from Young World.Akira, our little heroine, got to live through several stories, thanks to the remarkable and irrepressible imagination of our readers. Twelve of the stories, however, made it to the pages of Young World, bringing our heroine to life and twisting her destiny with different endings!The fate of Akira hung in the balance (and in your hands), and what a twist many of you had given to her story! In many stories, our fearless heroine went on to become friends with “the witch”, in others, she defeated the witch, putting an end to her wicked ways, and in another, Akira managed to get trapped, sealing her impending doom.From Uttarakhand and Mumbai to Hyderabad and Chennai, Akira's stories poured into our mailboxes. And we thank you for all the love you have shown to Akira and Young World, and your continued supported is appreciated.The winners received gift hampers worth Rs. 1,000 from Camlin.
