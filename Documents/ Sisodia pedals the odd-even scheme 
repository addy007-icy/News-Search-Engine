Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia opted for a bicycle to get to work on Saturday, the second day of the odd-even scheme in the city. The first day of the scheme had seen Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal carpooling with some ministers, while others preferred to come to work on motorbikes, in buses and even in battery rickshaws.Mr. Sisodia, whose official residence is on Mathura Road, first cycled to the office of the All India Radio to take part in a live show. Later, he cycled to the Delhi Secretariat.“Good Morning Delhi! Ready for Day 2 in fight against corruption with #OddEvenFormula. Day 1 was a great success (sic),” Mr. Sisodia, who owns an odd-numbered car, tweeted on Saturday morning.“I’ll cycle to AIR and would be in 102.6 FM studios at 8.30 a.m. Then would cycle to my office from AIR,” Mr. Sisodia’s next tweet read.On his way to his office, Mr. Sisodia spoke to people who were also going to work, particularly those on cycles.He told a news channel that he was riding a bicycle to understand how the odd-even plan was working for the public and the problems they were facing.The Deputy Chief Minister added that if the government had made a rule, it should follow it too.The Deputy CM first cycled to the office of the All India Radio to take part in a live show
