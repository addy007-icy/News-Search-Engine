APCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy will address Kapu leaders and activists striving for a place in the Backward Classes list at a meeting in I V Palace here on Sunday.APCC general secretary and Kapu leader Akula Srinivas Kumar, addressing a press conference on Saturday, said that a meeting was being held to discuss the options before the community in the wake of the government appointing a Commission to make a study and recommend terms for the inclusion of Kapus in the BCs list and the State government not fulfilling its election promise of allocating Rs.1,000 crore per annum for the Kapu Welfare Corporation.Mr. Srinivas Kumar said there was no doubt whatsoever that it was the Kapu vote that brought back Telugu Desam to power and the party was therefore obliged to fulfil the promises it made in the election manifesto.Instead of sending an Assembly resolution to Parliament demanding inclusion of the Kapu community in the BCs list, the TDP government constituted another commission as a delaying tactics, he charged. Though the TDP said that it would allocate Rs. 1,000 crore per annum, the party announced just Rs. 100 crore in the second year.Mr. Srinivas Kumar said the Congress also said that it would include Kapus in the BCs list in its election manifesto and it would have done that had it been elected to power. The Congress was therefore putting pressure on the ruling party to fulfil the promises it made to the people, he said.The APCC president himself was taking the initiative in this matter and the Congress announced that it was going to constitute a Kapu Cell to address the demands of the community, Mr. Srinivas Kumar said.The Congress and its cadres were suspicious about the intensions of the TDP because several erstwhile Congress leaders who deceived the Kapu community in the past had defected to it.“We do not want the Kapus to be deceived again,” he said.The meeting would also be addressed by leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council C. Ramachandraiah and former Minister Vatti Vasanta Kumar, he said.
