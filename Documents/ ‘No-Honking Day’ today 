Young Indians-Kochi will observe Tuesday as No-Honking Day by initiating its Horn Not OK Please (HNOP) campaign at Vyttilla Mobility Hub and Vyttila Junction.“The whole world is alarmed at air, water and land pollution. But there’s a deafening silence about noise pollution. Be it human or machine-created, noise disrupts normal activity and balance of life. Honking by motorists is the largest source of noise pollution in the world.Yi-Kochi has taken the responsibility of spreading awareness and initiating action at the community level to stop the growing menace of incessant and often unwanted vehicle honking through the HNOP campaign,” said Vivek, the chapter’s chairman.
