The idea of development and a robust “Make in India” programme cannot be possible unless we empower workers and not exploit them (“Labour’s love lost”, Jan.1). The proposed changes to the Factories Act will be discriminatory towards factories with a workforce of less than 40, while changes to the way bonuses are disbursed will be discriminatory towards contract workers. The system is being unfair in the name of increasing so-called productivity. The disparity between managements and workers cannot be solved unless the workforce is genuinely made a part of the corporate system and given due importance in the “Make in India” plan.Fatema Diwan,MumbaiMost Indian workers toil within small establishments and tin sheds without any rights or a guarantee of their welfare. The writer has relied too heavily on using the familiar class warfare rhetoric to bat for the relatively privileged workforce in large corporations. We need to look at how the largely informal workforce can be brought into formal arrangements with registered companies, and where their rights can be better monitored and protected.Rama Siva,New DelhiLiberalisation may be creating more jobs, but for most, the working conditions are pathetic and earnings abysmally low. A multiplicity of labour laws presents operational difficulties. Besides this, terminology like ‘employee’, ‘workman’, ‘worker’, ‘wages’, ‘basic wages’, ‘salary’ and ‘CTC’ are used differently. One can say that the labour class faces misery. Fast shrinking public health services and a lack of medical insurance have only compounded a worker’s woes.V.K. Babu Prakash,Kollam, Kerala
