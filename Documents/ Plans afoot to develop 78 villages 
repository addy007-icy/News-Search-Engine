Efforts are on to develop as many as 78 villages which acquired hundred per cent individual sanitary lavatories into model villages under the Nirmal Bharath Abhiyan, according to Collector Ms. Yogitha Rana.With this, the employment guarantee scheme, women welfare, medical and health, education, rural development and poverty alleviation schemes could be effectively executed, she said, and wanted the officials to meet targets given under different departments with coordination.To prevent child and mother mortalities, pregnant women must register their names at primary health centres and anganwadis, she said. She said in the current month alone many pregnant women died of anaemia, delay in the supply of iron and lack of immunisation due to non-registration of names of pregnant women.Ms. Rana said for all pregnant women, all kinds of medical examinations worth about Rs.1,500 would be done free of cost at PHCs.Surgical equipment for medical examinations were purchased with Rs.13 lakh to distribute them to health centres, she said.
