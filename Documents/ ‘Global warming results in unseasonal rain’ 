KALABURAGI: Chief Executive Officer of the Karnataka Science and Technology Academy (KSTA) H. Honne Gowda has said that changes in the climate, due to rapid industrialisation and indiscriminate use of fossil fuels, was primarily responsible for global warming which has affected the weather.Speaking at the two-day KSTA conference on Energy, Climate Change and Environment sponsored by the Central University of Karnataka (CUK) here on Friday, Dr. Gowda said that global warming had led to unseasonal rain, melting of polar icecaps, receding glaciers.“The recent floods in Tamil Nadu was the effect of induced climate change and the unseasonal rains and global warming has given rise to new potent diseases and the world is facing one more threat from Zika virus playing havoc on the health of the people and spread to more than 20 countries,” he said.Dr. Gowda said that global warming had also induced several changes in the flowering pattern of the plants and the number of the migratory birds visiting different countries has drastically come down.He said in the past ten decades global average surface temperature has risen from 13.7 to 14.3 degrees Celsius and global average sevel from 10 to 20 cm.Against the desired forest cover of 31 per cent, Dr. Gowda said that India had around 18 per cent forest cover and of this only 11 per cent was closed forest.
