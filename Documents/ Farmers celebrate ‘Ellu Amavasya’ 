‘Ellu Amavasya’, the harvest festival similar to Thanksgiving in the West, was celebrated across Hyderabad Karnataka and some north Karnataka districts on Saturday.Some farm families though, plan to celebrate it on Sunday as the ‘Amavasya’, New Moon Day, falls partly on that day.Farmers and zamindars packed their food and went to their fields to have lunch with family and friends.Cuisine for the outdoor lunch is unique in that it consists of all the grains and vegetables harvested in the rabi and late rabi season.A make shift temple made from sugarcane tops is made in the middle of the field and five stones are worshipped as Pandavas.Jowar rotis, groundnut chutney and karindi, the sun dried chilli sauce, are the starters. But the authentic ‘Ellu Amavasya’ dish is the bhajji, made from grain, millets, lentils, green leafy vegetables and green chillies.Spicy and hot, it adds the real masala to the outing.“Most of the dishes last a week long without refrigeration,” says Mangala Markhale, a resident of Aliambar who celebrated the festival with family and friends.The idea behind this festival is to express gratitude to mother nature, she said.
