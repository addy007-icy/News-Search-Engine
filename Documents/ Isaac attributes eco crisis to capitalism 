The imbalance in man-nature relations is due to social reasons and man has been constantly transforming Nature disregarding his duty to protect and conserve it for posterity, former Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, MLA, has said.Dr. Isaac was delivering the keynote address at a national seminar on climate change, organised by the CSI Department of Ecological Concerns, at the Eco Spirituality Centre at Othera, near Thiruvalla, on Friday. According to him, capitalism destroys nature and the world finds it difficult to tackle the ecological crisis created by this counter-productive capitalism.He said that environmental issues started gaining public attention following the publication of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring in 1962 and the subsequent ban on DDT. Silent Spring has made a powerful idea that if humankind poisoned nature, nature would in turn poison humankind.Man’s heedless and destructive acts, no doubt, would bring hazard to the humankind and the world at large, he said.
