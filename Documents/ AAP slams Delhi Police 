Following an ink attack on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during a ‘thanksgiving’ interaction after the completion of the odd-even scheme, the Aam Aadmi Party launched an all-out attack on the Ministry of Home Affairs-administered (MHA) Delhi Police alleging that a political conspiracy was behind the incident.“The Aam Aadmi Party condemns the incident of ink attack at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues during a public function at Chhatrasal Stadium today. The incident is not just a major security breach, but it points towards involvement of Delhi Police officials in the conspiracy,” the AAP said in a statement.Alleging laxity on part of the Delhi Police, the party alleged, it was ‘unimaginable’ that in this state of alertness, an ‘ordinary woman easily breached’ the security cordon of the Delhi Police and attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The statement added that it wasn’t the ‘first such attack.’In response, the Delhi Police issued a statement terming the allegations against it as “misconceived and unfounded.” According to a senior police officer, ‘appropriate law and order arrangements’ were made for the said function which was held at the Chhatrasal stadium on Sunday.“In fact, enhanced police deployment was made for law and order maintenance in view of the large crowd expected to attend the function. The deployment includes one company of armed police and police personnel from local police. As far as personal security of Hon’ble CM is concerned, adequate cover is provided by Delhi Police which includes Escort, Pilot and PSOs,” the statement said.A team of security unit performed anti-sabotage check before the function and the team was covering the CM at the time of incident, the statement added.Meanwhile, Bhavna who was detained at the spot for throwing ink at Mr. Kejriwal has been booked under Sections 186 (Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.Her formal arrest, said a senior officer, was likely by Sunday night when she would be produced before a duty magistrate. “These provisions are non-bailable,” said a senior officer, who, like the statement quoted above, sidestepped the question of women police officers not being present at the venue.
