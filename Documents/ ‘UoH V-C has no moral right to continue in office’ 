Telangana JAC chairman prof. M. Kodandaram said that the Vice-Chancellor of University of Hyderabad (UoH) has no moral right to continue in the office, as he acted atrociously in the case of the five Dalit students.Had the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Appa Rao Podile, responded positively and promptly to the first letter written by research scholar Rohith to him, he could have stopped his suicide. The suspended students came from a humble background and their hopes of getting liberated from the scourge of social humiliation and oppression were erased with the irrational and unbecoming attitude of the varsity authorities, he said.Unpleasant incidentsReplying to questions posed by mediapersons here on Wednesday, prof. Kodandaram said that the suicide letter of Rohith made everybody come to tears. Most unpleasant incidents took place in the UoH and what happened to the Dalit student was not justifiable. As head of an educational institution, it was the responsibility of Appa Rao to protect the rights and interests of students.Students may have difference of opinion . Just because having an opposite opinion on a particular subject one cannot be persecuted or prosecuted. Different ideological activities and opinions among students are common in universities, said prof. Kodandaram.He demanded a thorough probe into the incidents leading to the extreme decision of Rohith to serve justice to his family.
