N.K. Premachandran, MP, has called on Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Wednesday with a request to retain ESI medical facilities of the workers of cashew factories, including those of the public sector Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation, which are lying closed.Requesting Mr. Chandy to call a meeting of the officers concerned, Mr. Premachandran said in a statement here on Wednesday that he had submitted copies of the request to the Industries Minister and the Labour Minister.Because the factories were lying closed, the ESI dues of the workers were not being paid and this was why ESI medical facilities were denied to them, Mr. Premachandran said.He said even workers who required urgent surgeries and dialysis were being denied the facilities.The factories were closed for no fault of the workers. The workers of such factories who were entitled to holiday wages under the law were also being denied the same. This too had to be seen seriously, Mr. Premachandran told Mr. Chandy.Premachandran asks CM to convene meeting of officers‘Many require urgent surgeries and dialysis’
