There is now hope for several infrastructure projects that are in limbo owing to want of land, particularly defence land. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Ministry of Defence are close to inking a land-swap deal that will pave the way for the completion of 11 infrastructure projects.Joint surveyBBMP Commissioner G. Kumar Naik recently wrote to the Commander, Karnataka and Kerala Sub-Area, Indian Army, proposing swapping of 207 acres and 24 guntas at Thimmanayakanahalli in Anekal for 38 acres and 28 guntas of defence land in the city. “A joint survey of the identified land was also conducted and the defence personnel have responded positively to the proposal,” he said.The projects that will be cleared now include widening of six roads — Lower Agaram Road, Victoria Road, Ulsoor Road, Murphy Road, HAL Airport Road and Lasker–Hosur Road. The work on widening Banaswadi flyover, pending for over five years now, will also be revived. Work on two new roads between Gangammanagudi Circle and Jalahalli and between Ejipura Inner Ring Road and Sarjapura Main Road have also been cleared.Against TDRThe projects were held up as the Ministry of Defence refused to part with their landholdings in exchange of Transferrable Development Rights (TDR) offered by the BBMP. The MoD had insisted that the BBMP allot them land worth that the land the ministry would give up. The land-swap deal was initiated in August 2015 when T.M. Vijay Bhaskar was the BBMP Administrator.While defence officials have now responded favourably for the proposed land-swap deal, the MoD is yet to communicate its approval formally, sources said.
