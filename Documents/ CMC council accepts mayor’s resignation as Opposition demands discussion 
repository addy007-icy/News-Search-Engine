By the dint of its brute majority in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) council, the BJD corporators on Monday officially accepted the resignation of Anita Behera from the post of mayor.Her resignation was passed by a voice vote within four minutes without holding any discussions on it after it was tabled by deputy mayor Ajay Barik.The opposition Congress and BJP corporators, however, opposed the manner in which the resignation was accepted without having any discussions on the cause and content of the resignation letter.After it was revealed that Ms. Behera had managed to obtain a ration card in her name under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), she resigned from the post and as a city corporator on December 29.The CMC council was scheduled to officially ratify the resignation on the day and the deputy mayor tabled it proposing the special council to accept it. Soon, two BJD corporators seconded the proposal and other party corporators supported it, prompting the deputy mayor to announce that the proposal was passed in majority by voice vote.Even as the opposition corporators demanded a discussion on the proposal, Mr. Barik, without paying heed to them, declared the special council meeting closed and rushed out of the council hall along with other party corporators.“This is high-handedness and undemocratic on the part of BJD members in passing such an important proposal without discussion and we demand a fresh council election after dismissing the present one,” said Congress corporator Giribala Behera.All the BJP and some independent corporators also echoed similar feelings.Speaking to newsmen later, Mr. Barik said the special council was convened on the day only to ratify the resignation letter of the former mayor. “No such discussion, as demanded by the Opposition, was on the agenda,” he said.
