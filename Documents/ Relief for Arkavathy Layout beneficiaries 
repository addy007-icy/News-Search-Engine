There is relief to some of those waiting for their long-promised sites in Bengaluru Development Authority’s Arkavathy Layout.On Wednesday, the BDA assured 174 beneficiaries of alternative sites within the beleaguered layout.The massive layout underwent a series of denotification (labelled ‘Redo’ by the BDA). As many as 8,813 allottees were deprived of physical possession of their site despite being allotted plots nearly a decade ago. Since then, many have moved courts to obtain alternative sites. “This is an ongoing process and thousands have been able to get alternative sites. The others have been encouraged to move courts to put pressure on BDA to hand over sites in other blocks,” says G. Shivaprakash, head of the Arkavathy Layout Allottees Association.However, an allottee said many were hesitant to undergo the ‘long, arduous’ process of going to court and are instead approaching touts and brokers to get alternate sites. BDA Commissioner T. Sham Bhatt said, “Allotment is based on a seniority list. There is no necessity for court orders, as we will have to eventually give sites to all the original beneficiaries.” He ruled out the possibility of bribery. BDA secretary Kantaraj P.S. said the authority will make all efforts to clear litigations and free up sites.
