Deshpande Minister will chair a high-level meeting of officials and elected representatives on Monday to work out the modalities for pitching potential regions in the State as investment destinations at the meet.While many industrial houses including Coca Cola and pharmaceutical units have evinced interest in investing in the Badiyal-Kadechur textile park and industrial hub, the State government wants to project the proposed NIMZ at Chittapur as the next major investment destination before investors from other parts of the country.The government also proposes to highlight the incentives being offered to industrialists who propose to establish their units in Hyderabad Karnataka as per the new industrial policy.Priyank Kharge, Chittapur MLA, told The Hindu that the added advantage for investing in the NIMZ in Kalaburagi was the five-year tax holiday extended by the Union government.He said that the focus would be on food processing industries and meat processing units.
