Hugging each other, shaking a leg, interacting and dining, the elderly persons spent the entire day with loads of fun and unlimited music playing in the background.It was a time to rejoice and soak in the festive mood for those who assembled to celebrate Senior Citizens Day presented by Bayviz Welfare and Cultural Society on Sunday.From 60-year-old to over 90 years of age, the annual forum created an opportunity for many to brush aside their worries, share their strengths and weaknesses, and take part in several fun-filled programmes.After a few moments of ballroom dancing, Brenda and Clarence, a couple who came to the venue, said: “The real secret of staying happy lies in keeping ourselves engaged in a plethora of activities. This celebration is one such rare occasion. Though travelling and gardening continue to be on the priority list, meeting our friends is something that we can never miss.”In an era where ‘WhatsApping’ has become a norm, catching up with friends has turned out to be a luxury for some.“These days, people are so engrossed in their own world that they hardly find time for friends. This kind of event brings friends under one roof and allows them to reminisce the old times,” says Rudy, president of the society.The rest of the day was spent playing indoor games and sharing moments of togetherness.Charlotte Manuel, 96, said that it was imperative to maintain one’s health by following a nutritious diet and staying away from stress. She was accompanied by her daughters.Elderly persons come together and have fun on the occasionof SeniorCitizens Day
