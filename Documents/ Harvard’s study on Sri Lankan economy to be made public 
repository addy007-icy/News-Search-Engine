Findings of a study on Sri Lankan economy carried out by the Center for International Development (CID) at the Harvard University are expected to be made public on Thursday at the inauguration of a two-day event, said Sri Lanka Economic Forum.The CID has identified four themes, which will be deliberated at the event. The themes are: macroeconomic and fiscal stability; structural transformation and competitiveness; urbanisation and development, and regional development and social inclusion.International investor George Soros and economists including Joseph Stiglitz, Ricardo Hausman and Montek Singh Ahluwalia are scheduled to address the Forum.Explaining the rationale behind the event, a release issued by the CID stated that Sri Lanka experienced “exceptional economic growth” over the last decade which “builds upon strong historic growth in [terms of] both per capita income and broader measures” of living standards for most Sri Lankans even during the 26-year civil war.However, recent volatility in the factors underlying Sri Lanka’s economic growth revealed “several important and interrelated risks” to the economy overall and the inclusiveness of the development process. At the same time, well-designed and well-implemented policies addressing these risks could open new opportunities for “sustained and inclusive” long-term growth as Sri Lanka aimed to move from a middle-income country to high-income, the release added.
