Hailing the Union government’s notification clearing the path for organising jallikattu, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said she was “very grateful” to him for his prompt action.“I am very grateful to you for your prompt response, which has facilitated the conduct of ‘jallikattu’, a sport which upholds the cultural values and traditions of Tamil Nadu and also ensures the conservation of native germplasm and traditional breeds of indigenous cattle,” she said.Ms. Jayalalithaa recalled that she had “consistently” taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and several rounds of discussions had taken place between State and Central officials.Welcoming the development, DMK president M. Karunanidhi thanked all who had made efforts for the resumption of the sport. He recalled that the DMK planned a fast in Alanganallur in support of the event and cancelled it on the assurance from Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan that the Centre would intervene in the matter.Mr. Radhakrishnan said that without the PM’s help it would not have been possible to continue the sport.
