Senior Uttar Pradesh Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi on Friday approached the cyber cell and lodged a complaint against unidentified persons for posting objectionable material in her name on Facebook and some other social networking sites.The former Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president later told reporters that some “mischievous and fundamentalist people have posted my false statement with a picture on the Face book and some other social sites as part of a conspiracy.”Besides use of indecent language, Ms Joshi said that her personal mobile number has also been mentioned in the post with appeals to share and harass her by making phone calls.The Congress leader said that an FIR in this connection has been lodged with the Cyber Crime Cell of Hazratganj kotwali police station.“The statement issued on my behalf is a total lie and misleading,” she said, adding that it was aimed at branding her anti-Hindu and incite people against her.The Congress leader also charged the BJP with targeting its political opponents after being defeated in some of the recent elections.She alleged that before the 2017 Assembly polls in UP, the BJP would spread communal frenzy for political mileage.Chairman of National Scheduled Caste Commission, P.L. Punia, termed the incident as very serious.“There is a move to damage the image of Congress along with that of Ms Joshi through this false propaganda,” Mr Punia said. -- PTI
