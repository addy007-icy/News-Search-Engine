Terming the event as a mere “gimmick”, BJP on Tuesday slammed the SP government for holding the ‘Pravasi Diwas’, saying the ruling party should first “improve its image” on the law and order front and then invite NRIs to the State.“In reality the law and order situation is such that no industrialist is ready to invest in U.P. First the government should improve its image on this front,” BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Patahk said.He said that while the government was speaking of entering into new ventures with private investors, it should tell the public what happened to the agreements signed earlier.“The people should be told as to how the MoUs signed earlier have benefitted them (people),” he said.Mr Pathak said the government should first improve the basic infrastructure.“There is no denial that there is immense possibility of investment in U.P., but the government has failed in developing infrastructure,” he said. The three-day ‘Uttar Pradesh Pravasi Diwas’ began in Agra on Monday where several non-resident Indians (NRIs) have gathered to celebrate their roots. -- PTI
