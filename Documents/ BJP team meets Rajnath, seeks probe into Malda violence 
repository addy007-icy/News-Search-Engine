Stepping up its attack on the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal over Malda violence, a BJP delegation met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and demanded a high-level probe into the matter, alleging it had links with fake currency and narcotics trade and infiltration.The Home Ministry is likely to send a team to West Bengal to probe the matter.Accusing the Trinamool government of protecting criminals involved in the incident of “anarchy and terror,” a three-member team led by general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who is also its Bengal in-charge, met Mr. Singh, who “assured” them of appropriate action.“Leaders linked with TMC were also involved in it. It is not only a matter of a State but that of national security. People who do illegal activities there were leading it,” Mr. Vijayvargiya said after the meeting.He alleged that “pro-Pakistan” slogans were raised by the crowd which also targeted establishments of a particular community.In a memorandum submitted to the Home Minister, the delegation said “BJP demands that keeping in mind the region’s sensitivity, the West Bengal Chief Minister’s allegation against a paramilitary force, infiltration and trade of narcotics and fake currency through it, an impartial action should be taken.
