: After two departments of the Delhi government and the Traffic Police sought time for compliance with its earlier directions, the Delhi High Court has asked concerned agencies to file reports on the issues identified by it relating to the construction of a three-lane flyover at Rao Tula Ram Marg on Outer Ring Road.The issues included decongestion of traffic in the area, said a Division Bench of the court over the week-end, while making the National Highways Authority of India a party in the matter.The court was informed that an alternative road connecting the traffic coming from Mahipalpur, on NH-8, towards RTR had been made functional.The Bench, comprising Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, was hearing a writ petition moved by the residents’ welfare associations of Vasant Vihar challenging the Public Works Department’s decision to build a three-lane flyover parallel to the existing single-lane flyover on RTR Marg.The court sought a report from the Forest Department on the compliance with its previous order to carry out compensatory plantation before cutting down of trees for the project. The PWD was directed to submit a report giving reasons for suspension of work on the construction of an underpass connecting two roads in the vicinity.The underpass was to be constructed along with the flyover project in order to provide an alternative route from Outer Ring Road to cross the Ring Road, thereby reducing the pressure of traffic on other roads connecting RTR Marg with Ring Road.The Delhi Development Authority informed the court that the road connecting the traffic coming from Mahipalpur towards RTR had become functional. On this, the Bench posed a question about the volume of traffic carried by the road and asked the traffic police to submit a status report on this.The court also suggested that closed circuit television cameras be installed on the road to monitor the flow of vehicles and posted the case for further hearing on February 17.The newly-appointed counsel for Forest Department, PWD and traffic police said the three authorities needed some time to sit together and chalk out a plan to ensure compliance with the court's earlier orders on the petition.The petitioner associations have sought directions for construction of a six-lane flyover at the same location by demolishing the existing one. On the other hand, PWD plans to construct a three-lane flyover from Munirka to Signals Enclave, which will run parallel to the RTR Marg flyover.The High Court also suggested that closed circuit television cameras be installed on the road
