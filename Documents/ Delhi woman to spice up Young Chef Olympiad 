Delhiites are more aware than ever about various types of cuisines, with city restaurants offering a wide variety at various price points, and the Internet and television food shows ensuring there is no dearth of knowledge. In this scenario, training to be a chef can be both challenging and exciting since there are numerous opportunities and restaurants are increasingly being set up and run with a chef as the face of the restaurant.To expose students to the latest trends from across the world, the International Institute of Hotel Management (IIHM) and the Union Ministry of Tourism is organising a Young Chef Olympiad (YCO), where 50 student chefs from 50 countries will take part in a cook-off on Tuesday at Talkatora Indoor Stadium.YCO chairman Suborno Bose said event will be spread across six days and four cities, and the participating students will contest for a grand title and a cash prize of $10,000. The jury from around the world will travel along with the teams to crown the winner. Judges include chef Eric Neo, the president of the Singapore Chef Association and executive chef at Intercontinental Singapore; celebrity chef Kunal Kapur and celebrity food critic Karen Anand.Twenty-one-year-old Nisha Kumari, who will represent India, said nothing makes her happier than picking up a recipe, getting the ingredients together, and enjoying the results.Speaking about what she will teach the participating chefs about Indian cuisine, Nisha said: “Indian food is so vast in itself that it has endless ingredients to play with. But the one thing that I would want them to learn is authenticity. Every region here in India is so incredibly vast that one feels lost thanks to the sheer variety.”
