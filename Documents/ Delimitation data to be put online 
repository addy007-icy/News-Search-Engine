: Public consultations for the delimitation of municipal wards will begin soon, with the Delhi State Election Commission (DSEC) about to publish the preliminary details of the process this month.Information regarding the population growth as per the Census data from 2001 and 2011, and the basic principles laid out for the delimitation exercise will be put online within a week, State Election Commissioner Rakesh Mehta said on Tuesday.The principles are that the average population of each ward will be 60,000, with a variation of 10 to 15 per cent.The boundary of a ward will be within the boundary of the Assembly constituency it is in.The boundary will be clearly defined so that there is no confusion later on.A colony or slum cluster will be kept in the same ward so there is no division; and geospatial maps and Census data will form the primary resource for the delimitation.Delhi saw its population jump from 1.38 crore in 2001 to 1.68 crore in 2011, which means that the organisation of municipal wards may change before the 2017 polls.In the second phase, the draft delimitation order will be put online by May 15, and suggestions and objections would be invited till June 15.
