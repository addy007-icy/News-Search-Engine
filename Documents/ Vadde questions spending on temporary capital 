Former Minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao has demanded that the government construct the actual capital city Amaravati instead of spending crores on temporary Capital.At a media conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Rao said the government had chalked out plans to construct the capital by spending more than Rs. 180 crore. Instead, it could construct the capital city at the identified three riverfront villages.Why does the government want spend public money on temporary capital? Except benefiting the contractors, it would not serve the purpose, he said.Referring to the land acquired under the Land Pooling System (LPS) for the capital, the former Minister said the government should allow farmers to till their lands until the constructions came up there as it would help ensure food security.
