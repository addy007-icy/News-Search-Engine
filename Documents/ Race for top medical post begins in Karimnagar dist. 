The members of Telangana State Government Doctors Association are in disagreement with regard to the appointment of District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO) post in Karimnagar district.The association’s district president and District TB Control Officer Rajesham is in the race for the post, which would fall vacant following the retirement of DMHO Aleem on January 31.Similarly, the deputy DM&HO Vasanth Rao, who had earlier made vain attempts to occupy the coveted post, is now again competing to secure the post. Supporting the candidature of Dr Vasanth Rao, the district association’s joint secretary Vasanth Naik, vice president Suman Mohan Rao and others expressed their solidarity and demanded that the government appoint only Vasanth Rao as DM&HO.At a press conference here on Tuesday, Vasanth Naik and Suman Manohar Rao have said that Dr Vasanth Rao had worked in the PHCs and encouraged institutional deliveries and he would have perfect idea about the administration of district medical and health department. They claimed that Vasantha Rao was eligible for the post as he was having experience and qualifications unlike Dr Rajesham.They also said that association’s central office had also requested the State government for appointing Dr Vasanth Rao for the DM&HO post.
