The two accused had business and financial dealings with the slain engineer, the SP said.The 42-year-old engineer’s murder, coming close on the heels of a similar incident in Darbhanga district in which two engineers of a private road construction company were killed, had raised serious question about law and order situation in Bihar.The Chief Minister had chided the police brass and asked them to take whatever action was required to improve the situation on law and order front. -- PTI
