The date of king Pareekshit’s death became known to him, and he wanted to spend the remaining seven days of his life listening to the Bhagavata Purana, which Sage Suka narrated to him. When Suka was about to begin his narration, the celestials appeared before him and offered him nectar. They said that he could give Pareekshit the nectar instead of narrating Srimad Bhagavatam to him. But the sage said that nothing could liberate a person from the cycle of births and deaths, as the Bhagavata Purana could.The greatness of the Bhagavata Purana was revealed by Brahma also, elaborated P.T. Seshadri in a discourse.Brahma put all the Vedas and all the sacred texts on one side of a balance. On the other, he placed the Bhagavata Purana. The side with the Bhagavata Purana tilted downwards, indicating that all the sacred texts put together could not equal it in greatness.Every yuga has its own dharma, its own way for people to attain liberation. The ways to liberation in each yuga take into account the character of the people who live in the respective yugas. Thus in the Krita yuga, dhyana (meditation) was the prescribed mode; in Treta yuga, yaga (sacrifice) was prescribed; for the dvapara yuga, archana was prescribed; for Kali yuga it is sankeerthanam, the recitation of the Supreme One’s names, that is prescribed.Kali is a time of turmoil and the people of this yuga will not resort to difficult means to attain liberation. Keeping this in mind, a simple method of seeking moksha has been prescribed for them, namely Sankeerthana. The Bhagavata Purana shows us the auspicious qualities of the Lord, and as we chant His name and listen to the Purana, we are freed from worldly pulls and eventually reach His feet.
