Demanding complete ban on mining in ecologically rich Khandadhar hill range, the Khandadhar Surakhya Sangram Samiti and Lok Skakti Abhiyan is planning a huge rally near the Khandadhar waterfall in Odihsa’s Sundargarh district from January 26 to 28.Abhiyan president Prafulla Samantara on Tuesday announced to observe a three-day-long fasting as a mark of support to the demand for mining ban. He said activists like Medha Patkar and Dayanidhi Barla of Jharkhand would join the rally.“There should be complete ban on mining in 25-km radius of Khandadhar Waterfalls which feed water to the Brahmani River and maintain environmental balance in the tribal region,” Mr. Samantra said.“As the State government is keen to lease out iron ore mine to POSCO and the Central government is ready to allocate iron ore reserve through auction, the ecologically-rich Khandadhar hill range faces an imminent threat,” he said.The mining will not only destroy the rich natural resources like water and forest but also adversely affect livelihood of tribals, the activist said.
