The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has maintained that it will reassess the construction sites challaned by the State government on Wednesday, besides taking necessary measures to bring the dust levels down in these areas.At the same time, the DMRC also explained that it carries out air monitoring in three stages — prior to the start of construction, during construction to monitor the impact and during the operations stage.“Construction activities are carried out in accordance with DMRC’s Environmental Policy. Only Pollution Under Control (PUC) certified vehicles are allowed inside the DMRC premises and regular checking is carried out to ensure the validation of the certificate. Water is also sprinkled not only on the ground, but also on the tyres of trucks to reduce dust,” the official added.Under the policy, all waste is segregated before disposal. To prevent land and water contamination, hazardous liquid wastes such as used oil and chemicals are disposed of only through government-approved recyclers of such waste. Water is sprinkled regularly to avoid soil erosion and wheels of trucks are entering the sites are washed.In addition, grass paving and tree plantation are quick and effective means of dust control for disturbed areas, the DMRC said in a statement issued soon after 14 of its construction sites were challaned for exceeding the permissible dust levels as prescribed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).The 15-point dust pollution guidelines of the DPCC include checking whether any construction materials or debris are stored or dumped on roads, or whether the construction area has protective scaffolding around it.Officials say water is sprinkled on the ground and truck tyres to control dust
