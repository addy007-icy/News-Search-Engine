East Delhi residents have the worst lung function compared to the rest of the city, as per the lung function test being conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), which has been rolled out alongside the Delhi government’s ambitious odd-even plan for curbing rising air pollution levels in the city.A comparatively better lung function was found among South Delhi residents.“Of 188 people tested on Monday across 20 centres, 64 showed impaired lung function. Though it is very early to state with total authority that East Delhi residents have the worst lung function, we are seeing a consistent trend over the past few days. We will, however, do a final analysis, after which we will be able to provide the exact extend of the problem,” said project head and MAMC professor of community medicine Suneela Garg.“The tests have shown that there is definitely a problem and that there is an urgent need to bring in a robust public health policy to curb the problem.”Though a comprehensive report is yet to be compiled, MAMC also found that one of every four persons who took the tests over the past few days had ‘compromised’ lung function.“Most of the people we tested across the city had either obstructive or restrictive lung function. We hope these people will follow up their case with pulmonologists. We have also recommended that when patients come in for a routine check-up, a lung function test should also be carried out to ensure that they are warned about any impending health problems,” explained Dr. Garg.Of 188 people tested on Monday, 64 showed impaired lung function
