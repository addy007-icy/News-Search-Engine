Though second only to the Revenue Department in contributions to the exchequer, the Motor Vehicles Department is beset with infrastructure shortcomings, which is best manifested in the Ernakulam Regional Transport Office. The office in the past year generated Rs.3.66 crore, clocking an average of over Rs.30 lakh a month, but not a single penny was spent on the woeful infrastructure.Sources said that the workload of the office warrants around 20 Motor Vehicle Inspectors (MVIs) and 50 Assistant Motor Vehicle Inspectors (AMVIs) instead of which there are just 7 and 19 respectively. Three MVIs and six AMVIs are assigned with the mobile enforcement squads every day leaving out just four MVIs and 13 AMVIs to deal with the bulk of work including fitness, registration, driving licence test, taxation, accident inspection, mobile court duty, etc.Two AMVIs preside over the fitness test of an average 120 vehicles a day while another two handle the registration of around 200 vehicles daily. There have been days when an AMVI had to cope with the technical inspection in 30-50 accidents.MVIs and AMVIs have to sit cheek by jowl as just two rooms have been allotted to them. “Often we have to ask people to move out and bolt the door to change uniform,” an official lamented. Though Smart Move, the automation of RT offices was implemented in 2003, files dating back years still remain piled up in offices. Even the computers allocated for works are of archaic configuration and get hung up when the traffic picks up. “There have been times when the department couldn’t even take action on traffic violations captured by surveillance cameras for want of paper and stamp to sent notices to the parties concerned,” sources said. Out of the seven vehicles in the disposal of the Ernakulam RTO, two have fallen into disrepair and three are deployed for mobile enforcement leaving just two vehicles for the movement of officials.The lot of the public approaching the office has been no better either as even basic facilities like chairs and drinking water is missing.
