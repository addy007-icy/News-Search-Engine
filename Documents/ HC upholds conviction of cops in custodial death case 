The Delhi High Court has upheld the conviction and 10 year sentence handed out to two Delhi Police officers involved in a custodial death case that dates back to August 22, 1986.A trial court had held three police officers — then Sub-Inspector Satish Kumar Kadian, then Divisional Officer Sub-Inspector Inder Singh Rana and Constable Ramesh Chand — guilty of beating to death Gopi Ram of Patel Nagar under Section 304-I (culpable homicide not amounting to murder, if act by which the death is caused is done with intention to cause death) of the Indian Penal Code and awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment to each of them.The High Court, however, acquitted Ramesh Chand saying “Ramesh is entitled to an acquittal. He is accordingly acquitted of the charges leveled against him”.The three police personnel were then posted at the Patel Nagar police station. The proceedings against another constable at the police station, who was also involved in the case, were abated as he passed away during the trial.According to the prosecution, the four police officers picked up Sudesh Kumar while he was sleeping at his residence and started beating him. Hearing his cries, his maternal uncle Gopi Ram (the deceased) came out and was assaulted by the policemen.Later, both Kumar and Ram were taken to the police station where they were assaulted with an iron bar and lathi. Gopi Ram was declared dead at a private nursing home, where he was taken after he lost consciousness.
