The PWD in the last couple of weeks has been reducing the release of water from the dam in a phased manner with the crop season nearing completion in the delta region.“The water release has been brought down to bare minimum as the farm season has almost come to an end and there is no need for water further in delta districts,” PWD sources told The Hindu, adding that the shutters of the dam are expected to be closed shortly.Water release from the dam began on August 9 last year after a delay of almost about two months for launching farm activities on 12 lakh acres in the Cauvery delta districts.The crop season is nearing completion in the delta region
