The Centre has asked the state governments to hold bi-monthly meetings with exporters, especially to address infrastructure and tax-related issues.Inputs received from the states would be then considered by the Centre, on a dynamic basis, for taking further steps to reduce the transaction costs of exporters and in turn boost the competitiveness of India’s exports.This was one of the main takeaways from the first meeting of the Council for Trade Development and Promotion on Friday, which was chaired by Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Though the trade and commerce ministers of all the states were invited, only ten of them turned up. The remaining states were represented by the concerned secretaries or the resident commissioners. “I wish there were more trade and commerce) ministers from states,” Ms. Sitharaman said.The Centre has been trying to push a ‘competitive and cooperative federalism’ model to encourage states to take measures to improve the ease of doing business, thereby attracting more investment, generating greater employment and boosting exports as well. Ministers from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal could not attend as they were busy with the investment summits being held in those states. The concerned minister from Bihar was also engaged with meetings regarding the investment conference in West Bengal, Ms. Sitharaman said.Suggestions by StatesThe states, on their part, wanted the Centre to take care of all the infrastructure-related issues including at ports, special economic zones and inland container depots (ICD). The land-locked states sought 1-2 per cent subsidy to exporters to compensate higher logistics costs.Exporters’ body FIEO said that delays in refund of state levies was hurting the liquidity position of small exporters, adding that states should ensure to put in place a mechanism for timely clearance of such dues. Pointing out that in India, roads carry nearly 65 per cent cargo against the global trend where railway is the major contributor, FIEO said, therefore, states should focus on improving the last mile connectivity of major exporting hubs to ICDs/ports.The meeting was attended among others by representatives from industry bodies, other central government ministries such as civil aviation and finance and commerce and industry.Maharashtra leading exporterMaharashtra with Rs.4,45,350 crore and Gujarat (Rs.3,64,316 crore) were the leading states in exports in 2014-15.
