How can the police initiate a mere departmental inquiry when a robbery is alleged to have been committed on the instruction of a constable? Justice A.V. Chandrashekara of the Karnataka High Court posed this question to the police during the hearing of a petition filed by Sesha alias Seshadri, who is in judicial custody in a dacoity case, seeking release on bail“It is unfortunate that only a departmental enquiry was initiated against the police constable and no criminal action is initiated against him” even though the documents submitted before the trial court clearly disclose that the constable and his brother were hand-in-glove with the suspects, the court observed.While perusing records of the case, the court found that following his arrest by Madanayakanahalli police in September 2015, Sesha had given a statement that he and his associate had robbed a lonely woman on the instructions of constable Krishnamurthy, who is attached to Madanayakanahalli police station.In a confession, submitted to the jurisdictional magistrate in October last year, he claimed that he and his accomplice, Goutam, had met Krishnamurthy and his brother Jayaram after committing the dacoity.“Krishnamurthy and Jayaram showed the house, in which a lady was living alone and told the accused to assault her with a chopper and snatch her gold chain. A sum of Rs. 5,000 was obtained by the accused Sesha from Krishnamurthy and Jayaram,” the HC noticed in Sesha’s statement. Also, Sesha had told the police that he had called Krishnamurthy on his mobile phone after looting Rs. 35,000 and six mobile phones from a group of persons in Bailakonahalli and “Krishnamurthy had told him not to use looted mobile phones at any cost”.On the court’s query of involvement of a constable, the government counsel said that a departmental inquiry was initiated and Krishnamurthy was suspended. However, the suspension was revoked and he was transferred to Sulibele police station pending enquiry. Pointing out that such instances would bring disrepute to the entire department if no immediate action was taken, the court hoped that the Police Department would act swiftly against the constable.A lonely woman was targeted allegedly on the instructions ofa constable
