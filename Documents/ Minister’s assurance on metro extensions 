Every effort will be made to extend the Kochi metro up to Pettah, while Tripunithura and Kakkanad extensions will follow suit, Minister for Power and Railway Aryadan Mohammed said, at a function in Muttom coach depot on Saturday to flag off the first train’s test run.He added that the project could save approximately Rs 500 crore due to prompt completion of works and tender conditions. Anwar Sadath, MLA, sought extension of the metro to Angamaly through international airport, a passenger-dense corridor.S. Sarma, MLA, wondered why there is undue delay in taking the metro to Pettah and Tripunithura. “The Rs. 5,182 crore project could have been completed for Rs. 2,250 crore if the then UPA government had granted sanction to the then LDF government about a decade ago,” he said.The global President of Alstom Transport Henri Poupart-Lafarge said that the Kochi metro coaches having life span of 35 years are the first the company is making fully in India.
