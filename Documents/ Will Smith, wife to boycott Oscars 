Will Smith says he will not attend the Academy Awards next month, joining his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and others in protest against two straight years of all-white acting nominees.Smith said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he and Pinkett Smith have discussed it and feel “we’re uncomfortable to stand there and say this is OK.”Some thought Smith might be nominated for his performance in the football drama “Concussion,” but he was not. Smith would likely have been a sought-after presenter at the Feb. 28 ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.
