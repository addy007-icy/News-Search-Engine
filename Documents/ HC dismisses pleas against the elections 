The Principal Bench of the Karnataka High Court on Monday dismissed all petitions, which had challenged laws and methodology related to reserving seats for various castes in taluk and zilla panchayats, and thus cleared the way for the State Election Commission (SEC) to hold elections to these panchayats in several districts. Justice S. Abdul Nazeer passed the order on the petitions related to zilla panchayats of Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Shivamogga, Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, Mysuru and other districts, which come under the jurisdiction of High Court’s Principal Bench for adjudication of writ petitions.Meanwhile, the Kalaburagi Bench of the High Court, which had stayed the elections to ZPs of Kalaburagi, Bidar and two other districts, will be hearing the petitions on Tuesday as the SEC had sought vacating of the interim order.— Special Correspondent
