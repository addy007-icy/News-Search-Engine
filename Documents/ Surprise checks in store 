To reduce the likelihood of clogging during the odd-even exercise, the Delhi Traffic Police aims to conduct surprise checks.Speaking about the deployment plan, officers said that 10-member teams will be out on the roads during peak hours.“These teams will move within their traffic circle and conduct surprise checks,” said a senior police officer. These teams would be led by a sub-inspector rank officer.Traffic inspectors of different districts will be on the move with one Inspector monitoring three or four spots.Another senior officer said that most of his men, he himself being one, would be on duty till 3 a.m. but would report back for work five hours later. Those with prosecuting powers, other than the police, such as the sub-divisional magistrates or Transport Department personnel would carry out prosecutions independently of the Delhi Police.It is not certain whether there would be overlapping of prosecution points in that case, but officials have been requested to inform the Traffic Police once they issue a challan.
