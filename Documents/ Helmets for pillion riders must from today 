Do pillion riders have to wear a helmet from Tuesday? While the Transport Department says yes, the City Traffic Police insist that there is more time.The rule making helmets mandatory for pillion riders too comes into force from Tuesday, but the Traffic Police won’t crack down on violators till January 20.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M.A. Saleem told The Hindu that they want every motorist to be aware of the rule. “Now, it is time for education. After January 20, we will start implementing the rule and penalise violators,” he explained. All pillion riders will be expected to wear ISI certified helmets, failing which, they will be fined Rs. 100 the first time.But Transport Department officials said it had been communicated clearly that the rule will come into force on January 12. Transport Commissioner Ramegowda said that 15 days’ time had already been given to the public to comply. However, there is not much that the Transport Department can do. “As per the rules, police are the enforcement agency,” he explained.Sources in the government admitted to a delay in implementing the rule, but officials expect the police to go easy for the first few days. “The directions from the Supreme Court came in March. We got six reminders after that. Non-implementation will be treated as contempt of court. But the police are the implementing authorities,” a source said.
