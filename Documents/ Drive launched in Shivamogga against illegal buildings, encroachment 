The Shivamogga City Corporation on Tuesday launched a drive against buildings constructed in violation of norms related to parking space.A multi-storied building under construction at Durgigudi locality here had not reserved any space for setback and parking slot. The building owner had constructed stalls in the setback space and parking slot. The city corporation officials demolished a portion of the structure that had come up in the space meant for setback and parking purposes.When the city corporation officials began razing an illegal structure on Balaraj Urs Road, the building owner requested for some time to make alterations in accordance with the norms related to parking and setback space. Shops that had come up in parking and setback space in that building were immediately evacuated. The building owner promised to the officials that he would demolish the structure that had been raised in parking and setback spaces.In another case, a man had encroached upon a site allotted by the city corporation to a beneficiary of a housing scheme at Chikkal locality and had constructed a shed there with bricks and tin sheets. The encroachment was cleared and the shed demolished.Commissioner A.R. Ravi told presspersons here that notices had been issued to the owners of around 50 buildings, which had violated the law.Buildings constructed without reserving space for parking of vehicles had compounded the problem of traffic jam in the city limits as the vehicles were being parked in a haphazard manner on roadsides. The city corporation would initiate stern action against the owners of such buildings, he said.
