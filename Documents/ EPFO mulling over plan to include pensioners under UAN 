The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is considering a proposal to bring in pensioners covered by the EPFO under the Universal Account Number (UAN) network to avoid duplicity, according to Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Maruti Bhoyi.Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, he said that a final decision had not been taken. Mr. Bhoyi said that it was now compulsory for every member to have the UAN for filing claim forms or to have any correspondence about their account with the EPFO. He said that the employees who did not have UAN should approach their employer or the nearest PF office to get it.Mr. Bhoyi said that 73 per cent of members had been provided UAN in the Kalaburagi Regional Office covering 14 districts of north Karnataka. Steps were being initiated to bring remaining under the UAN network.Mr. Bhoyi said that the EPFO had simplified the procedure for claims and members whose Know Your Customer details like Aadhaar number and bank account number had been seeded to their UAN could submit their claims form directly to the Commissioner without the attestation of the employers.To another question, Mr. Bhoyi said that the process to issue digital life certificate had been completed in the third week of December and pensioners had been covered under it. There was a proposal to install biometric and IRIS machines in banks to help pensioners renew their digital life certificates every year.
