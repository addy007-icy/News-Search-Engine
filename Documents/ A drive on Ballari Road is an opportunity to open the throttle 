Cases of speeding to and from Nandi Hills is a familiar story for traffic cops monitoring Ballari Road.The number of accidents is particularly high in the early morning hours and during weekends, they say.While 55 deaths were recorded in 2014, the number was 42 in 2015. Besides this, more than 300 motorists were injured in accidents on the stretch in 2015.Though the speed limit on the highway is 80 kmph, the average speed on this stretch at night and the early morning hours is above 100 kmph.Police suspect that the sedan involved in Monday’s accident must have been travelling at around 120 kmph.“Nandi Hills has, in fact, attained a cult following not just for its scenic beauty but also for the high speed drive it offers. Youths who have a craze for speeding choose certain roads that provide such opportunities. The route to Nandi Hills is one such stretch,” a senior traffic cop said.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) M.A. Saleem said that they deploy speed guns at Devanahalli, Venkatala and other strategic points on weekends.“After deploying these interceptors, accidents during weekends have reduced. But to circumvent this, youths have started going during the wee hours of weekdays. We will henceforth deploy interceptors in the early morning hours on weekdays too,” he said.More than 300 motorists were injured in accidents on the stretchin 2015
