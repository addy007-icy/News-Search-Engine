At a time when pesticide residue in agricultural products has become a cause for concern and there is a growing need to bridge the gap between demand and supply of vegetables, the Horticulture Department has decided to conduct a mega campaign in Chennai on January 23 and 24 to promote vegetable cultivation on rooftops.The objective of this “do it yourself” programme is to motivate urban dwellers to grow poison-free and eco-friendly vegetables in an effort that can be sustained throughout the year.In Chennai, the campaign will be held in 100 centres, including Corporation parks and schools, in coordination with the Chennai Corporation.The department has plans to distribute between 15,000 and 20,000 ‘Do it yourself kits’ at a cost of Rs. 500 each.Chief Minister Jayalalithaa launched the scheme in 2013 and it proved successful in Chennai and Coimbatore.It was subsequently extended to Tiruchi and Madurai at a cost of Rs 5.37 crore, in 2015. A senior official of the department said the scheme would ensure nutritional security through fresh green vegetables. He said demand for vegetable was fuelled by various factors, which include urbanisation, increase in per capita consumption and health consciousness.In the urban setting, the desire to take up gardening and nurture plants is often not realised as space is hard to come by. When it comes to cultivation of vegetables, Tamil Nadu stands first, covering 2.76 lakh hectares. The production is 29.95 tonne per hectare at the national level.
