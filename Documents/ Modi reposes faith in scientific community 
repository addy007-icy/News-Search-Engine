Prime Minister Mr.Narendra Modi set the tone for the 103rd Indian Science Congress which commenced in Mysuru on Sunday by reposing country’s faith in science and in its scientists and said that confidence of future of India is because of its faith in the scientific community.Delivering the inaugural address of the flagship event, Mr.Modi said India had made giant strides in science and said that India’s success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space and the country was once again turning towards scientists and innovators to realize the goals of economic welfare and development of 1.2 billion people and address problems plaguing India. India was witness to another revolution in the present times, one of empowerment and opportunities in India. “”We are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development’’, said Mr.Modi.The 33 minute speech of the Prime Minister touched upon the entire gamut of the major plenary sessions and themes listed for discussions in the Indian Science Congress ranging from agriculture and forestry sciences to biotechnology and marine sciences, space, urbanisation, Mr.Modi stressed on urbanisation and environment and said the world was on the cusp of entering an urban era with more than 2/3rd of the world population living in the cities while 50 per cent of India’s population would live in urban areas by 2050.Besides, by 2025, 10 per cent of the global urban population would be in India where more than 40 per cent of them live in slums devoid of humane living conditions and deprived of access to quality life.
