As part of its social outreach project, Anbin Oli, the Jerusalem Mar Thoma Church at Anna Nagar, has adopted Naduvankarai slum, which is found on the banks of the Cooum River, between Shanthi Colony and Poonamallee High Road. Around 30 members of the church are involved in the project.Ipe Job, convenor, Anpin Oli, said, “More than 100 families with a population of around 500 live here. Many youngsters are unemployed, households lack drinking water and face the problems of poor sanitation.”To address the issues, the members of the church have a plan of action. “In the first phase, we initiated centralised centres for teaching the slum children ,” said Job.Tuitions for primary classes are conducted from 5 to 6.30 p.m. in all the subjects. “In the coming days, we will be conducting tuition classes for other classes on a shift basis. We need more volunteers for the project,” he said.The other activities include identifying unemployed youth, providing skill development training, conducting spoken English classes, forming women self-help groups, creating a network with the banks and offering counselling programmes.Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan Yojana, it plans to collaborate with the Chennai Corporation and Central agencies to construct toilets.Recently, the church distributed sanitation kits to children and household utensils to 100 families.For details, contact Ipe Job at 9566116031.
