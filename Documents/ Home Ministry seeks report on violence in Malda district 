The Union Home Ministry has sought a report from the West Bengal government on the violence at Kaliachak in Malda district earlier this week.The development comes three days after the violence at Kaliachak triggered communal tension in the area.On Wednesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership raised the pitch over the issue. BJP MLA Samik Lahiri, who tried to enter Kaliachak earlier in the day with a party delegation, was arrested and released later in the day.A delegation of the party leadership, led by former State president and national secretary Rahul Sinha, met Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi over the issue.Speaking to journalists, Mr. Sinha said that the Governor had assured the delegation that he would inform the Centre about the developments at Malda.While 10 persons have been arrested in connection with the violence in which a mob ransacked the local police station, the BJP leadership claimed that the action was “too little and too late”.The BJP leadership alleged that the attack on Kaliachak police station on Sunday was an act of “anti-national elements” who had been operating in the area for quite some time. It is also learnt that the BJP, which will hold a political rally at Malda later this month, will highlight the issue.Sources within the BJP said like the accidental blasts at Khargragarh in the State’s Burdwan district, which revealed a web of anti-national elements operating the State, the violence at Malda may have an insidious agenda and it was the result of the ruling Trinamool Congress dealing with such elements with “velvet gloves”.
