Syrian troops and allied militiamen on Wednesday expanded their area of control around a major insurgent stronghold in the northwestern province of Latakia, a day after seizing a key rebel-held town in the region, the government and opposition activists said.The insurgents in the opposition-held area known as Jabal al-Akrad were collapsing after the key town of Salma fell to government loyalists late Tuesday. Salma’s fall marked one of the most significant military achievements by the Syrian military since Russia began airstrikes in the country last September to shore up President Bashar Assad’s forces.On Wednesday, government troops seized the villages of Mrouniyah and Marj Kawkah near Salma as they continued their advances in the region, aided by intense Russian airstrikes.Salma, a strategic town in the Latakia mountains that has been under rebel control for the past three years, was captured by army units backed by pro-government militiamen on Tuesday, dealing a severe blow to insurgents.The town had once been predominantly inhabited by members of Assad’s Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.The recapture of Salma is the latest in a string of military achievements by the government recently, supported by Russian air power and Lebanon’s Shiite militant Hezbollah group.Russia began conducting airstrikes in Syria on Sept. 30 against the Islamic State group and “other terrorists,” but much of the Russian airstrikes have targeted areas where the IS has no presence.“Salma has fallen after 93 days of battles and daily barrel bombs and airstrikes,” said Zakariya Ahmad, an opposition activist in the nearby Idlib province. He said activists in the region had reported 92 airstrikes believed to be Russian on Salma in the last 24 hour stretch before it was fully seized by government troops.Jabal al-Akrad is close to the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib, which has also been frequently targeted by Russian warplanes since Moscow launched its air campaign. It is controlled by a consortium of mainstream and extremist insurgent groups including the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham and the Nusra Front.Latakia province includes key strongholds of Assad and the Alawite religious minority.
