Publication of results and student registration for various examinations at the Cochin University of Science and Technology has run into rough weather.Software glitches and ‘server problems’ seem to be delaying the entire exam-related work. Faculty members told The Hindu that the entry of marks into the system has slowed down considerably for more than six months. Examiners are facing difficulty in accessing the programme. It generally takes half an hour to make a single entry, especially during the daytime.They said that the examiners value the papers and then leave for their destinations. The varsity has no other option but to call them again for entering the marks. The financial burden has shot up as the authorities have to pay travel allowance to the faculty members, who come back for entering the marks.Teachers said that the Hyderabad firm, which was entrusted with the work on developing the software for centralised examination-related works, had failed to depute its personnel to update the software with the progress of each semester. The software is being used to process the results, student registration, hall ticket generation and valuation work.Faculty members said that students were not able to register online. The situation has turned worse for those candidates, who had shifted to other colleges by opting the transfer option or in cases of re-admission, as they have to run from pillar to post to register for the examinations. A.B. Bhasi, Controller of Examinations, said that the delay in updating the software had slowed down the examination-related works.The software firm does not have its personnel here to carry out urgent work and they have to come all the way from Hyderabad. After repeated requests, they have now turned up on the campus and we are resolving the issues.
