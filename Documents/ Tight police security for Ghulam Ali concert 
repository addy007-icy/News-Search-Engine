: The City police provided tight security to celebrated Ghazal maestro Ghulam Ali during his live concert at Swapna Nagari on Sunday. A protest march taken out by the Shiv Sena workers made no impact as it was blocked several metres away from the programme venue.No fewer than 75 Shiv Sena workers who took part in the march were removed from the spot. Initially, there were around 100 persons, but, some of them escaped from the spot following the police action.Around 600 police personnel, in addition to those from the Armed reserve camp, had been posted at the venue to ensure the proper screening of all those who entered the compound to watch the concert.Assistant Commissioners from the city took the responsibility of coordinating their teams. Deputy Police Superintendents from neighbouring districts too offered their support to tighten the security arrangements.Shiv Sena leaders who took out the protest march claimed that they were not against Ghulam Ali’s performance in the city. “The protest was organised as per the national-level decision of the party that Indians should not cooperate with Pakistan in any sort of activity in the wake of its proxy war against the country,” they said.
