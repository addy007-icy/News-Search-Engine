A year after an unsuccessful attempt at digitising what is termed a time-consuming process in the counselling for admissions to professional courses, the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) is reviving efforts to bring the document verification process online. The counselling process will follow the Common Entrance Test (CET), which will be held on May 4 and 5.Officials from the KEA met those from the Survey Settlement and Land Records Department on Tuesday to discuss about the possibility of introducing the online verification as income, caste and other certificates are issued by them. Close to 1.5 lakh students write the CET each year, of which around 80,000 qualify.Survey Settlement and Land Records Department officials said that with all the certificates going paperless since two months, the Department would be able to give access to the KEA to the unique IDs of the students who apply under reservation categories.Before last year’s CET, there were thoughts about bringing the process online, as the application process was already made online, but the proposal was subsequently put off. Currently, students are divided into groups based on ranking and categories, including sports, NCC and physical disabilities. The overall process takes over 15 days with students having to go to ‘helpline centres’ and waiting for their turn. The issue has been ensuring the authenticity of documents, especially as the main aspects to the verification process would be determining whether the students qualify under the rural category, if they belong to Kannada medium and their caste/category.The process takes over 15 days with students having to go to ‘helpline centres’
