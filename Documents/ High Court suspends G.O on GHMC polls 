A division bench of the High Court in Hyderabad comprising Acting Chief Justice D.B. Bhosale and Justice S.V. Bhatt on Thursday suspended the operation of the Telangana State GO that sought to reduce the time schedule for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections.The bench said the elections would be held as per rules in force, prior to the GO’s issuance and indicated the time table.The bench was dealing with two cases filed separately by M. Sashidhar Reddy, senior Congress leader, and Raghunatha Rao, a resident of Hyderabad.Mr. Reddy’s counsel Jandhyala Ravishankar wanted the State Election Commission (SEC) and the Government to stick to the schedule of 40 days as stated before the court in an earlier case.Mr. Rao challenged the January 4 GO which the Government used to bring an amendment to section 33 of the GHMC Act.The time for filing nominations after election notification for withdrawals was reduced. Senior counsel D.V. Seetha Rama Murthy said the Telangana Government could not amend an Act through a GO and said it was unconstitutional.K. Rama Krishna Reddy, Advocate General of Telangana, contended that the Reorganisation Act gave the Government power to amend the Act through Executive orders. The bench pointed out that a GO was already issued adapting the GHMC Act to Telangana State and if a new amendment was to be made, it could be done through an ordinance or an Act by the Legislature.The bench felt that prima facie the reduction in time schedule may not be correct.After hearing the arguments for nearly 45 minutes before lunch, the bench adjourned the matter to 2.15 p.m. to facilitate the Advocate General to inform the court when the final notification for reservation of wards was likely. Post-lunch, the bench heard all the advocates and passed orders.The bench pointed out that everyone wanted elections to the GHMC and said the Government and SEC would have to stick to a rational time table.The court, speaking through the Acting Chief Justice, directed the State Government to issue the notification finalising the reservation of wards for SC, ST, Women and BC categories by Saturday, January 9.The SEC then will issue election notification immediately and conduct elections as per law, without reference to the new GO which is suspended, and complete the process by February second week.The bench said that the issue of competency of the Government to amend the Act through Executive Act will be decided after the Sankranthi vacation in a final hearing.
