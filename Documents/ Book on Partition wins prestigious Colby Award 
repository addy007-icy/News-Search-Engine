Colby Award for 2016, a statement said.Hajari’s first book covers the Partition and the violence that surrounded that event.The prize, named after a former CIA Director, is awarded annually by Norwich University to a first-time author in recognition of a work of fiction or non-fiction that has made a major contribution to the understanding of military history, intelligence operation, or international affairs.“I am absolutely thrilled to be named the recipient of the 2016 Colby Award,” Hajari, a journalist, said. “To join the company of such distinguished military and historical writers as Jon Meacham and Dexter Filkins is a tremendous honour, and it’s particularly gratifying that the judges chose to highlight a subject that may be unfamiliar to many American readers.”The award and honorarium will be presented to Hajari at Norwich University in April.
