A Delhi Police sub-inspector killed his alleged paramour in broad daylight on Sunday before committing suicide himself at a park in Dwarka.The policeman, Vijender Verma (29), and the woman, news stringer Nikita Chauhan (24), reportedly knew each other since four years.According to the police, their relationship had graduated from that of a source and a journalist into a romantic one before taking an ugly turn.Both the deceased were married and allegedly had issues with their spouses.The incident was reported from a park located in a residential area in Sector 4 of Dwarka.Vijender shot Nikita, a resident of Sagarpur, with his service revolver, said a senior police officer.A man named Barrister, who irons clothes next to the park, said the episode unfolded in just 15 minutes.According to him, the animated conversation between Vijender and Nikita was interrupted after the former received a phone call.He took the extreme step after the call ended, Barrister added.“I saw them coming at 11.15 a.m. They sat on a bench and were talking to each other. I was ironing clothes. Around 11.30 a.m. a gunshot drew my attention and in less than a minute the two were lying injured before my eyes,” said Barrister.He added that Vijender stood up to shot the woman, who was seated on the bench.“She collapsed on the bench as the policeman shot himself and fell,” said Barrister.Police said that Vijender shot himself twice after pumping four bullets into Nikita’s body.The police were called in and Nikita was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where she was declared brought dead.Vijender was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where he was admitted in a critical state. He succumbed to his injuries a few hours later.Vijender was posted at the Ranhola police station in West Delhi.Incidentally, Nikita had filed a complaint of harassment against the 2010-batch sub-inspector at the Uttam Nagar police station in October last year. She withdrew the complaint after the police started registering a case, said Deependra Pathak, Joint Commissioner of Police (South-Western Range).Incidentally, Nikita had filed a complaint of harassment against the 2010-batch sub-inspector at the Uttam Nagar police station
