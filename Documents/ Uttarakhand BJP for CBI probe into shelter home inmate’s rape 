Terming the sexual exploitation of a physically challenged inmate of a women’s shelter home here as a “blot on the reputation of Uttarakhand”, opposition BJP on Sunday demanded a CBI probe into the incident alleging that a crime of this kind could not have been committed without the involvement of political bigwigs.The party which has long been demanding a CBI probe into the 2014 incident said its women’s wing will observe an eight-day relay fast from January 23 to 30 to mount pressure on the State government to recommend an inquiry by the apex investigation agency into the “shameful” episode, state BJP co-media in charge Abhimanyu Kumar said.Mr. Kumar said that the BJP Mahila Morcha will stage a march to the Chief Minister’s residence on February 1 to hold a demonstration in protest.The incident is a blot on the reputation of Uttarakhand (also called ‘Devabhoomi’ or land of Gods). Moreover, a brutality of this kind could not have been perpetrated on the hapless victim without either the involvement or protection of political heavyweights to the culprits, he said, adding that a CBI probe alone could bring out the truth.The shocking incident of rape and abortion of a hearing and speech impaired inmate at the women’s shelter home, the lone government-run facility of its kind in the city, had come to light in November 2014 prompting the State government to order a probe into it by an SIT headed by SP (city) Sanjay Singh.Nine persons, mostly shelter home insiders, have been arrested in connection with the incident, including its director and another official after medical examination of the victim confirmed rape and abortion.
