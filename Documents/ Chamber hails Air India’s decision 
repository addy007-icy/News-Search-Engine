The Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has appealed to the Union Civil Aviation Ministry to opt for immediate scrapping of 5/20 rule, which stipulates that airlines in India can fly abroad only when they have five years of domestic flying experience and at least 20 aircraft.In a statement issued here on Monday, the president of the chamber, N. Jegatheesan, and senior president S. Rethinavelu insisted that the government should not implement any new conditions in its place for new domestic airlines for operation in international routes.Welcoming the reversal of stand on 5/20 rule by Air India, the chamber said that the proactive change in policy of the national carrier would provide leverage for the Civil Aviation Ministry to withdraw the impugned rule which restricts Indian cities, especially tier II cities, from getting comprehensive international air connectivity.Lack of direct connectivity to international destinations hampered tourism growth, foreign direct investment and economic progress in tier II cities.The chamber recalled that in March 2015, as an alternative to 5/20 rule, the Civil Aviation Ministry also proposed not to allow domestic airliners to operate in international routes which were of less than six hours’ flight from Indian cities.As the flight time from many Indian cities like Madurai to South Asia and Middle East countries is only about 4 to 5 hours, implementation of the proposal would virtually block operation of flights by new domestic airliners to these destinations, the statement said.“Lack of direct connectivity to international destinations hampered tourism growth”
