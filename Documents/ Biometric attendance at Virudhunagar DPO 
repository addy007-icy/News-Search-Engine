As part of the e-governance initiative, Virudhunagar district police have introduced biometric attendance system for the ministerial staff.Virudhunagar Superintendent of Police P. Aravindhan said that the district police office (DPO) had used an indigenous system for attendance that would be used by 76 ministerial staff.“As of now, the attendance is maintained manually. It consumes a lot of time to consolidate the leave particulars of individuals. But, with the new system, the attendance is automatically stored in the computer within seconds past 10 a.m. every day,” he said.Mr. Aravindhan said that with biometric system, the attendance would be more reliable without any chance for proxy attendance. The staff had to come to office at 10 a.m. and could not leave office before 5.45 p.m. as even the leaving time had to be punched, he said.The new system was confined to ministerial staff because only they worked on fixed timings, while others in the DPO worked in different shifts.
