Senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka who had cancelled the mutation of a land deal between a firm owned by Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and realty major DLF, was among six officers promoted to the rank of Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary by the Haryana government on Friday.Mr. Khemka is currently posted as Secretary and Director-General, Archaeology and Museums Department of the Haryana Government.The other five IAS officers of 1991 batch who have been promoted to the rank of Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary are Abhilaksh Likhi, Vineet Garg, Anil Malik, AK Singh and Shrikant Walgad said a senior official here.“These officers have been promoted to the Higher Administrative Grade (HAG) which entitles them to be designated as Financial Commissioner and Principal Secretary,” Additional Chief Secretary Sanjeev Kaushal said.Mr. Kaushal further said the officers who have been promoted will continue holding the same charge which they are presently handling.In November 2015, the BJP-led Haryana government had dropped charge sheet against Mr. Khemka in which he had been charged by the previous Congress regime with exceeding his jurisdiction when he had cancelled the mutation of a land deal between a firm owned by Mr Vadra and the realty major.Mr. Khemka came into limelight in 2012 when he had cancelled the mutation of land deal between Skylight Hospitality owned by Mr. Vadra and DLF.The Rs 58 -rore deal related to 3.5 acre land in Gurgaon’s Shikohpur village, which was sold by Mr. Vadra to DLF amid controversy over allegations of undervaluation.
