First innings hero Kagiso Rabada struck two early blows as South Africa pushed for victory on the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against England at SuperSport Park on Monday.England, set an unlikely target of 382 on a deteriorating pitch, was 52 for three at the close after South Africa declared its second innings on 248 for five. Rabada, who took seven for 112 in the first innings, dismissed Alex Hales and Nick Compton, while Morne Morkel claimed the wicket of Alastair Cook for the second time in the match.Earlier, after A.B. de Villiers copped his second duck of the match, a stand of 117 between Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma put South Africa in a commanding position.Amla departed for 96 and Bavuma was unbeaten on 78 when the hosts declared.The highest successful chase at Centurion Park yet is 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was used only for two days in that rain-hit match, with the teams deciding to forfeit an innings each to force a result.
