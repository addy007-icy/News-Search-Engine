: Retail ration dealers in the State will close down shops from January 11.Babychen Mukkadan, general secretary of the All India Ration Dealers Association, and A. Shajahar, State secretary, said at a press conference here on Monday that the Essential Services Maintenance Act should be invoked against workers whose protest demanding an increase in stacking charges had disrupted ration distribution.Demanding the intervention of Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in the issue, they said ration stocks were not being lifted from the FCI godowns at Kazhakuttam and Valiathura for the past 13 days following the workersâ€™ strike. As a result, card-holders were not getting ration from retail shops.Wholesale dealers had already struck work from Monday, they said. Wholesale dealers had not agreed to increase the stacking charges without an increase in their commission. The government paid the wholesale dealers Rs.3,700 for transporting a load of ration stock to retail shops. However, since the actual cost incurred was nearly double, the dealers had struck work.The FCI had directed that stacking charges should not be paid to the workers, and there was a High Court order in this regard. Despite these, the workers were disrupting ration distribution in the name of stacking charges, they alleged.
