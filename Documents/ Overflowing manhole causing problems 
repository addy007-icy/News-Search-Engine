A dysfunctional manhole on the Uppidammoodu Bridge-S.L. Theatre stretch is causing inconvenience to road users.The manhole located on the Chettikulangara road regularly overflows with sewage water resulting in waterlogging.A commuter said the stretch was often rendered unmotorable as overflowing sewage stagnated for days.“The capacity of sewer lines in the area has not been changed to cater to the growing population. Earlier, sewage used to overflow only during rainy days, but now it has become a foutine affair in the city. Sewage issues such as blocks and spills have become common in several parts,” said Nanthan, a resident of Uppidammoodu.A senior official attached to the Sewerage Wing of the Kerala Water Authority said instructions had been given to repair the manhole. The KWA had started an assessment of manholes which needs to be replaced.“Most of the existing manholes were constructed during the 1940s and 60s. Some of them were replaced, particularly at Sasthamangalam, Vazhuthacaud and Kowdiar. We are planning to replace all old manholes,” the official added.Most of the manholes in the city were constructed in the 1940s and 60s
