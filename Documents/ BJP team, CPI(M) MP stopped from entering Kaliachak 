Ten persons have been arrested.The fact-finding team comprising three MPs — Bhupendra Yadav, S.S. Ahluwalia and B.D. Ram — was constituted by the party’s national president Amit Shah on Sunday and were to submit a report to him after the visit.There was large deployment of police in and around the railway station when the MPs reached there at 6.10 a.m. They were escorted to the waiting room and after three hours were asked to take the train back to Kolkata.“Under pressure from the State government, the district administration said that Section 144 [banning unlawful assembly] was promulgated in the area. We told them that we are not here to incite or instigate anybody but to console people,” Mr. Ahluwalia told journalists. Another member, Bhupendra Yadav, said the delegation wanted to know the truth but were forcibly sent back.On reaching Howrah station, members of the delegation said they will submit a report to Mr. Amit Shah. Later in the evening, the MP from the adjoining Raiganj Lok Sabha constituency, Mohd Salim, was also prevented from entering Kaliachak. The police detained the MP for a few hours and then released him.
