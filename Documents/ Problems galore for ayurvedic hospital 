Those getting admitted to the Government Ayurvedic hospital at Girmajipet are a unhappy lot. Not that they do not get treatment but they are sore over the facilities available there.The hospital is plagued by shortage of staff, medicines and poor maintenance for a long time. It is a 60-bed hospital primarily meant for patients of paralysis, knee and joint pains and other ailments common among elderly.Speaking to The Hindu , Hospital Superintendent Suddala Rajamouli said since he took charge about two years ago, the situation did not change.Though they have been asking for more funds from the government, there was no response.The ayurvedic hospital was established in 1956 as a private Ayurvedic Medical College and teaching hospital and was later taken over by the government in 1968. According to the government norms, for a 60-bed there should 61 staff members. There are 26 vacancies now. Dr. Rajamouli said they require 60 litres of various kinds of oils and Rs. 20 lakh worth medicine every month. But they only receive Rs. 4 lakh worth medicine and the inadequate quantify of raw material. The patients are forced to face endless woes and there is no X-ray lab in the hospital. After the radiographer left three years ago, nobody has been appointed in his place, rendering the lab useless. The lab is now run by only one technician and if he takes leave, it remains closed.In the panchakarma department, steam bath machine which was used for many treatments does not get funds to buy gas required for it. Patients who require it should bring their own gas and undergo treatment. The patients complain they are not being provided with proper food as the diet contractor was not monitored by the officials.Of late many private institutions have come up offering `panchakarmaâ€™ treatment luring away the patients from government ayurvedic hospital.
