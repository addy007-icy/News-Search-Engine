Leader of the Opposition V.S. Achuthanandan on Saturday said the State Police Departmentâ€™s special drive against moneylenders was a farce.In a statement here on Saturday, he said Operation Kubera was just an avenue for corruption. He cited the case of a housewife who took a loan of Rs.6 lakh from a loan shark. She had pledged her property as collateral. She repaid Rs.10.5 lakh as principal and interest. However, the moneylender would not release her property or return the title deed. He demanded an extra Rs.45 lakh from her.The woman approached the police. However, Mr. Achuthanandan alleged, the investigation against the moneylender was thwarted at the behest of the Home Department. The investigating officer in the case was removed thrice to help the loan shark, he alleged.The incident had drawn sharp criticism from the High Court. Mr. Achuthanandan said Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala who had touted Operation Kubera as one of his flagship programmes, should step down in the wake of the criticism. The initiative was actually a tool to extort money from loan sharks as well as their hapless victims.
