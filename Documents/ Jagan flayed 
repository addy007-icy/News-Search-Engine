Senior TDP Leader and MLC Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu on Sunday, flayed the remarks of YSR Congress president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, who alleged misuse and sought Lokayukta enquiry into the welfare schemes envisaged by the State government. Addressing the media, Mr. Naidu reacted sharply to the statements and dared the YSRC to go ahead seeking an enquiry into the allegations. “We welcome their demand for a probe, but the Lokayukta enquiry should begin from the year 2004. Will Mr. Jagan agree to this?” he questioned.Mr. Naidu further blamed the Congress, particularly during the tenure of Former Chief Minister Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy, and asserted that they were responsible for looting the people's money.“They have amassed more than Rs. 10 lakh crore (including party leaders), with Mr. Rajasekhara Reddy's family amounting to Rs.1.5 lakh crore via means of large scale corruption and land grabbing,” he added. Reiterating their party's stance for an enquiry, Mr. Naidu challenged Mr. Reddy to write a letter to Lokayukta on the irregularities, which took place during allocations pension and ration cards, construction and allotment of Indiramma Houses and much more. He flayed PCC president N. Raghuveera Reddy for supporting the party leader Malladi Vishnu, an the accused in the spurious liquor tragedy case in Vijayawada.
