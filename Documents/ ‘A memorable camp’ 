NCC cadets across the country cherished the moments at the National Integration Camp held here and said that it was a true cross-cultural experience to share and live with cadets from different parts of the country.“The biggest take away from the camp is learning about the diverse languages and cultures in the country. The camp has given me self confidence to speak in front of a large audience. The camp also strengthened my resolve to become an Air Force Officer,” said Soumya Sharma.“The NIC has taught me some of the fundamental things and I have learnt to accept other cultures. A true integration is possible only when we learn to accept different cultures and India being a melting point of various cultures, languages, camps like these foster national integrity,’’ said Satyendra Kumar. “I have been pursuing graduation in Journalism and Mass Communication and I have been using my skills in reporting and photographing the activities of the camp,” said Sargant Manish Kumar from Delhi.“This is my fifth camp and the first one in Andhra Pradesh and I have fond memories of the visits to various places in the district,” said Minnu from Kerala.
