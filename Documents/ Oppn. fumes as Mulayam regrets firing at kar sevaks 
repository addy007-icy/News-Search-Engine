Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh’s remarks that he “felt sad” for ordering the firing on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990 were strongly criticised by the Opposition on Monday even as it brought fresh focus on the controversial issue.Though it was not the first time that Mr. Singh expressed regret over the firing, the timing of his comments, at a time when the Ram Mandir issue is flaring up once again with renewed enthusiasm from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, could have deeper political meaning. Party insiders say the SP brass feels the support of Muslims, on whom it relies heavily, is slipping from its grasp. However, at the same time, the party is also attempting to correct its image vis-a-vis Hindus.In June 2013, Mr. Singh had said the decision to order firing on kar sevaks was “painful” but he had no other choice. His comments, in an interview to a television channel, had come soon after Amit Shah, now BJP chief, visited Ayodhya and vowed the temple would be built in the Uttar Pradesh town.Two months after that, the VHP led a controversial 84-Kosi Parikrama Yatra in Ayodhya, defying prohibitory orders and staging a confrontation with the Akhilesh Yadav government. Opposition parties then accused the SP of a tacit deal with the BJP to polarise voters for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.On Sunday, while addressing party workers on the birth anniversary of socialist leader Karpoori Thakur, Mr. Singh reiterated his point saying though he regretted ordering the firing, it was necessary to save the religious place.The Congress accused Mr. Singh of trying to polarise religious communities by raking up a dead issue. “By regularly referring to the firing on kar sevaks, Mr. Singh is trying to mobilise Muslim support and on the other hand helping the BJP polarise Hindu voters,” party leader Satyadev Tripathi said. The BJP questioned Mr. Singh’s remarks saying “mere regret is not enough” and demanded that he publicly apologise for the firing.
