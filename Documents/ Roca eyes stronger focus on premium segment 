Spain-headquartered bathroom products maker Roca is set to give greater thrust to premium products segment this year to improve market share and meet threats from competition, a top company official said. The company, which sells sanitaryware products for mass segment under Parryware brand and premium products under Roca brand in India, plans to strengthen its exclusive network for Roca brand to boost sales in the retail segment.“In 2015, we added 40 new showrooms and during this calendar year, we plan to set up 20 more outlets to take the total number to 200 for Roca brand. We will primarily be focusing on metros, Tier-1 and Tier-II cities for Roca network,” Pau Abello Pellicer, Managing Director of the firm’s Indian subsidiary, Roca Bathroom Products, told The Hindu.Though retail segment constitutes only 20-30 per cent of Roca brand’s revenue, the segment continues to maintain growth momentum. Bulk orders or the institutional segment accounts for major portion (70-80 per cent) of revenue. Meanwhile, the company has also set up a new hospitality vertical to strengthen Roca business in the hotel segment, which is presently dominated by global brands such as Kohler.“Our presence in hotel segment is very small. Though there is tough competition in the segment with more and more global brands entering India, we intend to grow our business with renewed strategy,” said Mr. Pellicer.
