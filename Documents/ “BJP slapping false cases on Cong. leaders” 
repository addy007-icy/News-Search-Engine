The Congress on Wednesday alleged that the barrage of “false cases” registered against its leader were nothing but a part of political “vengeance” unleashed by BJP governments at the Centre and in Haryana, and asserted that it will “unmask” the evil design of the ruling party.Referring to “false cases” registered against family members of P Chidambaram and Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Shankarsinh Vaghela in Gujarat, Virbhadra Singh, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged that the ruling party was doing it to disguise its failures at the governance front.Apparently referring to the National Herald case, in which Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were summoned in a lower court recently, Surjewala alleged the BJP was using “lumpen elements” like Subramanian Swamy to target Congress leadership and shamed the democracy by its “dictatorial” behaviour, he said.“Both the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Manohar Lal Khatar government in Haryana are targeting their political opponents by fabricating opposition leaders in false cases with political vendetta and vengeance,” Mr Surjewala said here.“Gimmickry” and “rhetoric” have become synonymns of Narendra Modi and Khattar, Mr Surjewala said, adding that the BJP rode to power promising good days but has “utterly failed” to govern.To deflect attention from “paralysis of governance”, Modi and Khattar have unleashed a sinister “politics of vendetta” against their rivals, he said.“Defeat, deception and double speak” have become the hallmarks of the BJP both at the national and state level, he said adding that “Incompetence of governance was being sought to be explained by surreptitious blame game on opposition or shifting of focus by malicious acts of foistering false cases on opponents,” he said.“Congress leaders will not be deterred by such acts of ill will or vicious agenda in registration of false cases,” he said, adding that “Congress is determined to give a reply to this autocratic behaviour to Modi and Khattar governments and take the fight to court of people.” - PTI
