Food courts, restaurants, outlets for garments and accessories dot what was once a quiet, well-laid complex of houses and roads.More than 50 per cent of the residential complexes are now commercial outlets engaged in business of one kind or the other, say residents.Former Town Planning Committee chairman of the Corporation of Cochin K.J. Sohan said that the authorities had once decided to impose heavy tax on conversion of residential units into commercial ones without the permission of the Corporation.Panampilly Nagar is around 40 years old and was one of the dream projects for a planned city undertaken by the Greater Cochin Development Authority.Lack of parking space is one of the key problems that stick out when moving through Panampilly Nagar.
