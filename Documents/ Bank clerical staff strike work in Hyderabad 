Customer services across most public sector banks in Hyderabad and many districts of Telangana on Friday were hit following a day's nationwide strike called by the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA).Many bank branches wore a deserted look with clerical cadre employees owing allegiance to the AIBEA abstaining from work. The strike is against the career progression policy being adopted for the staff of the associate banks of the SBI.While the union had put out the strike notice at many branches, the bank management on their part had kept information boards about services not available.The information shared varied from a mere 'strike' to a bit more detailed on how cash transaction is not possible because of the agitation. The practice in banks is to have two keys to the cash chest of which one is with an officer and the other with a clerical cadre staff.Since officers are not part of the strike, at some braches a few such personnel worked and responded to customer queries. But not cash transaction was possible in branches where clerical cadre employees are AIBEA members.What makes the protest worrisome for the customers is that precedes two holidays (second Saturday and Sunday). Thus, for three consecutive days they will not be able to transact any business such as drawing or depositing cash besides submitting cheques.Sources among bank union leaders said that though it is only the AIBEA that has called for strike the impact of the protest will be felt. They counted SBI, Indian Overseas Bank and Bank of Baroda among the banks where the strike is unlikely to make much impact.On the possibility of cash loading in ATM getting hit, sources said that since banks had entrusted that task to private agencies there would be no issues concerning functioning of the facilities. At the RBI chest branches of the banks, both the keys are with the officers.According to sources, services at some old generation private banks in the State have also come under strain.
