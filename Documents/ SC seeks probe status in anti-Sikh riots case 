Thakur asked Additional Solicitor-General Pinki Anand about the SIT probe’s status and fixed the matter after two weeks. “Let them give the status of the probe,” CJI Thakur said.“It is more than 31 years now. Many of the witnesses and even victims have died. There is a need for swiftness in the probe to give solace to the victims,” one of the senior lawyers said.Chief Justice Thakur asked Ms. Anand to find out what progress has been made. The court was hearing a PIL filed by a member of Delhi Gurudwara Management Committee, S. Gurlad Singh Kahlon, seeking various directions to the SIT for speedy justice.
