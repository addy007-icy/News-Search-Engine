Public toilets in North Delhi could soon be managed by beggars and ragpickers who live in the vicinity, if a proposal by an office-bearer of the local civic body is implemented.Vijay Prakash Pandey, a BJP councillor and the chairperson of North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Environment Management Services Committee, had proposed giving the job of maintaining the toilet complexes to beggars and ragpickers in the area during a meeting of the Standing Committee’s special budget session last month.“These people are downtrodden. This proposal is to give them some occupation and to improve the management of our toilets. Since they are from the area, they will know the local issues,” said Mr. Pandey.According to his proposal, the beggars and ragpickers will form a cooperative society or work with NGOs to run the toilet complex. Their salaries as well as expenses for running the complexes will be borne out of the usage fees collected.This proposal will now be deliberated upon in the ongoing Budget session in the corporation, which is in the process of compiling its 2016-2017 Budget. If successful, Mr. Pandey said this format could be replicated for door-to-door garbage collection as well.
