Electricity Minister Aryadan Mohammed has confirmed that a proposal to shift the NTPC power plant had been forwarded by the State government to the Union Ministry of Power. The Union Minister for Power has asked the NTPC to submit a report in this regard, he told The Hindu .The Minister said the decision was taken in view of the non-availability of LNG at Kayamkulam. The foundation stone for the power plant’s expansion project had been laid by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.The project envisaged utilisation of natural gas which could be transported through an undersea pipeline. It was not possible to lay the undersea pipeline owing to objections from fishermen. Laying of pipeline on land from Kochi to Kayamkulam too faced problems of land acquisition, the Minister said.The KSEB has land available at Brahmapuram which could be utilised for setting up the power plant. The GAIL pipeline connecting Puthuvype to BPCL Kochi, one of the mass consumers of LNG, passes through Brahmapuram. He hoped that the availability of natural gas would facilitate smooth operation of the plant there.– Special Correspondent
