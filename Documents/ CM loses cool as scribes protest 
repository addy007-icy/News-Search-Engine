Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu on Monday lost his cool as journalists staged a protest demanding operationalization of the Health Insurance scheme.Taken aback for a moment by the protest during the third phase of the ‘Janmabhoomi Maa Vooru’ programme at Rayavaram village in Prakasam district, “This is not the way to raise any issue. You are doing a disservice to your cause. I will not yield to such blackmailing tactics. He referred to ultras mingling with people and creating trouble elsewhere in the country and made it clear “I will not be cowed down by intimidatory tactics.”Later, he told a delegation of APUWJ leaders that he would render justice to them if they brought any issue concerning them in a disciplined manner. The scribes urged the government to pay its share of the insurance premium as the scheme remained inactive even after nine months of this fiscal had lapsed.
