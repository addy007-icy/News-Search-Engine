Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday eulogised Dr. Ambedkar’s struggle and penchant for education, repeating the Dalit icon’s mantra of ‘educate, agitate, organise.’Speaking at the 6th convocation of the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University here, Mr. Modi told the students that Dr. Ambedkar’s life was marked by difficulties, insults and neglect but he didn’t waste time in complaining.Mr. Modi also paid tributes to Babasaheb on the premises of the Babasaheb Ambedkar Mahasabha.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to reach out to Dalits during his convocation speech, Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr. Ambedkar criticised Mr. Modi for “blatant hypocrisy.” According to him, the RSS and BJP were trying to suppress the “humane” values of Babasaheb.“The fight is Ambedkarites versus the RSS Vedic philosophy; between equality and inequality. To fight those values and suppress the silent masses who support Ambedkar the RSS is trying to muffle the voice of ‘vibrant Ambedkarites,’” Mr. Ambedkar said.The former MP, however, said it was unlikely that Dalits would fall for such “antics” of the RSS and Mr. Modi in the U.P. elections.
