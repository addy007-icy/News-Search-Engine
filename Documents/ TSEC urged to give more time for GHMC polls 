Former Minister Marri Sashidhar Reddy has urged the Telangana State Election Commission to seek more time from the High Court to conduct the GHMC polls after the preparatory ground work is completed by the government.In a letter addressed to the TSEC Election Commissioner on Sunday, Mr. Reddy said that the commission should act as the constitutional body, mandated to conduct the elections in a fair and free manner without being influenced by the party in power or the government of the day. He mentioned that the TSEC cannot go back on the submissions made to the High Court about the requirement of 45 days after the ground work for the completion of election process. He noted that the Commission can not proceed to comply with the directions of the High Court to complete the election process by January 31 without the preparatory work being complete by the Government by December 15.Mr. Reddy accused the Government of delaying the preparatory ground work and reminded the Commission that at the all party meeting held on December 29, all parties except the TRS and the MIM had favoured sufficient time to the political parties to prepare for the elections.The senior Congress leader referred to the remarks made by the Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao at a press conference on Saturday night that the TSEC would decide whether elections are to be held. He said parties are now sure that the Governmentâ€™s delay in ward reservations was deliberate to give the ruling party advantage as they have full knowledge of the reservations and are keen to have the elections before the deadline set by the High Court.
