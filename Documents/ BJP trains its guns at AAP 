Coming out in defence of Chetan Sanghi, the BJP on Monday slammed the AAP government for “unduly pressurising” the officer, who was the chairperson of the inquiry committee looking into the alleged DDCA scam. The party has accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of “plotting a conspiracy” against the bureaucracy by influencing the Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB).Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, accused the AAP leader and Standing Counsel Rahul Mehra of pressurising Chetan Sanghi while drafting the probe report on the alleged scam. “He was being forced to name Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the report on the probe, of which Mr. Mehra was also a committee member. This has been revealed by Mr. Sanghi himself in a letter to the Union Home Secretary,” Mr Gupta said. Reading the letter, he added that Mr. Sanghi had admitted that there was pressure on him to name a ‘VIP’.The BJP MLA from Rohini said senior AAP leaders had used their clout to get Mr. Mehra to name the Union Finance Minister in the report. “The sole purpose of pressurising him to add Mr. Jaitley’s name in the report was to gain political mileage by defaming the BJP stalwart. Mr. Sanghi refused to succumb to the pressure and did not name the senior leader in the 337-page report that was filed in just three days. As a result of his defiance, he had to face the music from the senior AAP leadership,” he said.
