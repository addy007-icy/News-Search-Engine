Having authored three books before his political innings, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said he is willing to pen some non-fiction but is reluctant to write an autobiography.During an interaction at Tata Steel Bhubaneswar Literary Meet here on Saturday evening, the writer-turned-politician said he is not keen on writing an autobiography as he feels it would not be interesting.Stating that he would prefer to pen non-fictions if time permits, Mr.Patnaik, who has been winning all elections since 1997, was non-committal when asked whether he would write a book on how to win elections.Emphasising on the need to focus on regional languages, Mr.Patnaik said literature is something that gives meaningful insight into life. Volumes of literature are created in various regional languages but do not get the limelight they deserve, the four-time Chief Minister said.“Therefore, it is pertinent to mention that we now need to focus on translation for the growth of local literature,” he added.“Translation of regional writings to other regional and mainstream languages can bridge the literary divide between mainstream writing and regional writing,” he said, adding Hindi translation of Sarala Mahabharat is a step in right direction and more such initiatives should be taken.Speaking on the occasion, Tata Steel managing director T. V. Narendran said Odia literature has a rich legacy of eminent writers and marvellous collections of their work. - PTI
