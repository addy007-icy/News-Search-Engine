While its impact on the city's air quality remains a matter of debate, the odd even policy trial fortnight came to an end on Friday.In the 15 days during the scheme's implementation, Delhi Traffic Police challaned 9144 violators who together paid a consolidated fine amount of Rs. 1.82 crore.Nearly a quarter of those challaned (22 per cent) were challaned on West Delhi's Rohtak Road. As far as the distribution of the recorded violations according to region was concerned, South Delhi topped this list. These prosecutions were primarily at junctions close to Delhi's border posts with Noida (Kalindi Kunj) and Faridabad (Badarpur).The traffic police officers said they observed an average of 90 per cent compliance on all the days. On this count, Lutyens' zone located C Hexagon recorded the lowest average number of prosecutions per day out of all the major locations where police teams were present.The compliance rate helped the police, acknowledged officers albeit adding that threat of congestion also proved a challenge in implementing it more strictly.“The focus was largely on educating people about the scheme along with prosecutions,” said Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Dr. Muktesh Chander.Officers added that on an average, 1.25 lakh vehicles stayed off the road on odd number days while a marginally lower number of around 1.17 lakhs cars stayed off during the even number days.
