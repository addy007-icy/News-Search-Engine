A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Friday came to the rescue of a critically ailing nine- month-old baby girl in Thiruvananthapuram, who was being refused treatment for liver cirrhosis by her mother, owing to marital squabbles.Acting on a habeas corpus petition filed by the father of the baby, the Bench comprising Justice C.K. Abdul Rahim and Shaji P. Chaly directed the Thiruvananthapuram City Police Commissioner to take immediate steps to get the baby — Alia Fathima — admitted to a private hospital in the city.Observing that the life of child was in danger, the court also directed the hospital authorities to admit the child and take all necessary follow up actions to save her.The marriage of the child’s father, Basheer of Chowara in Thiruvananthapuram, and his wife had fallen apart and the couple lived separately. Basheer’s daughter was diagnosed with severe liver cirrhosis at KIMS Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram and the doctors had advised a liver transplantation to save her.Basheer alleged that despite his depositing a fee of Rs.5,000 for getting a prospective donor and another Rs.3 lakh, which he had received from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund, with the hospital, his estranged wife and her father were not getting the baby admitted for treatment. He also alleged that they had collected money from the public in the name of treating the baby, while complaining that they had detained the baby, causing threat to her life.When the petition came up for hearing, the court directed the Poojappura sub-inspector to inquire into the allegations and ascertain if any treatment was being provided to the baby in any hospital. The inquiry revealed that due to the quarrels and dispute between her parents, the infant was being denied treatment.Though the hospital had counselled the parents about her deteriorating health condition, the family made no attempts to find a donor or provide any treatment to the baby. The police had even pleaded for a court directive to save her life.The hospital authorities informed the court that their diagnosis confirmed ‘ biliary stasis and cirrhosis’ and the only curative therapy available was a liver transplantation. The follow-up examination of the baby had revealed that her liver function had deteriorated and she had developed “decompensated cirrhosis of the liver.”The court directed the State Bank of Travancore Branch in Thiruvananthapuram to submit a report regarding the availability of funds in the accounts of the wife and father-in-law of the petitioner and restrained the bank from allowing any withdrawal from those accounts.The bench also made it clear that the police could seek the assistance of Childline or the Child Welfare Committee for implementing the court order.
