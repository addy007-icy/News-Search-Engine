One person was arrested for the assault on camerapersons and damage of equipment during erudattam held in a village here on Sunday. The first accused Govindaraj was arrested and two others named accused in the FIR were yet to be arrested.On Sunday evening, two camerapersons of two Tamil dailies and a videographer of a local channel were assaulted and their equipment destroyed, when they attempted to capture visuals of erudattam.Amidst reports that erudattam, a local variant of bull taming was being conducted despite the ban in force on jallikattu, a few photographers had made a bid to take photographs of the event. Objecting to the presence of the media, a few locals, attacked three camerapersons. A case was registered against three persons under Sections 324, 294 B, 506 (1), and 427 of the IPC.However, asked if it was erudattam that was held in violation of the ban, Superintendent of Police R. Thirunavukkarasu said the video recording of the event proved otherwise. The bulls still had a leash and they were accompanied by the respective owners to the temple, in the presence of a large audience that had gathered to view the spectacle. There was no bull taming involved, Mr. Thirunavukkarasu told The Hindu.
