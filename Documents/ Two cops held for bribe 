Two Delhi police constables have been arrested for allegedly demanding bribe from the owner of a delivery van in West Delhi’s Kirti Nagar. A tea vendor who was being used by the policemen to collect the bribe money too was nabbed in the operation.Ever since the Delhi Police’s vigilance department began actively cracking down on corrupt policemen, some of them are using members of the general public as ‘conduit’ to collect the money, a senior vigilance officer revealed. The arrests were made on Friday after the delivery van owner approached the vigilance department with audio clips of the policemen purportedly demanding the bribe.R.K. Jha, DCP (Vigilance), said that the complainant had earlier helped the Kirti Nagar police arrest four persons involved in a theft case. The thieves had used the complainant’s delivery van for the crime because of which the vehicle had been seized by the police.When the complainant approached the police for release of his van, constables Yashpal and Rajpal allegedly demanded Rs 20,000 from him. Negotiations between the two parties brought the bribery amount down to Rs 15,000, to be paid in instalments.Once the vigilance officials had the audio clips of the demands, they asked the complainant to meet the policemen on the pretext of handing over the first instalment of Rs 5,000.The two constables were found at the pre-decided place of the raid. However, they refused to take the money directly from him and directed him to hand it over to Vinod Shah, a tea vendor known to them, said the DCP.Shah was caught red-handed while collecting the money. Soon after, the raiding team arrested the two policemen as well. Based on the complainant’s statement, the constables and their associate have been booked at the vigilance unit’s police station.
