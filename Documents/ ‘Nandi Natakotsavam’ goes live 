To enable the people all over the district to watch the ongoing ‘Nandi Natakotsavam’ live, the Chittoor district administration has effectively utilised the communication network to screen it in all the 66 mandal headquarters towns.The State-level drama festival, currently under way in Tirupati, is receiving overwhelming response from the art-loving crowd. The denizens not only relish the rich content, but also well received the message delivered in the social and mythological plays presented by various cultural troupes.Making use of the communication network available at all the Tehsildar’s offices across the district, which is meant for holding videoconferencing, Collector Siddharth Jain recently directed the officials concerned to explore the possibilities of screening the plays live. Finding it technically feasible, the Information and Public Relations Department recently implemented the idea by airing it live from Mahati auditorium to a couple of mandals. When the pilot project turned successful, it was extended to all mandals in the district.“From Kuppam on the Karnataka border to Satyavedu on the Tamil Nadu border, residents of the 66 mandals in the district get a rare opportunity to watch the plays. It’s a great way of reaching out,” Mr. Jain has told The Hindu . He has also appealed to the Multi-Service Operators (MSOs) across the district to air the plays in their respective channels in the smaller towns like Nagari, Punganur, Palamaner, and Piler.The experiment of the administration to screen it live all over the district proves successful
