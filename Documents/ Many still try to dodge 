: On the first day of its implementation, the Delhi Police adopted a rather liberal approach, and let many odd-even violators go scot-free, though not without a lecture. But many, unaware of the easy approach of the police, had alternative plans to “dodge” the scheme.When he left his Punjabi Bagh residence, Sameer was fully aware of the fact that his petrol car had an even registration number but risked going through a check point, eager to meet his friends in Patel Nagar. Before leaving home, he checked with his friends about the safer route with fewer policemen visible and opted for the “less guarded” route. To his delight, it worked.Another motorist travelling in an SUV with last digit on its number plate being “zero” had come prepared it seemed. He had covered the last digit with a noose like stricture making it invisible. But Mathura Road where The Hindu spotted and followed the vehicle, did not have any policemen to flag him down.The Khaki uniform of some volunteers also deterred commuters as they confused them with policemen. In one such instance near Select City Walk, a motorist first slowed down and suddenly speeded up when all that the volunteer was trying to do was to hand him a red rose and tell him about the drive.
