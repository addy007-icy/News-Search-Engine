The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has demanded that the Congress to spell out whether it would stand by the kin of those who died after consuming spurious liquor or its city Congress president Malladi Vishnu.Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Telugu Desam Party State general secretary Varla Ramaiah took objection to the visit of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president N. Raghuveera Reddy to the sub jail where Mr. Malladi Vishnu has been lodged. “The PCC president, it appears, is more interested in consoling his party colleague,” he said.
