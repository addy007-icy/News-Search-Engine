The Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council (KRLCC) has said it would continue its policy of maintaining equidistance from the two major political fronts even as it demanded that the Latin community get representation in proportion to its population in the coming elections to the Assembly.In a statement, the council said that it would be above majority-minority considerations and highlight the problems the people of the State were facing.A political resolution passed at the end of the 27th general assembly of the Council expressed concern over the efforts to divide society on communal lines. Using caste to achieve political ends would be disastrous, the statement added.Caste-based reservations should continue at the State and national-levels. Recent reports had indicated that the fruits of reservation had not reached the backward communities, the statement claimed.
