The port city, longing to see a Test match played on its soil, will realise its dream when England is most likely to play a Test against India at the ACA-VDCA stadium this year itself.Big time cricket is coming back to the city after more than two years. The last One-Day International was held here in November, 2013 against West Indies while another ODI with the Caribbeans in October 2014 was cancelled due to Hudhud cyclone. The Sri Lankas are coming here after a gap of nine years and this match is to be followed by an ODI with New Zealand before the much-awaited Test happens.This is the information gathered after the Andhra Cricket Association held its meeting here on Saturday to discuss arrangements for the Twenty20 match with New Zealand. ACA president D.V.S.S. Somayajulu presided and secretary and MP G. Gangaraju explained the activities of ACA during the past few months. Mr. Gangaraju announced that Chairman of Visakhapatnam Port Trust M.T. Krishnababu would head the organising committee for conducting the T20 match.Mr. Krishnababu said no effort would be spared to conduct the match in a successful manner. Sub-committees were formed and all issues like security, traffic regulation, drinking water supply, etc. were discussed in detail.
