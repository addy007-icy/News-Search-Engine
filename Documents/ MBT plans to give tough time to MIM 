The Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) will be fielding 25 candidates in the ensuing GHMC elections in the city and is working out strategies to give its rival the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) tough time in almost all the municipal divisions it will contest.“Our fight is with the AIMIM party. The electorate are no more interested in communal politics and now demand development. We are contesting from Old City areas where people recognise our work and will vote for us,” MBT leader Amjedullah Khan said.MBT floated by Mohd. Amanullah Khan in 1993 after snapping links with the Majlis party had won few seats during the previous 2002 municipal elections.In 2009 GHMC elections, it confined itself to just Azampura seat with Amjedullah Khan emerging victorious.“Last time, we lost around 12 seats with a small margin of 500 to 1,000 votes, it was due to electoral malpractices. This time if everything goes off in a democratic and peaceful manner we will definitely win more seats,” he explained.The party is likely to give tough fight to the Majlis party in Jangammet, Barkas, Uppuguda, Dabeerpura, Akbar Bagh, Azampura and a few other divisions.The party is also fielding non-Muslim candidates from Lalitha Bagh, and Gowlipura.
