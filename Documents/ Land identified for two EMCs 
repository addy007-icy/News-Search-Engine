Land has been identified in Pendurthi and Kapulauppada for establishing two Electronic Manufacturing Clusters.The clusters mooted as part of the Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) will offer several incentives to investors, including stamp duty and registration reimbursement, power concession, 50 per cent subsidy on infrastructure, and 25 per cent subsidy on capital expenditure.The State government is now preparing to submit detailed project reports along with land identified for the clusters to the Department of Electronics and IT in the Ministry of Communication and IT (DeitY).An official of the DeitY told The Hindu that they were keen on sanctioning EMCs across the country as part of the National Policy on Electronics.The Centre will release funds for creating the infrastructure so as to attract investments in the electronics sector, which is poised for big growth due to significant increase in comfort level of people and their dependence on various devices and gadgets.High demandThe electronics policy of Andhra Pradesh for 2014-20 states that the demand in the Indian market was $70 billion in 2013-14. This, as per industry projections, will go up to $ 400 billion.With the State awarding e-Pragati designing project to Wipro involving an amount of Rs.400 crore and plans to provide 10-20 Mbps connection to each household as part optic fibre grid project, the market for electronics industry will grow manifold.IT Minister Palle Raghunadha Reddy told entrepreneurs here recently that the government would expedite work on not only the two EMCs in the city but also to develop Visakhapatnam into a mega electronics hub. An electronics bazaar is also proposed in the city.The EMC proposed at Parawada in an extent of 100 acres could not be grounded as the DeitY officials found the site unsuitable due to location of hills and Jawaharlal Nehru Pharma City in the vicinity.Society for Applied Microwave Electronic Engineering & Research (SAMEER), an autonomous organisation under DeitY, which has been allotted 13 acres at Gambheeram for setting up a R&D lab with an investment of Rs.80 crore, was originally planned as the anchor project of the EMC at Parawada.
