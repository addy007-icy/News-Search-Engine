The Jadavpur University Vice-Chancellor was gheraoed by agitating students for more than 12 hours. The students were demanding immediate elections to the students’ council.The agitation started with the State Government’s recent advisory to the University authorities urging it not to hold students’ council polls in February as several Board examinations will be held in that month.Contrary to V-C Suranjan Das’ claim that the polls have been put on hold as per the instructions of the Chancellor, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, the students have demanded a tripartite meeting involving Executive Council’s members, students’ representatives and the Chancellor.“So far the V-C has neither given any assurance about the meeting and has not even announced its date,” Soumannya Raha, a member of the Arts Faculty Students’ Union (AFSU) told The Hindu on Saturday.The >University campus was rocked by students’ agitation in 2014 over the alleged molestation of a female student and police crackdown on agitating students in the campus. The agitation resulted in the resignation of the then V-C Abhijit Chabkrabarti.The State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee has criticised the students’ agitation and dubbed it “politically motivated.”
