The regionâ€™s persistent appeal that the Calicut Airport at Karipur should not be deprived of its international status will be placed before Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju at an interface organised by Calicut Chamber of Commerce here on January 30.Chamber secretary Abdullah Maliyekal told reporters on Thursday that this was an opportunity for Kozhikode to voice its apprehension that with the new airport coming up at Kannur, the Karipur airport would lose its international status and have domestic services also scaled down.A representation would also be made to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is expected to inaugurate the Global Ayurveda Festival here on February 2. Elected representatives and heads of organisations who have taken up the issue of the airport have been invited to take part in both the events.The runway works must be completed soon to enable resumption of direct Haj flights in time for the pilgrimage this year, the chamber said, pointing out that after opening booking of seats in November 2015, for its Jeddah and Riyadh flights, Air India had withdrawn it. The Chamber said that in March last year, Emirates and Saudi Airlines proposed to operate the large Code E flights from Calicut Airport.
