Anxious parents of students of a private school on Avinashi Road in the heart of the city gathered at the campus on Monday, worried that the school management might deny their wards entry into classrooms.LettersThe management had sent letters to the parents saying the students would not be allowed into class when school reopened on January 04, 2016, if they had not paid the fees by December 15, 2015.Some of the parents alerted the School Education Department and the officials visited the school to inquire into the issue. Sources said that the officials promised to look into the matter of how the management had sent the letters about the fees when the fee amount had not yet been determined.The Inspector of Anglo Indian Schools was supposed to fix the fee for students after the parents disputed the fee the school had demanded.The parents moved the fee determination committee and in appeal against the committee order the school moved the Madras High Court.The Court asked the Inspector to fix the fees.The parents said that they were ready to abide by the fee the Inspector of Anglo Indian Schools fixed.
