Garbage collection in Mangaluru City Corporation limits came to a standstill on Tuesday after the contractor, Antony Waste Handling Cell Pvt. Ltd., stopped lifting garbage from doorsteps on the ground that the civic body has not paid about Rs. 10 crore due to it.While garbage was not lifted from the doors of residents, streets were not cleaned even as garbage-carrying vehicles remained in their yard. Consequently, garbage was not sent to the Pachchanadi dumping yard.
