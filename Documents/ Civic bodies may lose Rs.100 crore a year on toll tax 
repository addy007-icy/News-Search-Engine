The Capital’s municipal corporations, which have been struggling to make ends meet for a year, may now end up earning Rs.100 crore less annually from toll tax – one of their biggest revenue sources.The private concessionaire that collects toll tax from 124 border entry points was allowed to exit the contract with the corporations by the Supreme Court on Thursday. This comes after the apex court had ordered the contractor – SMYR Consortium – to collect an additional environmental compensation charge (ECC) from commercial vehicles entering Delhi from November 1 last year.The reluctant contractor started collecting Rs.700 or Rs.1,300 (depending on vehicle size) green tax from November 6, 2015, and has been paying the corporations less every week. The contractor has been citing a loss of revenue due to trucks giving Delhi a miss in order to not pay the additional ECC.Officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for toll tax collection, said the contract has become unworkable, which the court also acknowledged. While the contractor claims there has been a 40 per cent reduction in traffic, the SDMC says it is less. The civic body had a survey done at the DND and Badarpur toll points, which are run by different companies, and found that there was a 20 per cent reduction.The three-year contract with SMYR Consortium started in May 2015, and was supposed to net the three corporations Rs.541 crore a year.
